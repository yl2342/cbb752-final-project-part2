    - Run time: < 1 minute

## Usage

The workflow consists of two main steps:

### 1. Search open access full text articles from PubMed Central
For each prioritized gene, we fetched n (5) full text articles (sort by relevance) from PubMed Central. We parse the full text articles and save them as JSON files in the `pmc_full_texts` directory.

```shell
python pmc_fulltext_fetcher.py -l prioritized_gene_from_part1.txt -n 5
```

This will:
- Search top 5 relevant open access PMC full text articles for each prioritized gene
- Save the results to `pmc_full_texts/<gene>_pmc_fulltext.json`. For each full text article retrieved, it contains the following fields:
  - pmcid
  - title
  - published_date
  - full_text

### 2. Analyze the Retrieved Literature with Gemini AI
Process all collected PMC publications for the prioritized genes to integrate the part II instruction into to prompt LLM to generate the overall summary. Then with the constructed summary embeded as the sequential prompt, ask LLM to do external database search on uniProt and generate the comparative analysis report. 

 Gemini AI to conduct a comprehensive analysis as required.

```shell
python llm_mining.py 
# type gemini-2.0-flash-lite in the terminal when first prompted for model name for the overall summary task
# type gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 in the terminal when prompted for model name for the comparative analysis task
```

This will:
- Load all the PMC full text articles from `pmc_full_texts/`
- Generate a prompt embeded with the part II instruction for the overall summary task, stored in `prompts/overall_summary_prompt.txt` (more than 500k tokens estimated). Call the Gemini API use the `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` model to generate the overall summary and save the overall summary to `llm_responses/overall_summary.txt`
- With the overall summary embeded as the sequential prompt, construct a new prompt and save it to `prompts/comparative_analysis_prompt.txt` for the comparative analysis task with Google search grounding tool, call the Gemini API use the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model to generate the comparative analysis report and save the report to `llm_responses/comparative_analysis.txt`. (The grounding search results is saved in `llm_responses/comparative_analysis_grounding.json`)

Note:
- when asked to type model name in the terminal, first make sure the input and estimated output tokens are within the rate limit
- You can also find extra information in the logs/ and debug/ subdirectories.

### **Overall Summary**

The 50 articles, focusing on 10 genes, reveal a complex interplay of molecular mechanisms with implications for various human diseases, particularly cancer and neurological disorders. The most frequent and important biological terms identified include:

*   **Cellular Processes:** Apoptosis, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and autophagy are frequently mentioned, highlighting the dynamic nature of the cellular responses under investigation.
*   **Molecular Players:** Key proteins like MYO18B, PACSIN2, SEZ6L, and TAFA5 emerge as central to the studies. These proteins are often linked to other important molecules like BACE1, Wnt/PKC signaling pathway, and the complement system.
*   **Disease Associations:** The articles frequently mention associations with cancer (gastric, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma), neurological disorders (epilepsy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Niemann-Pick type C disease), and cardiovascular diseases (chronic venous disease).

**Correlations Between Terms**

Several correlations between terms are evident:

*   **MYO18B and Cancer:** The gene MYO18B is linked to both muscle function and cancer progression. High expression of MYO18B is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (PMCID: 7378193).
*   **PACSIN2 and Cellular Processes:** PACSIN2 is implicated in regulating podocyte architecture, cell migration, and autophagy (PMCID: 10252800, 9811133). Its phosphorylation status at S313 is linked to increased circulating free fatty acids and kidney dysfunction (PMCID: 10252800).
*   **SEZ6L and Neurological Disorders:** The BACE1-cleavage of Sez6 and Sez6L is elevated in Niemann-Pick type C disease mouse brains (PMCID: 6034874).
*   **TAFA5 and Cancer:** TAFA5 promotes proliferation and migration in gastric cancer (PMCID: 6797941).

**Implications for Disease**

The identified correlations suggest several disease implications:

*   **Cancer:** The upregulation of MYO18B, TAFA5, and TBC1D22A in various cancers (gastric, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma) suggests these genes may be potential therapeutic targets. The role of TAFA5 in promoting proliferation and migration in gastric cancer (PMCID: 6797941) is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Neurological Disorders:** The involvement of SEZ6L in BACE1 cleavage and its association with neurological disorders like Niemann-Pick type C disease (PMCID: 6034874) highlights the potential of BACE1 inhibitors in treating these conditions. The role of TAFA5 in the spinal cord and its potential as a therapeutic target for pain relief (PMCID: 9194834) is also significant.
*   **Metabolic Disorders:** The link between PACSIN2 phosphorylation, increased free fatty acids, and kidney dysfunction (PMCID: 10252800) suggests a role for PACSIN2 in metabolic disorders.
*   **Potential Therapeutic Targets:** The identification of specific molecular interactions, such as the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex in endothelial migration (PMCID: 9235069), provides potential targets for therapeutic interventions. The role of TAFA5 in the spinal cord and its potential as a therapeutic target for pain relief (PMCID: 9194834) is also significant.

The studies also highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between genes, cellular processes, and disease. For example, the role of the Wnt/PKC signaling pathway in cerebral ischemic injury (PMCID: 7072880) and the involvement of the complement system in neurological disorders (PMCID: 8081827) provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies.

### **Comparative Analysis with External Databases UniProt**
Comparative Analysis with UniProt Database

This analysis compares the findings from the provided literature summary with information available in the UniProt database for the ten specified genes.

SYN3 (Synapsin-3):
UniProt function aligns with the summary, indicating involvement in neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. The summary's mention of potential links to neuropsychiatric diseases is supported by UniProt's annotation regarding its localization to synaptic vesicles and role in modulating neurotransmitter release, consistent with a role in neuronal function.

EFCAB6 (EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 6):
UniProt describes EFCAB6 as a negative regulator of the androgen receptor and a component of motile cilia. The summary did not extensively cover these specific functions. UniProt also notes its calcium binding activity, which is consistent with its name. The summary's focus was not on these molecular details.

LARGE1 (Xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase LARGE1):
UniProt confirms LARGE1 as a glycosyltransferase crucial for the maturation of alpha-dystroglycan, essential for skeletal muscle and brain function. This strongly supports the summary's implication of LARGE1 in neurological disorders and its potential role in muscle function, as alpha-dystroglycan is vital for anchoring the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in these tissues. UniProt also links mutations to congenital muscular dystrophies like Walker-Warburg syndrome, reinforcing the disease associations in the summary.

CELSR1 (Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1):
UniProt describes CELSR1 as a receptor potentially involved in cell-cell signaling during nervous system formation and planar cell polarity. The summary links CELSR1 to the Wnt/PKC signaling pathway and cerebral ischemic injury, which aligns with its role in nervous system signaling. UniProt also mentions its involvement in neural tube defects and lymphedema, expanding on the disease associations noted in the summary.

PACSIN2 (Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons protein 2):
UniProt confirms PACSIN2's role in vesicle-mediated transport, endocytosis (including caveolae and EGF receptor), and endothelial organization/migration. This aligns well with the summary's findings on PACSIN2's involvement in regulating podocyte architecture, cell migration, and autophagy, as these processes often involve vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. UniProt also notes interactions with proteins like EHD1, EHD2, EHD3, and MICALL1, supporting the summary's mention of the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex. UniProt links PACSIN2 to poor metabolism of thiopurines and microvillus inclusion disease, providing additional disease context not explicitly in the summary.

CECR2 (Chromatin remodeling regulator CECR2):
UniProt identifies CECR2 as a regulatory subunit of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes involved in DNA-templated processes like replication, transcription, and repair. It also highlights its role in embryogenesis, neural tube closure, and spermatogenesis. The summary did not detail CECR2's function, so UniProt provides significant additional context regarding its molecular role in chromatin remodeling and developmental processes, including a link to neural tube defects (Cat Eye Syndrome).

SEZ6L (Seizure 6-like protein):
UniProt indicates SEZ6L may contribute to specialized endoplasmic reticulum functions in neurons. The summary's focus on SEZ6L's cleavage by BACE1 and association with neurological disorders like Niemann-Pick type C disease is a specific finding from the literature analysis that complements the broader neuronal localization suggested by UniProt.

TAFA5 (Chemokine-like protein TAFA-5):
UniProt describes TAFA5 as a chemokine-like protein regulating cell proliferation and migration via GPCRs, and notes its expression predominantly in the brain. This strongly supports the summary's findings on TAFA5 promoting proliferation and migration in gastric cancer and its role in the spinal cord and pain relief. UniProt also mentions its involvement in macrophage migration and inhibition of osteoclast formation, adding further functional details. UniProt links TAFA5 to cerebral small vessel disease, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis, expanding the disease associations.

MYO18B (Unconventional myosin-XVIIIb):
UniProt suggests MYO18B is involved in intracellular trafficking in muscle cells and may regulate muscle-specific genes in the nucleus. It also notes a potential role in tumor development and progression, with restored expression suppressing growth in lung cancer cells. This aligns with the summary's link between MYO18B and muscle function and cancer progression, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma. UniProt also associates mutations with Klippel-Feil syndrome 4 with nemaline myopathy, adding a specific muscular disorder link.

TBC1D22A (TBC1 domain family member 22A):
UniProt suggests TBC1D22A acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Rab family proteins and is predicted to be active in the Golgi apparatus. The summary did not provide specific functional details for TBC1D22A beyond its upregulation in various cancers. UniProt links TBC1D22A to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, providing specific neurological disease associations not present in the summary.

Consistencies:
There is strong consistency between the literature summary and UniProt regarding the general functions and disease areas for LARGE1, PACSIN2, MYO18B, and TAFA5, particularly their roles in cellular processes like migration and proliferation, and associations with neurological disorders and cancer. The neuronal function of SYN3 is also consistent.

Discrepancies/Additional Information from UniProt:
UniProt provides more detailed molecular functions (e.g., specific protein interactions, enzymatic activities, subcellular localization) and broader or more specific disease associations for several genes (EFCAB6, CECR2, PACSIN2, TAFA5, TBC1D22A) than were evident solely from the provided summary. For example, CECR2's role in chromatin remodeling and neural tube defects, EFCAB6's role in androgen receptor regulation and cilia, PACSIN2's link to thiopurine metabolism disorders, TAFA5's role as a chemokine and links to vascular/metabolic diseases, and TBC1D22A's function as a Rab GAP and association with specific epilepsies were not detailed in the summary.

Significance:
The comparative analysis highlights that while text mining of a focused set of literature can identify key themes and disease associations, external databases like UniProt provide a broader and more detailed understanding of protein function, molecular mechanisms, and a wider spectrum of associated conditions. Combining information from both sources offers a more comprehensive view of the genes' biological roles and potential implications. The discrepancies are not necessarily contradictions but rather reflect the different scopes and depths of information captured by focused literature analysis versus comprehensive database annotation. UniProt serves as a valuable resource for validating and expanding upon findings from text mining efforts.

## Results (old, browser chat version)
### Systematic Analysis of PMC Open Access Literature for Prioritized Genes

. Overall Summary based on the provided articles
Across the 50 full-text scientific articles concerning 10 different genes, several biological terms, key findings, and gene-disease associations are frequently discussed. The most frequent and important biological terms across these publications include "gene expression", "protein", "cells", "signaling pathway", "mutation", "knockdown", "transfection", "reversal learning", "apoptosis", and "inflammation".

Key findings and gene-disease associations observed across the articles are diverse, reflecting the varied functions of the genes studied. For example, SYN3 is discussed in the context of synthetic promoters in plants under stress, as a signaling enhancer ameliorating retinal ganglion cell degeneration in diabetic retinopathy, and in relation to reversal learning performance. EFCAB6 is associated with disorders of sex development, motile cilia, melanoma, pain responses in sensory neurons, and cardiac hypertrophy. LARGE1 is linked to α-dystroglycan glycosylation and muscular dystrophy, neuroepithelial tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer prognosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. CELSR1 is implicated in neuroprotection after cerebral ischemic injury, G protein signaling, spina bifida, and lymphedema. PACSIN2 is discussed in relation to podocyte architecture in kidney disease, autophagy and drug cytotoxicity in cancer, drug resistance in leukemia, endocytosis in the kidney, and endothelial migration in angiogenesis. CECR2 is explored for its cytotoxic activity in cancer, binding to acetylated proteins, association with neural tube defects, and role in somatic cell reprogramming. SEZ6L is linked to motor functions and neurodegeneration, and complement regulation. MYO18B is associated with proliferation and migration in gastric cancer, skeletal muscle proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis, hepatocellular carcinoma progression, sarcomere structure, and nemaline myopathy. TBC1D22A is related to prognosis in ovarian cancer, interactions with viral proteins, cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, and genetic epilepsy. TAFA5 is discussed for its role in proliferation and migration in gastric cancer, its function in the spinal cord and pain relief, its association with pulmonary function, and its potential as a biomarker for metabolic disorders.

Correlations between terms reveal interconnected biological processes. For instance, mutations in genes affecting protein function can impact signaling pathways, leading to cellular dysfunction and disease (e.g., EFCAB6 mutations and DSD, CECR2 mutations and neural tube defects). The regulation of gene expression is a recurring theme, often linked to disease pathogenesis or potential therapeutic interventions (e.g., synthetic promoters to control gene expression, altered MYO18B expression in cancer). Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis are frequently discussed in the context of cancer progression and potential targets for therapy (e.g., TAFA5 promoting gastric cancer cell proliferation, MYO18B promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression, PACSIN2's role in apoptosis and cell migration, CECR2's cytotoxic activity). Signaling pathways, such as Wnt/PKC and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, are highlighted as crucial mediators of cellular processes and disease development (e.g., CELSR1 through Wnt/PKC signaling, MYO18B activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR). The concept of drug resistance is explored in several contexts, including cancer treatment and epilepsy, with some genes potentially serving as biomarkers or targets to overcome resistance (e.g., PACSIN2 and drug cytotoxicity/resistance, TBC1D22A and cisplatin resistance).

The implications for disease based on these correlations suggest that common molecular mechanisms and pathways are involved in seemingly disparate conditions. Understanding the interplay between gene mutations, protein function, signaling pathways, and cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis is crucial for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic biomarkers. The involvement of some genes in both developmental disorders and adult-onset diseases highlights their fundamental roles in biological processes throughout life. The tissue-specific functions and expression patterns of these genes also underscore the complexity of disease pathogenesis and the need for context-specific investigations. The exploration of potential drug targets and biomarkers across different diseases associated with these genes offers promising avenues for future research and clinical applications.

2. Comparative Analysis with External Databases UniProt
Comparison of the information extracted from the provided articles with protein function annotations and other information retrieved from UniProt reveals both consistencies and discrepancies in the understanding of these genes.

SYN3: UniProt confirms that Synapsin-3 (SYN3) is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. This is consistent with the article discussing SYN3's role in behavioral flexibility, which is heavily influenced by neurotransmitter dynamics. The article also mentions its involvement in diabetic retinopathy, which affects neuronal cells in the retina, aligning with UniProt's annotation of its function in the nervous system. UniProt also notes ATP and calcium binding, and localization to synaptic vesicle membranes.
EFCAB6: UniProt indicates that EFCAB6 is an EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein that negatively regulates the androgen receptor and is a microtubule inner protein in cilia axonemes required for motile cilia beating. The articles connect EFCAB6 to disorders of sex development (potentially linked to androgen receptor regulation), motile cilia (directly aligning with UniProt's function), melanoma, pain responses in sensory neurons, and cardiac hypertrophy. The association with melanoma, pain, and cardiac hypertrophy are not directly explained by the primary functions listed in UniProt, suggesting potential broader roles or involvement in pathways not yet fully characterized in UniProt.
LARGE1: UniProt describes LARGE1 as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase crucial for the maturation of alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1) through glycosylation, enabling it to bind to extracellular matrix proteins like laminin. This is consistent with the article linking LARGE1 to alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and muscular dystrophy (dystroglycanopathy). UniProt also lists its involvement in muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy congenital with impaired intellectual development and lissencephaly, which aligns with the disease associations found in the articles. The articles also discuss its role in various cancers and spinal muscular atrophy, suggesting broader implications beyond its established role in muscular dystrophy.
CELSR1: UniProt identifies CELSR1 as a receptor involved in cell-cell signaling during nervous system formation and planar cell polarity. This aligns well with the articles discussing its role in neuroprotection in cerebral ischemic injury (related to nervous system function) and spina bifida (a neural tube defect related to developmental signaling and planar cell polarity). The article also mentions its involvement in G protein signaling and lymphedema, which are supported by UniProt's broader functional annotations including G protein-coupled receptor activity and roles in development.
PACSIN2: UniProt states that PACSIN2 regulates the morphogenesis and endocytosis of caveolae, plays a role in intracellular vesicle-mediated transport, and is essential for endothelial organization in sprouting angiogenesis and modulating cell junctions. This is consistent with the articles linking PACSIN2 to podocyte architecture (related to cell morphology and cytoskeleton), endocytosis in the kidney, and endothelial migration in angiogenesis. The articles also discuss its role in autophagy and drug cytotoxicity in cancer, suggesting broader involvement in cellular processes beyond membrane trafficking.
CECR2: UniProt describes CECR2 as a chromatin remodeling regulator that is a subunit of ATP-dependent ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes involved in DNA-templated processes like replication, transcription, and repair. It also recognizes and binds acylated histones. This aligns with the articles discussing CECR2's cytotoxic activity in cancer (related to uncontrolled proliferation and DNA processes), binding to acetylated proteins (directly supported by UniProt), and its role in somatic cell reprogramming (involving significant chromatin changes). The association with neural tube defects is also consistent with UniProt's annotation of CECR2's role in neurulation and development.
SEZ6L: UniProt indicates that SEZ6L is a single-pass type I membrane protein that may contribute to specialized endoplasmic reticulum functions in neurons and is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. The articles link SEZ6L to motor functions and neurodegeneration and complement regulation. UniProt's annotation of tissue specificity showing expression exclusively in the brain, predominantly in neurons, supports its role in neurological functions. The articles' findings on motor coordination deficits and complement regulation suggest specific functional aspects not fully detailed in UniProt's main function annotation.
MYO18B: UniProt identifies MYO18B as an unconventional myosin involved in intracellular trafficking and potentially regulating muscle-specific genes in the nucleus. It is also associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome 4, autosomal recessive, with nemaline myopathy. The articles discuss MYO18B's role in proliferation and migration in gastric cancer, skeletal muscle proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis, hepatocellular carcinoma progression, and sarcomere structure, which aligns with its function as a myosin and its involvement in muscle and cellular movement. The association with nemaline myopathy in the articles is directly supported by UniProt's disease annotation.
TBC1D22A: UniProt suggests that TBC1D22A may act as a GTPase-activating protein for Rab family proteins and is involved in protein homodimerization. The articles link TBC1D22A to prognosis in ovarian cancer, interactions with viral proteins, cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, and genetic epilepsy. UniProt's annotation of its function as a GTPase-activating protein hints at its involvement in cellular signaling and trafficking, which could indirectly relate to these diverse disease associations, though the specific mechanisms are not fully detailed in UniProt.
TAFA5: UniProt describes TAFA5 as a chemokine-like protein that regulates cell proliferation and migration through activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is also an adipokine regulating vascular smooth muscle cells. The articles discuss TAFA5's role in proliferation and migration in gastric cancer (consistent with UniProt's function), its function in the spinal cord and pain relief, its association with pulmonary function, and its potential as a biomarker for metabolic disorders. The roles in the spinal cord, pain relief, pulmonary function, and metabolic disorders suggest broader functions or tissue specificities not fully elaborated in UniProt's main function annotation.
Significance of Consistencies and Discrepancies:

The consistencies between the provided articles and UniProt reinforce the known fundamental biological roles of these genes in processes such as neurotransmission (SYN3), protein glycosylation (LARGE1), cell signaling and polarity (CELSR1), membrane trafficking (PACSIN2), chromatin remodeling (CECR2), and muscle function (MYO18B). These agreements validate the findings presented in the research articles and highlight the well-established functions of these proteins.

The discrepancies and the broader disease associations found in the articles compared to the primary functions listed in UniProt are also significant. They suggest that these genes may have more diverse roles or be involved in complex biological networks that extend beyond their currently well-defined functions in databases like UniProt. These discrepancies indicate potential areas for further research to fully elucidate the multifaceted contributions of these genes to human health and disease. The articles provide valuable context on the clinical relevance and disease associations that can inform and expand the annotations in comprehensive databases like UniProt. The involvement of several genes in multiple seemingly unrelated conditions (e.g., EFCAB6, LARGE1, TBC1D22A, TAFA5) underscores the complexity of genetic influences on disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.

In summary, the comparative analysis reveals that while UniProt provides a solid foundation of known protein functions, the provided articles offer valuable insights into the broader biological contexts, disease associations, and potential therapeutic implications of these genes, highlighting areas where our understanding is still evolving.
