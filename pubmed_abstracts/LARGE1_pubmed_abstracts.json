    "title": "Alteration of LARGE1 abundance in patients and a mouse model of 5q-associated  spinal muscular atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by recessive  pathogenic variants affecting the survival of motor neuron (SMN1) gene (localized on 5q). In consequence, cells lack expression of the corresponding protein. This pathophysiological condition is clinically associated with motor neuron (MN) degeneration leading to severe muscular atrophy. Additionally, vulnerability of other cellular populations and tissues including skeletal muscle has been demonstrated. Although the therapeutic options for SMA have considerably changed, treatment responses may differ thus underlining the persistent need for validated biomarkers. To address this need and to identify novel marker proteins for SMA, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling on cerebrospinal fluid derived (CSF) from genetically proven SMA type 1-3 cases and afterwards performed ELISA studies on CSF and serum samples to validate the potential of a novel biomarker candidates in both body fluids. To further decipher the pathophysiological impact of this biomarker, immunofluorescence studies were carried out on spinal cord and skeletal muscle derived from a 5q-SMA mouse model. Proteomics revealed increase of LARGE1 in CSF derived from adult patients showing a clinical response upon treatment with nusinersen. Moreover, LARGE1 levels were validated in CSF samples of further SMA patients (type 1-3) by ELISA. These studies also unveiled a distinguishment between groups in improvement of motor skills: adult patients do present with lowered level per se at baseline visit while no elevation upon treatment in the pediatric cohort can be observed. ELISA-based studies of serum samples showed no changes in the pediatric cohort but unraveled elevated level in adult patients responding to future intervention with nusinersen, while non-responders did not show a significant increase. Additional immunofluorescence studies of LARGE1 in MN and skeletal muscle of a SMA type 3 mouse model revealed an increase of LARGE1 during disease progression. Our combined data unraveled LARGE1 as a protein dysregulated in serum and CSF of SMA-patients (and in MN and skeletal muscle of SMA mice) holding the potential to serve as a disease marker for SMA and enabling to differentiate between patients responding and non-responding to therapy with nusinersen.",

    "title": "Clinical significance of LARGE1 in progression of liver cancer and the underlying  mechanism.",
    "abstract": "Liver cancer is a malignant disease and causes thousands of death each year. The  prognosis is dismal for patients with metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to disclose the cause and mechanism underlying liver cancer. LARGE1 encodes a glycosyltransferase and was reported to promote progression in cancer. But its role in liver cancer is unknown. In this study, LARGE1 displayed upregulated expression in liver cancer cells. When LARGE1 was knocked down in SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells, the ability of cell proliferation and colony formation were decreased significantly. Cell migration and invasion were suppressed. The number of cells in G1 phase increased but decreased in S phase. Cell apoptosis was not affected. Tumor growth in vivo was also inhibited. Tumor volume was decreased from 1270 mm(3) to 721 mm(3) (p < 0.05) and tumor weight from 0.95 g to 0.63 g (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression of beta-catenin, TCF and Cyclin D1 was reduced when LARGE1 was knocked down but increased in LARGE1-overexpressed cells. LGK-974, a specific inhibitor in canonical Wnt signaling, inhibited cell proliferation even when LARGE1 was over-expressed. In tumor tissues, LARGE1 was increased by 4.8 folds compared to paratumoral tissues. And higher LARGE1 expression caused shorter survival. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that LARGE1 was associated with TNM stage (\u2160/\u2161 vs III/IV, p = 0.005). Therefore, LARGE1 promotes progression and regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in liver cancer.",

    "title": "Exogenous expression of the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 restores alpha-dystroglycan  matriglycan and laminin binding in rhabdomyosarcoma.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: alpha-Dystroglycan is the highly glycosylated component of the  dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that binds with high-affinity to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins containing laminin-G-like (LG) domains via a unique heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-beta1,3-Xyl-alpha1,3-](n) called matriglycan. Changes in expression of components of the DGC or in the O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan result in muscular dystrophy but are also observed in certain cancers. In mice, the loss of either of two DGC proteins, dystrophin or alpha-sarcoglycan, is associated with a high incidence of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). In addition, glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan is aberrant in a small cohort of human patients with RMS. Since both the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and its function as an ECM receptor require over 18 post-translational processing enzymes, we hypothesized that understanding its role in the pathogenesis of RMS requires a complete analysis of the expression of dystroglycan-modifying enzymes and the characterization of alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in the context of RMS. METHODS: A series of cell lines and biopsy samples from human and mouse RMS were analyzed for the glycosylation status of alpha-dystroglycan and for expression of the genes encoding the responsible enzymes, in particular those required for the addition of matriglycan. Furthermore, the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 was ectopically expressed in RMS cells to determine its effects on matriglycan modifications and the ability of alpha-dystroglycan to function as a laminin receptor. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of a collection of primary RMS tumors show that although alpha-dystroglycan is consistently expressed and glycosylated in these tumors, alpha-dystroglycan lacks matriglycan and the ability to bind laminin. Similarly, in a series of cell lines derived from human and mouse RMS, alpha-dystroglycan lacks matriglycan modification and the ability to bind laminin. RNAseq data from RMS cell lines was analyzed for expression of the genes known to be involved in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation, which revealed that, for most cell lines, the lack of matriglycan can be attributed to the downregulation of the dystroglycan-modifying enzyme LARGE1. Ectopic expression of LARGE1 in these cell cultures restored matriglycan to levels comparable to those in muscle and restored high-affinity laminin binding to alpha-dystroglycan. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a lack of matriglycan on alpha-dystroglycan is a common feature in RMS due to the downregulation of LARGE1, and that ectopic expression of LARGE1 can restore matriglycan modifications and the ability of alpha-dystroglycan to function as an ECM receptor.",

    "title": "A novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion expanding the molecular alterations associated with  the methylation class of neuroepithelial tumors with PATZ1 fusions.",
    "abstract": "A novel DNA methylation class of tumor within the central nervous system, the  \"neuroepithelial tumor (NET), PATZ1 fusion-positive\" has recently been identified in the literature, characterized by EWSR1- and MN1-PATZ1 fusions. The cellular origin of this tumor type remains unknown, wavering between glioneuronal or mesenchymal (as round cell sarcomas with EWSR1-PATZ1 of the soft tissue). Because of the low number of reported cases, this tumor type will not be added to the 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Herein, we report one case of a CNS tumor classified by DNA methylation analysis as NET-PATZ1 but harboring a novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion which has until now never been described in soft tissue or the CNS. We compare its clinical, histopathological, immunophenotypical, and genetic features with those previously described in NET-PATZ1. Interestingly, the current case presented histopathological (astroblastoma-like features, glioneuronal phenotype), clinical (with a favorable course), genetic (1p loss), and epigenetic (DNA-methylation profiling) similarities to previously reported cases of NET-PATZ1. Our results added data suggesting that different histomolecular tumor subtypes seem to be included within the methylation class \"NET, PATZ1 fusion-positive\", including non PATZ1 fusions, and that further cases are needed to better characterize them.",
