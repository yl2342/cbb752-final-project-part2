Introduction

Plant synthetic biology has made substantial contribution to sustainable applications for biofuel, pharmaceutical production, and food production using plant cellular systems (Yang

et al

.,

2022a

). The current economic success of synthetic biological products calls for more effective techniques and plant platforms to be applied in industry settings (Clarke and Kitney,

2020

; Fausther‐Bovendo and Kobinger,

2021

; Mahmood

et al

.,

2020

). To date, various synthetic biology innovations have been applied to biosensors, crop development, and synthetic bioproducts using various plant resources. For these techniques, the design of synthetic promoters is an attractive approach for targeted gene expression in plants (Ali and Kim,

2019

; Kumar

et al

.,

2020

; Yasmeen

et al

.,

2023

).

Native promoters cover many different CREs spanning hundreds of DNA sequences, which cause unnecessary complexity in targeted gene expression by recruiting superfluous transcription factors to overlap narrow DNA fragments in response to stress or developmental cues (Ali and Kim,

2019

; Yasmeen

et al

.,

2023

). However, in synthetic promoters, the small number of specific CREs without non‐essential elements allows researchers to off‐target binding of transcription factors and focus on valuable responses, leading to more practical applications. In a number of recent studies, synthetic promoters have been applied to effectively manage gene editing, transgenic crop improvement, and orthogonal biosensor construction (Moreno‐Gimenez

et al

.,

2022

; Oliva

et al

.,

2019

; Persad

et al

.,

2020

; Persad‐Russell

et al

.,

2022

).

Synthetic promoters are constructed with a transcription factor (TF) that recognizes a sequence containing either a re‐formatted CREs or simple repeats of a conserved CRE sequence, as well as a core promoter sequence including the binding site of RNA polymerase II. This format has been employed repeatedly for applications in herbaceous and woody plant species (Cai

et al

.,

2020

; Sears

et al

.,

2023

; Sultana

et al

.,

2022

; Yang

et al

.,

2021

,

2022b

). Short synthetic promoters composed of head‐to‐tail repeats of conserved CREs and fused upstream of a − 46 bp 35S promoter can result in a shorter than 100 bp and functional promoter. For example, Sultana

et al

. (

2022

) demonstrated that the synthetic promoters were induced specifically by soybean cyst nematode application in engineered soybean roots (Liu

et al

.,

2014

). In each of these studies, 6–7 copies of short conserved sequences were effective to induce gene expression to specific stimuli.

Synthetic promoters can be used to regulate precise spatiotemporal gene expression at specific developmental stages and tissues/organs. For this purpose, useful CREs must be identified from native promoters in specific tissue/organ at desired plant developmental stages. To date, tissue‐specific native promoters have been reported in various tissues of different species. For example, two different vascular‐tissue‐specific native promoters were identified in switchgrass and

Arabidopsis

(Xu

et al

.,

2018

; Zhang

et al

.,

2014

). A switchgrass vascular‐tissue‐specific promoter (PvPfn2) of 1715 bp and its various 5′‐end deleted fragment showed vasculature specificity in leaves, sheaths, stems, and flowers of heterologous transgenic rice (Xu

et al

.,

2018

). The native promoter of

Arabidopsis thaliana

heat shock protein‐related protein (AtHSPR) was also shown to positively induce a GFP reporter gene in vascular tissues of transgenic

Arabidopsis

(Zhang

et al

.,

2014

). Additionally, promoters of 37 vascular specific expressed genes, including

AtHSPR

, employed several CRE motifs that responded to phytohormones, light, and other biotic and abiotic stimuli, demonstrating their tissue specificity (Zhang

et al

.,

2014

). In addition, three native switchgrass promoters induced GUS marker gene expression in the above‐ground organs of transgenic rice (Liu

et al

.,

2018

). Those promoters responded to several photosystem‐related proteins in the same regions of transgenic switchgrass by fusing with switchgrass MYB4 (Liu

et al

.,

2018

). So far, a number of representative tissue‐ or organ‐specific native promoters have been reported: root‐specific promoters including tomato SIREO and rice RCc3 (Jones

et al

.,

2008

; Xu

et al

.,

1995

), the phloem‐specific promoter of

Brassica juncea

(Koramutla

et al

.,

2016

), seed‐specific promoters rice glutelin (Wu

et al

.,

2000

), sesame 2S albumin (Bhunia

et al

.,

2014

), corn zein (Joshi

et al

.,

2015

), and bean arcelin (De Jaeger

et al

.,

2002

), and trichome tissue‐specific promoters in mint (Ahkami

et al

.,

2015

; Vining

et al

.,

2017

). A developing xylem (DX) tissue‐specific native promoter was cloned from

Pinus densiflora

, which was used to enhance plant biomass and produce biofuel precursors (Cho

et al

.,

2019

; Ko

et al

.,

2012

).

The majority of synthetic tissue‐specific promoters have been designed for use in herbaceous plants. For instance, three synthetic promoters were designed to have root‐specific drought inducible activity in transgenic

Arabidopsis

(Jameel

et al

.,

2020

). These promoters were developed by combinations of 11 well‐known motifs identified from 63 promoters of soybean drought‐inducible genes. A minimal −46 to +1 CaMV 35S core promoter was fused with combinations of CREs (Jameel

et al

.,

2020

). Additionally, four bidirectional tissue‐specific synthetic promoters were shown to be active in green tissues of leaves, sheathes, panicles, and stems of transgenic rice (Bai

et al

.,

2020

). Synthetic DNA fragments containing different types of CREs in rice P

D540

showed various patterns of suppression or activation on gene expression in leaves, roots, young panicles and stems, depending on the selection of CREs, indicating that tissue‐specificity may be tuned in rationally designed, tissue‐specific promoters (Cai

et al

.,

2007

). Recently, additional green‐tissue‐ (Wang

et al

.,

2015

), stem‐ (De Meester

et al

.,

2018

), bidirectional vascular‐ (Lv

et al

.,

2009

), and root‐specific (Mohan

et al

.,

2017

) synthetic promoters have also been developed. In woody plants, native tissue‐specific promoters for induction of downstream gene expression in different organs and tissues have also been reported (Ko

et al

.,

2012

; Li

et al

.,

2018

). With recent advancements in plant single cell biology and synthetic biology (Plant Cell Atlas

et al

.,

2021

; Thibivilliers and Libault,

2021

; Yang and Reyna‐Llorens,

2023

), we can expect the development of robust synthetic tissue and cell type‐specific promoters in plants. Poplar stress responsive synthetic promoters have previously been designed from stress inducible promoters using open‐source RNA‐seq results of whole poplar tissues (Yang

et al

.,

2022b

). However, these promoters did not show tissue specificity under water‐deficit or high salinity treatment. By combining these methods with cell type‐specific RNA‐seq techniques, it is possible to generate advanced tissue specific and cell type‐specific promoters.

The goal of this study was to expand the toolbox of poplar tissue‐specific and water‐deficit stress inducible synthetic promoters by leveraging cell type‐specific (leaf palisade mesophyll and vascular bundle cells) RNA‐seq data. Synthetic promoters containing hexamerized conserved DNA sequences of 20 bases were developed from promoters of differentially expressed genes in two major leaf cell types (palisade‐mesophyll and vascular cells) under water‐deficit stress conditions. Syn3 (20 bp core sequence) and its two derivatives (10 bp 5′ or 3′ of Syn3) were screened for tissue/organ‐specificity in transgenic poplar under water‐deficit stress.

Experimental procedures

Plants growth and water‐deficit and salt stress treatment

Populus tremula × Populus alba

INRA 717 1B4 clones (717‐1B4) were propagated in solidified rooting media (RM: 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, 0.5 g/L MES, 30 g/L sucrose, 5 g/L activated charcoal, 3 g/L Phytoagar, 1 g/L Gelzan, and 0.1 mg/L IBA) in Magenta GA7 boxes (Bioworld, Dublin, OH, USA). The clones were grown in a growth chamber (Percival, Perry, IA, USA) under 16/8 h light/dark conditions at 25 °C with 150 μmol/m

2

s irradiance. Two‐month‐old root regenerated plants were transferred to ProMix BK25 soil (Premier Tech, Quakertown, PA, USA) in 1 L pots in the trays covered with lid. After acclimation for 2 weeks, lids were opened in the same chamber condition. Trees were watered every 2 days and fertilized with a 14‐14‐14 nutrient (Seed World, Odessa, FL, USA) solution once a month.

Nicotiana benthamiana

seeds were stratified at 4

°

C for 4 days in sterile water without light. The seeds were germinated and grown on ProMixBK25 potting mix in 8.9 cm square pots.

N. benthamiana

was grown under 16/8 h light/dark at 25

°

C with 150 μmol/m

2

s light intensity. Plants were watered at three‐day intervals.

To generate water‐deficit conditions, 3‐month established poplar plants in pots or 4 week‐old

N. benthamiana

were withheld from watering until leaf‐wilting was observed in growth chamber conditions.

Salt treatments were applied via watering with 250 mM NaCl every other day. Mock controls of plants were watered normally.

For cell type‐specific RNA‐seq analysis, water deficit treatments were applied 45 days after rooting, by withholding water until visual stress symptoms (i.e., leaf wilting) appeared (30%–35% relative soil water content) (early water deficit, EWD). Plants were kept for 10 days at 35% soil water content (late water deficit, LWD) and then re‐watered with regular fertilization for 3 days after sampling for the recovery period (REC). Leaf samples from each treatment were collected between 9 am and 10 am (1.30–2.30 h after the lights were turned on).

Cryosectioning and laser capture microdissection (

LCM

) for leaf cell types isolation

Leaf samples were harvested close to the midvein region comprising both palisade and vascular cell types. The leaf samples were directly embedded in cryomold filled with OCT

®

embedding polymer (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) and the blocks were frozen using liquid nitrogen. These blocks were used for cryosection process using CryoStar

TM

NX70 cryostat that generated 12 μm cross sections of leaf tissue. The obtained cryosections were placed on PEN membrane glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and washed using ice cold 70% ethanol for 2 min, 85% ethanol for 1 min, and 100% ethanol for 1 min. The slides were dried and used for the LCM procedure described previously (Balasubramanian

et al

.,

2021

). Approximately 500–1000 mesophyll palisade cells and about 1000–2000 vascular cells were collected for transcriptome analysis (Figure

S1

).

RNA

‐seq and data analysis

RNA isolation and full‐length cDNA generation were performed from LCM isolated cell clusters using SMART‐Seq

®

v4 plus kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA). The cDNA quality was determined by 5200 Agilent Fragment analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Single‐read sequencing with a read length of 150 was performed by NextSeq 500 sequencing system using NextSeq 500/550 high output reagent kit v2.5 (150 cycles) (Illumina, San Diego, CA). With the generated RNA‐seq reads, initial Quality control was performed using FastQC (Andrews,

2010

). Read trimming was performed using BBduk script integrated in BBmap (Bushnell,

2014

). Reads were aligned to the

Populus trichocarpa

v3.0 genome (

https://phytozome‐next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Ptrichocarpa_v3_0

), using Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg,

2012

). Aligned reads mapped to genome features were counted using htseq‐count function in HTSeq 2.0 (Putri

et al

.,

2022

). Differential expression gene (DEG) analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love

et al

.,

2014

).

DNA

motif analysis for selection of water‐deficit responsive and tissue‐specific synthetic promoter generation

Promoter sequences for DNA motif analysis were profiled from BioMart integrated in Phytozome (v12.1.6;

www.phytozome.org

) (Goodstein

et al

.,

2012

; Smedley

et al

.,

2015

). Two kilobase (kb) upstream sequence from each promoter's ATG initial codon was curated from the

P. trichocarpa

v 4.0 genome annotation. The sequences were submitted to the command line application of MEME (v5.5.3) (Bailey

et al

.,

2015

) to find conserved DNA motifs of 20 bases in length. We submitted conserved DNA motifs to the PLACE database of plant

cis

‐acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE,

https://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/

) with default setting by host web site (Higo

et al

.,

1999

).

Single stranded oligonucleotides composed of 6 repeats of a conserved DNA motif were commercially synthesized for synthetic promoter generation (Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA; Table

S1

). Double stranded DNA fragments were generated by reannealing two complementary single‐stranded oligonucleotides as described in our previous study (Yang

et al

.,

2021

). These double strand DNA fragments were fused with the −46 to +1 CaMV 35S core promoter (47 bp) together with TMV 5′Ω ‐ leader sequence (63 bp; Table

S2

). Turbo green fluorescence protein (GFP) or β‐glucuronidase (GUS) coding sequences were placed downstream of the synthetic promoter as a reporter coding gene. Turbo red fluorescence protein (RFP) or luciferase (LUC) genes driven by 2 × CaMV 35S short promoter (Table

S2

) were included in the T‐DNA as a transformation control. Binary vectors for transient and stable transgenic transformation were generated by Golden Gate cloning using MoClo parts (Engler

et al

.,

2014

; Werner

et al

.,

2012

). Synthetic DNA motifs were inserted into backbone plasmids by Bsa I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) digestion followed by T7 ligase (New England Biolabs) ligation.

Transient transformation for synthetic promoter activity assay

Poplar mesophyll protoplast preparation, protoplast transformation, and image analysis were performed as described by Yang

et al

. (

2021

,

2023

). For transient protoplast transformation and agroinfiltration assays in

N. benthamiana

leaves, the binary gene constructs incorporating the synthetic promoters fused with GFP were used (Figure

2c

).

Agrobacterium

transformation, agroinfiltration of 1‐month‐old

N. benthamiana

leaves, water cessation, and subsequent fluorescence measurements were performed as previously described (Sparkes

et al

.,

2006

; Yang

et al

.,

2021

).

Fluorescent images of GFP and RFP expressed in poplar mesophyll protoplast were taken by EVOS M7000 image analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fluorescence intensity of leaves was measured using a Fluorolog

®

‐3 (HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan) fluorescence spectrophotometer using direct scans on the abaxial side of intact leaves.

Agrobacterium

‐mediated poplar leaf disk transformation with binary plasmids containing a

GUS

driven by various synthetic promoters

LUC coding sequence, in place of RFP, was driven by the CaMV 2 × 35S promoter, while the

uid

A GUS gene replaced GFP and was driven by one of the designed synthetic promoters (Yang

et al

.,

2022b

). Synthetic DNA motif digestion and ligation was performed as described above. See Figure

4

for plasmid illustrations.

The binary gene constructs were transfected into

Agrobacterium

(EHA105) via the freeze–thaw method using liquid nitrogen (Hofgen and Willmitzer,

1988

). The protocol and reagent chemical composition for

Agrobacterium

‐mediated poplar transformation were optimized with leaf disks from previously published methods (Song

et al

.,

2006

). Leaf disks were cut from 2‐month‐old poplar plants that were grown in RM in Magenta GA7 boxes. Leaf disks were pre‐cultured for 2 days in the dark on callus‐induction media (CIM: 1 × MS, 30 g/L sucrose, 0.25 g/L MES, 0.1 g/L myo‐inositol, 1 × vitamin solution, 1 μM NAA, 3 g/L Phytoagar, 1 g/L Gelzan) plates without any antibiotics before dipping in

Agrobacterium

solution that had been cultured overnight in 5 mL of LB (pH 5.4; Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 25 μg/mL rifampin (Sigma‐Aldrich), and 20 μM acetosyringone (Sigma‐Aldrich) at 28 °C with shaking (200–250 rpm). Leaf segments were then incubated for 3 days in the dark. Co‐cultured leaf disks were washed three times in sterile water and then shaken in 40 mL of sterile water including 300 mg/mL of cefotaxime (Sigma‐Aldrich) and 300 mg/mL of timentin (Plantmedia, Dublin, OH, USA) for 1 h. Excess liquid surrounding leaf disks was removed on autoclaved Whatman™ 3MM paper (130 mm; Cytiva, MA) and then leaf disks were put on onto a new CIM plate that included hygromycin, cefotaxime, and timentin for selection. Callus induction, shoot regeneration, shoot elongation, and rooting were performed by following the same process as described in a published protocol (Song

et al

.,

2006

).

PCR assays used genomic DNA that was extracted from a leaf of independently regenerated poplar using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). PCR was performed using DreamTaq DNA polymerase master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the reaction sequence as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles repeating 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. Two separate reactions were performed using gene specific primers for LUC and GUS (Table

S3

). PtaUBCc primers were used as an internal control for genomic DNA qualification. Amplification fragments were separated on 1.2% agarose gels running in 1 × TAE.

GUS

staining and fluorescent image analysis

The leaves at the 3rd to 5th position from the apical tip, as well as stem and root tissues, were collected from wilted and well‐watered trees. Stem samples were collected from 10 to 15 cm below the primary shoot apex, and then sliced for GUS staining. Roots were collected directly below the potting mix surface. Mock transgenic control or wild‐type plants were collected in the same manner from well‐watered plants.

GUS staining in collected organs were performed by incubation for 6 h at 37 °C in GUS staining buffer (50 mM Na

The stained tissues were bleached by washing overnight with 70% ethanol. Stained tissue images were taken by Stereomaster dissection microscope (Fisher Scientific).

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (

qPCR

) analysis

Total RNA was extracted via Plant RNA extraction reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA extracts were purified through RNA binding columns using the Spectrum total plant RNA extraction kit (Sigma). Single‐stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription reaction with RevertAid first‐strand cDNA synthesis kit following manufacturer's manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Single stranded cDNAs were two times diluted with nuclease‐free water and subjected into 15 μL of total volume of 1 × PowerUp™ SYBR™ green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with gene‐specific primers for each experiment. Primer sequences are listed in Table

S1

. The qPCR profile was 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The relative gene expression change was determined by the 2

−ΔΔ

Ct

equation (Livak and Schmittgen,

2001

). Non‐detected Ct values in qPCR such as GUS and LUC gene detections in wild‐type samples' organs were replaced with a Ct value of 36 for calculation of estimated relative fold change compared to samples with detectable Ct values.

Results

Identification of leaf tissue specific water deficit stress‐induced genes from cell type‐specific

RNA

‐seq analysis

To develop tissue‐specific and water‐deficit stress‐induced synthetic promoters, it was necessary to identify the native promoter sequences of cell type‐specific and water‐deficit stress upregulated genes. For this process, stress‐induced cell type‐specific genes (palisade mesophyll and vascular cell type) were identified through low‐input transcriptomic analysis of the cell clusters collected by LCM from the leaves of 717‐1B4 hybrid poplar under water‐deficit stress. Herein, a total of 117 genes were detected to have higher relative expression (defined as a significant fold change of gene expression compared to the same tissue of mock control >4 and adjustive

P

value <0.05) either in leaf palisade or in vascular cell types of water‐deficit‐stressed leaves of

P. tremula

×

P. alba

(717‐1B4) hybrid poplar under EWD, LWD, and REC conditions (Table

S4

). Ninety‐eight of these genes were induced significantly in leaf palisade cells, while 16 genes were significantly induced in vascular cells (Data

S1

and

S2

). To establish coinciding gene expression in other organs and confirm leaf‐specificity, we selected three genes that were highly expressed in leaf palisade cells (

PtXaAlbH.02G059400

,

PtXaAlbH.13G089600

, and

PtXaAlbH.03G050900

) and another three genes which were highly expressed in leaf vascular cells (

PtXaAlbH.01G318500

,

PtXaAlbH.05G059900

, and

PtXaAlbH.09G114000

). Gene identity (ID) of

P. trichocarpa

homologues and their functional annotation are listed in Figure

1a

. 717‐1B4 gene‐specific primers were used for qPCR analysis in leaf, stem, and root of water‐deficit‐stressed poplar (Figure

S2

).

PtXaAlbH.10G054500

(PtaExtensin) was used as a marker gene to determine water‐deficit conditions. When expression of this gene was increased, a plant was assessed to be sufficiently drought‐stressed (Figure

1b

) (Dash

et al

.,

2018

). In the selected palisade‐expressed genes,

PtXaAlbH.02G059400

and

PtXaAlbH.13G089600

had higher expression in treated leaves and stems compared with those in mock plants (Figure

1b

). Interestingly, the expression neither of these genes remained unchanged in roots under water cessation treatments.

Among the three selected genes displaying high expression in leaf vascular cells,

PtXaAlbH.01G318500

showed high expression in both roots and stems. However,

PtXaAlbH.05G059900

expression was increased during water deficit stress in leaves, stems, and roots (Figure

1b

). Most of all, the relative fold changes (FCs) of the expression of both genes were increased by water‐deficit conditions compared to the selected genes expressed in palisade cells.

Taken together, four of the selected genes of

PtXaAlbH.02G059400

,

PtXaAlbH.13G089600

,

PtXaAlbH.01G318500

, and

PtXaAlbH.05G059900

were significantly expressed in either leaves or stems during water‐deficit stress. However, the gene expression of

PtXaAlbH.02G059400

and

PtXaAlbH.13G089600

was not affected in root tissue by water‐deficit stress. These data confirmed that most of the genes selected based on our transcriptomic analysis were expressed in the green tissues under water‐deficit stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that the promoters of these genes comprise CREs that were specific to green tissues and were induced by water‐deficit stress.

Predicting and screening basic

DNA

sequences to design synthetic promoters by transient protoplast transformation

We showed previously that the synthetic promoter format using head‐to‐tail repeats of single CRE motifs is effective to induce marker gene expressions in both transient assays and in stable transgenic plants upon induction by stimuli such as high‐salt or water‐deficit treatments (Yang

et al

.,

2021

,

2022b

). To generate rationally designed synthetic promoters with tissue/organ specificity together with water‐stress induction, we utilized the same process as our previous studies to identify DNA motifs of interest as sequence to be repeated in synthetic promoters for poplar. Two kilobase upstream sequences from the ATG initiation codon of co‐expressed genes in leaf palisade (98 genes) or vascular tissues (16 genes) were submitted separately to predict well‐conserved DNA motifs (Table

S4

). A total of eight conserved sequences of 20 bases in length were predicted with high significance after removal of TATA boxes or single sequence repeats from both analyses (

E

; Figure

). The potential CREs for each was predicted by PLACE and listed in Table

Among eight conserved 20 base sequences, we selected the four sequences with the highest

E‐

values to generate synthetic promoters by 6 repetitions of these sequences (total of 120 bp in length) without any spacing or other factors inserted (Figure

2b

). When the plasmid constructs (Figure

2c

) were transformed into poplar mesophyll protoplasts in 0.5 M mannitol incubation buffer, all transformed protoplasts displayed RFP fluorescence expression, indicating that the protoplast transformation was successful (Figure

2d

). However, GFP expression in transformed protoplasts was observed only with Syn2 and Syn3 promoters. Since Syn3 induction was observed in relatively more protoplasts, Syn3 was selected as a template sequence to build a series of synthetic promoters for subsequent analyses.

N. Benthamiana

leaves

New shorter promoter versions were synthesized from the Syn3 sequence since it had the highest activity among the tested 120 bp promoters. Six repeats of the 5′ Syn3 sequence (6 × 10 bp; Syn3‐10b‐1) as well as the Syn3 3′ sequence (6 × 10 bp; Syn3‐10b‐2) were used to replace the full‐length sequences of Syn3 in the binary vector used in protoplast transformation (Figure

3a,b

). Syn3‐10b‐1 had no functional CREs reported while Syn3‐10b‐2 had GGGCC, which has a predicted function for light‐induction (Table

1

; Figure

3a

red box). Since Syn3‐10b‐1 and − 2 were derived from Syn3, the 120 bp of Syn3 was tested along with the two short promoters to compare activities in agroinfiltrated

N. benthamiana

leaves. All of the infiltrated leaves including a vector without any synthetic promoter insertion had lower GFP intensities in mock conditions (Figure

3d

). RFP fluorescence was detected in a similar range of fluorescence in all transient transformed leaves, showing that agroinfiltration was successful. The wilted infiltrated leaves resulting from 5‐day water cessation treatment, that begun 2 days after infiltration, displayed 2‐ to 3‐fold higher GFP fluorescence in Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3 than in mock conditions. However, Syn3‐10b‐2 had very low GFP intensity similar to vector transformed plants under water‐deficit stress (Figure

3d

). Interestingly, salt‐treatments (250 mM NaCl) did not alter GFP expression (Figure

3d

). Thus, we concluded thatSyn3 and Syn3‐10b‐1 promoters were significantly and specifically induced in response to water‐deficit stress.

stressed by high salt treatment or water cessation. Note that all transformations were performed successfully based on RFP expression, and GFP was induced only in water‐deficit leaves of Syn3 and Syn3‐10b‐1. None of the tested synthetic promoters responded to salt stress. Statistical significance of gene expression between mock and water‐cessation conditions was determined by

t

‐tests (*

P

< 0.05).

Although Syn3‐10b‐1 had only half the length of the entire Syn3 sequence, GFP expression was similar between the two promoter constructs (Figure

3d

). Given that the 3′ sequence (Syn3‐10b‐2) did not appear to be water stress‐induced, we concluded that the critical CRE for water‐stress induction was in the Syn3‐10b‐1 sequence. Noteworthy, although Syn3‐10b‐2 contained the predicted CRE, GGGCC, for green tissue expression (Table

1

, Figure

3a

red box), this promoter had apparently the lowest expression in mock and water‐deficit treated agroinfiltrated leaves (Figure

3d

).

GUS

induction in the stable transgenic poplar containing Syn3‐10b‐1 (

) in water‐deficit conditions

Based on the transient transformation assays, we observed that Syn3 and Syn‐10b‐1 have water‐ deficit‐specific inducibility in leaves (Figures

2d

and

3d

). To assess whether the synthetic promoters respond to water‐deficit conditions with tissue/organ specificity

in planta

, we engineered poplar with synthetic constructs in which GUS was the induced reporter gene and LUC was the internal control reporter gene under the control of the 35S promoter (Figure

4

). PCR analyses showed that most transgenic events contained both GUS and LUC (Figure

S3

). These events were used in subsequent experiments. No phenotypical differences were seen in regenerated transgenic poplar plants during the 3 months from transplanting into potting mix before water deficit treatment (Figure

S2

).

Figure 4

Binary vector construct containing GUS gene driven by synthetic promoter introduced in transgenic poplar. Binary vectors contained a series of synthetic DNA motifs (Syn3, Syn3‐10b‐1, and Syn3‐10b‐2), sequences of which were listed in Figure

3b

. Synthetic DNA motifs fused with minimal CaMV 35S core promoter and TMV 5′Ω − leader sequence for assistance of GUS expression. Vectors also contained 2 × short 35S driven LUC cassette as an internal control for monitoring transformation efficiency in transgenic trees.

We measured Syn3‐10b‐1's inducibility to water‐deficit stress by GUS staining when leaves were wilted after water cessation (~5 days without watering) using well‐watered plants as controls. GUS expression resulted in a faint blue colouring on the leaf surface even in mock samples (Figure

5a

). Stem slices had slightly darker blue GUS staining at the primary phloem region including the vascular cambium layer on the outside of stem sections. However, GUS‐stained cells were not visibly detected in any root samples of all three different transgenic lines, indicating that GUS expression driven by Syn3‐10b‐1 was slightly activated under non‐stress conditions in green tissues but not in root tissues. After water cessation treatment, leaves and stems of wilted transgenic poplars had stronger and more extensive blue staining than mock (Figure

5a

). Interestingly, the pith including primary xylem and vascular phloem had the darkest staining as compared to other organs. Based on these observations, the Syn3‐10b‐1 synthetic promoter was deemed to be highly activated in leaf and stem tissues under water‐deficit conditions.

To validate Syn3‐10b‐1's positive induction of GUS gene expression as a response to water‐deficit conditions, GUS transcript abundances were compared in three organs of leaf‐wilted transgenic poplar versus mock controlled plants. As a transformation control, LUC genes were detected in a range from 30‐ to 600‐fold relative changes in all transgenic lines whereas wild‐type poplar did not show any LUC gene expression (Figure

5b

). Water‐deficit stress did not induce more LUC expression in any of the assessed tissues. Meanwhile, GUS transcript abundance was increased in leaf and stem tissues under water‐deficit conditions. In leaf samples, GUS was expressed from 4‐ to 8‐fold higher than mock in all transgenic poplar. The stems of three water‐deficit transgenic plants had about 3‐fold higher GUS transcript than mock controls. However, GUS gene expressions were not increased in water deficit roots. GUS gene expression was minimally detected in all organs of mock samples, suggesting that Syn3‐10b‐1 may not solely respond in leaf and stem tissues. However, GUS expression was more significantly induced in green tissues/organs than roots under water‐deficit stress (Figure

5b

). These observations were in agreement with GUS staining results (Figure

5a

).

Two lines containing the Syn3‐10b‐2 promoter sequence had no visible GUS expression, but Syn3‐10‐b‐2#3 showed weak GUS staining. Nonetheless, there was no apparent water‐stress induction in any events (Figure

6a

).

GUS gene transcripts were quantified in leaf, stem, and root samples, but the levels were about 25‐fold less than in Syn3‐10b‐1 (Figure

6b

). Additionally, water cessation did not affect GUS gene expression in any tissues. The consistent LUC gene expression showed that the transgenes were introduced and functioning properly in transgenic poplar. However, the lack of increase in GUS expression confirmed that the lack of water‐deficit stress inducibility of Syn3‐10b‐2.

GUS

gene expression in stable transgenic poplar containing Syn3 (

Syn3

) under water deficit conditions

The two short synthetic promoters, Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3‐10b‐2, responded differently to water‐deficit stress in transgenic poplar, even though they were both derived from the basic Syn3 sequence. To further explore this phenomenon, we tested the hexamerized 20‐base Syn3 sequence in a synthetic promoter in transgenic poplar. In the mock treatment, three randomly selected transgenic poplar events had GUS expression in most parts of the leaf unlike Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3‐10b‐2 (Figure

7a

). GUS staining was also observed in vascular cambium and primary phloem regions as well as in primary xylem and pith of Syn3 stems. Unlike Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3‐10b‐2, the root tips of two transgenic lines also had GUS expression. However, GUS stain detection in green tissues appeared to be less than in mock. Consistent GUS staining in different organs was confirmed by comparing GUS transcript abundance between mock and water‐deficit stress conditions (Figure

7b

). The GUS transcripts were detected in all Syn3 transgenic lines; however, no significant of GUS gene increase was observed in water‐deficit stressed tissues compared to mock.

(a) X‐gluc staining of leaf, stem, and root tissues of transgenic plants with or without water‐deficit stress.

Chlorophyll was bleached by overnight shaking in 70% ethanol (bar = 1 cm). (b) GUS gene induction in water‐ deficit stressed Syn3‐10b‐1 transgenic poplars. Total RNA was extracted from root, leaf, and stem tissues of water deficit transgenic poplar growing in soil. PtaUBCc was used as internal control for normalization.

Bar displays mean ± SD (

Thus, Syn3 appears to be a green‐tissue active promoter with approximately a 10‐to‐12 fold less activity in roots compared with leaves of transgenic poplar. The Syn3 was not induced by water‐deficit stress treatment. It is a moderately strong promoter in leaves compared to Syn3‐10b‐1.

Discussion

Synthetic promoters are useful to spatiotemporally tune transgene expression in plants. In this study, we designed a synthetic promoter that has green‐tissue specific activity with water‐deficit stress inducibility as well as another quasi‐constitutive synthetic promoter. These synthetic promoters are apt additions to the transgenic poplar toolbox. These promoters were constructed by six repeats of a head‐to‐tail array of conserved sequences found in the collection of 2 kb native promoters whose downstream genes were highly induced in leaf tissues under water‐deficit treatment, based on LCM‐based cell type‐specific transcriptome analysis (Figures

2

and

3

). Two green‐tissue‐specific inducible promoters, Syn3 and Syn3‐10b‐1, induced the downstream GUS gene in stable transgenic hybrid poplars (Figures

5

and

7

). Interestingly, Syn3‐10b‐1 responded to water‐deficit stress in stable transgenic poplar while Syn3 did not, despite containing the sequence of Syn3‐10b‐1 within its larger sequence. Furthermore, the Syn3‐10b‐2 synthetic promoter based on the 3′ sequence of Syn3 did not induce reliable tissue‐specificity or stress responsiveness (Figure

6

). Additionally, the sequence of Syn3‐10b‐2 did not improve or repress Syn3‐10b‐1 positive activity in Syn3 (Figure

7

). To summarize, the 5′ sequence in Syn3 seems to function predominantly for tissue‐specificity and water‐deficit stress in transgenic poplar, whereas the 3′ sequence has no notable response and may even inhibit water deficit response when included in the synthetic promoter sequence (Figures

3

and

5

,

6

,

7

). It is evident that synthetic promoter design is still reliant on empirical testing since CREs cannot be validated solely by

in silico

analysis. However, more precise experiments with synthetic promoter constructs containing mutant sequence of present synthetic promoters should also be required to clarify tissue specificity and water‐deficit stress responsibility of present synthetic promoters in future.

The traditional architecture of synthetic promoters is consisted of the three parts: (1) the proximal sequence, which is recognized by TFs, (2) a core promoter which binds RNA polymerase, and (3) distal enhancer or repressor sequences to modify transcriptional initiation (Dey

et al

.,

2015

). Among these components, the proximal sequences‐composed of CREs or a DNA fragment based on a reliable native promoter‐can play a pivotal part in deciding the synthetic promoter's properties and activity. Recent reviews have noted current achievements using well‐known CREs in traditional synthetic promoter constructs in various plant species (Ali and Kim,

2019

; Yasmeen

et al

.,

2023

). The synthetic promoter structure utilizing repeats of a known CRE fused with a minimal core promoter is a rational design that usually functions as designed. To date, our colleagues have facilitated in tandem repeats of well‐known CREs fused with a short −46 CaMV 35S core promoter to produce biotic and abiotic stress‐responsible phytosensors in

Arabidopsis

, soybean, potato, and poplar (Liu

et al

.,

2014

; Persad‐Russell

et al

.,

2022

; Sears

et al

.,

2023

; Sultana

et al

.,

2022

;Yang

et al

.,

2021

,

2022b

). Among these studies, pathogen‐ and radiation‐sensing synthetic promoters were developed from copies of the well‐known CREs of the S‐box pathogen sensing DNA motif and the DNA recognition motif in the

Arabidopsis

RAD51 promoter, following the traditional process for synthetic promoter generation (Persad‐Russell

et al

.,

2022

; Sears

et al

.,

2023

).

To identify new CREs, we and our colleagues have been attempting to find unknown DNA motifs by computational analysis for novel synthetic promoter construction. To do so, DNA motifs are derived from conserved DNA sequences in native promoters of co‐expressed genes of interest in species of interest: typically, non‐model plants. Recently, several tandem repeats with unknown DNA motifs have been successfully introduced in transgenic soybean and poplar, and clearly induced downstream genes relating to nematode infection in soybean (Liu

et al

.,

2014

; Sultana

et al

.,

2022

) and abiotic stresses in poplar (Yang

et al

.,

2021

,

2022b

) from transcriptome analysis including naïve microarray analysis. Although these synthetic promoters were activated in transgenic plants by abiotic or biotic stimuli, the responses were not specific to cell types or tissue. The present study more precisely predicted novel DNA motifs from cell type‐specific RNA‐seq data. Promoter responsiveness was dependent on sequence selection and formation for water‐stress response together with tissue/organ specificity, which allows more specific regulation via synthetic promoters than previous achievements.

Notably, Syn3‐10b‐2 had a CRE motif for light inducibility (GGGCC) in its basic sequence, but it did not endow discernible expression in transiently transformed

N. benthamiana

and stable transformed poplar under water‐deficit stress (Figures

2

and

6

). Since GGGCC is detected commonly in the most promoter of genes, no response of Syn3‐10b‐2 in transgenic poplar should be predicted. On the other hand, although no CREs were predicted in the basic sequence of Syn3‐10b‐1, this synthetic promoter had a water‐deficit stress response with specificity for green tissues (Figures

2

and

5

). These results indicate that genome‐wide databases of CREs are still lacking complete CRE information, and further studies will need to functionally test well‐known CREs as well as unknown DNA motifs to develop the most reliable synthetic promoters for non‐model plants. Elucidating conserved DNA sequences based on longer promoter sequences may be a good alternative to identify optimal CRE information, as performed in this study. A number of recent successes in high‐throughput techniques have given critical information about CRE sequences that bind TFs in diverse plant developmental stages and environmental responses (Marand

et al

.,

2023

; Schmitz

et al

.,

2022

; Yasmeen

et al

.,

2023

). Rapid identification of genome‐wide TF binding DNA motifs could be performed generally by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP‐seq) (Lihu and Holban,

2016

). Recently, more high‐throughput techniques along with various TF capturing methods such as high‐throughput sequencing‐fluorescent ligand interaction profiling (HiTS‐FLIP), ATAC‐seq with nuclei sorting, DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP‐seq), and crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP‐seq) have been used to get the information of genome‐wide DNA binding motifs for single TFs (Bartlett

et al

.,

2017

; Chen

et al

.,

2008

; Liu

et al

.,

2002

; Lu

et al

.,

2017

; Nutiu

et al

.,

2011

). With increasing information of CREs via high throughput techniques, more feasible and reliable designs of synthetic promoters can be made possible.

The spacing between CRE copies and the proximity of CRE copies relative to the core promoter are also known to be important factors affecting synthetic promoter activity (Yasmeen

et al

.,

2023

). In a previous study, 6 copies of 7‐bp of ABRE were spaced with a 23 bp flanking sequence, which affected synthetic promoter activity (Wu

et al

.,

2018

). Additionally, stress‐inducible synthetic promoters in poplar, including SD9 (20 bp of a basic sequence) and its shorter derivative (7–8 bp) repeats of SD9‐1, SD9‐2, and SD9‐3 showed different responsiveness in individual transgenic poplar events against environmental stresses (Yang

et al

.,

2022b

). In the current study, the Syn3 basic sequence (20 bp) was used to construct 6 repeats of Syn3‐10b‐1 (10 bp) and Syn3‐10b‐2 (10 bp), of which the former had positive activity in transgenic poplar and the latter did not (Figures

5

and

6

). That is, Syn3 was constructed with 6 repeats of a positively active DNA fragment (Syn3‐10b‐1) spaced by a non‐functional fragment (Syn3‐10b‐2) (Figure

4

). Interestingly, Syn3 was highly active in leaves and to a lesser degree in stems and roots under non‐stress conditions while Syn3‐10b‐1 was not (Figures

5

and

7

). In addition, the regulatory activity of Syn3 was not stimulated by water‐cessation. Meanwhile, Syn3‐10b‐1 was shown to highly induce visible GUS expression and GUS gene transcription under water‐deficit conditions with tissue‐specificity in leaf and stem, but not root tissues (Figure

5

). Therefore, it seems to be apparent that the spacing between Syn3‐10b‐1 fragments by insertion of Syn3‐10b‐2 led to higher constitutive activity, which is congruent to the observation by Wu

et al

. (

2018

) with ABRE repeats. However, in terms of water‐deficit inducibility, Syn3‐10b‐1 had a more precise activity than either Syn3 or Syn3‐10b‐2. Therefore, spacing requirements of DNA motifs or CRE repeats may be dependent on specific applications. Additionally, the distance between DNA motif repeats with a minimal core promoter is also an important factor for reliable synthetic promoter activity. The studies investigating insertions between the core promoter including the TATA box and CRE array showed that a distance over 50 bp between two factors significantly reduced the promoter activity (Cai

et al

.,

2020

). Our current synthetic promoters have 4 bp distance between DNA motif repeats and the core promoter, which may be too proximal, and could potentially prevent optimal TF recruitment for transcription. The present results have shown positive synthetic promoter activity, but we may be able to further optimize the activity and specificity via spacing and CRE repeat number as well optimizing proximity between repeats and the core promoter. Furthermore, the present study did not determine if these synthetic promoters can be tuned accurately to different levels of water stress. In order to create optimal designs for synthetic biology applications, it will be necessary to experimentally quantify the exact correlation between current synthetic promoters and their environmental stress cues, including water deficit and salt stresses in future.

The GUS induction driven by Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3 was enriched in leaf and stem tissues compared to roots (Figures

5

and

7

). In application, cell walls in the vascular cambium and xylem are important for bioenergy and bioproduct synthesis. As a practical example of synthetic promoter application for sustainable biomass increase, three copies of a secondary wall NAC binding element (SNBE) of 103 bp in length induced cinnamoyl‐coenzyme A reductase 1 (CCR1) specifically in vessel tissue by utilizing a 35S core promoter in transgenic

Arabidopsis

(De Meester

et al

.,

2018

). The CCR1‐specific induction in stem vascular tissue driven by the SNBE synthetic promoter recovered vascular collapse in a

ccr1

mutant, resulting in a 59% increase of stem biomass compared to wild type. These transgenic

Arabidopsis

had a 4‐fold increase in total sugar yield, which could be useful for applications in biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, SNBE regulated spatiotemporal expression of a CRISPR construct showed reduced CCR1 function in secondary cell wall structures (Yu

et al

.,

2021

). The reduction of CCR1 function in stem tissue resulted in reduction of recalcitrance, which sequentially increased saccharification in transgenic plants. The stem‐tissue‐specific properties of Syn3‐10b‐1 and Syn3 in the present study seem similar to the SNBE synthetic promoter. Therefore, application of these synthetic promoters along with a poplar secondary cell wall biosynthesis related genes could allow manipulation of biomass‐related metabolic pathways at the transcriptional level.

#### SYN3 - Article 2: Syn3, a newly developed cyclic peptide and BDNF signaling enhancer, ameliorates retinal ganglion cell degeneration in diabetic retinopathy
<Date>: 2024-5-14
<PMCID>: 11528515
<Full Text Content>:
Dear Editor,

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults worldwide (

Sabanayagam et al., 2019

). Increasing evidence suggests that visual deficits are closely associated with neurodegeneration, especially the synaptic loss and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (

Kern and Barber, 2008

). Neurotrophic factors play a key role in supporting the survival of RGCs (

Kimura et al., 2016

) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stands out as a crucial neurotrophin vital for RGCs (

Kimura et al., 2016

).

In vivo

studies have demonstrated that intravitreal administration of BDNF enhances the survival of axotomized RGCs in rats, and astrocytes designed to secrete BDNF promote RGC survival

in vitro

Castillo et al., 1994

). The levels of BDNF in both serum and aqueous humor are significantly reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus prior to the onset of clinical signs of retinopathy (

Taslipinar Uzel et al., 2020

). In streptozotocin (STZ)-injected DR rats,

BDNF

mRNA, and protein expression is reduced in retinal tissues (

Seki et al., 2004

) and retinal neuropathy was ameliorated by intraocular administration of BDNF (

Seki et al., 2004

). These findings demonstrate the physiological significance of reduced BDNF signaling in the development of DR and the degeneration of RGCs, suggesting that bolstering BDNF signaling may offer neuroprotection to RGCs in diabetes (

Seki et al., 2004

).

Upon BDNF stimulation, the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor associates with the adaptor proteins Gab1, SHP2, and Grb2, which facilitate the initiation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phospholipase C, and the Ras/MAPK intracellular signaling pathways (

Kimura et al., 2016

). Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) is a synaptic scaffolding protein involved in the trafficking and stabilization of N-methyl-

d

-aspartate receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors at the postsynaptic membrane to regulate glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Marshall et al., 2018

). Our group (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Lau et al., 2023

) and others (

Ji et al., 2005

) identified PSD95 as a TrkB-associated scaffolding protein required for intact downstream PLC and Akt-mTOR signaling (

Cao et al., 2013

).

Intravitreal delivery of BDNF has been shown to mitigate RGC degeneration following optic nerve injury, although its efficacy is limited due to TrkB downregulation (

Fudalej et al., 2021

). Treatment with BDNF is also problematic due to potential toxicities arising from its activation of the p75NTR pathway and the possible truncated TrkB.T1 isoform implicated in retinal degeneration (

Yanpallewar et al., 2012

). In an attempt to circumvent these limitations, we developed a series of peptidomimetic compounds that bind PSD95 to facilitate its association with TrkB and enhance BDNF signaling (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Lau et al., 2023

). One of these compounds CN2097 (R

7

-CC-YK[KTE(β-Ala)]V) consists of a cyclic moiety based on CRIPT, incorporating a β-alanine lactam side chain linker between the valine and threonine residues that binds both the PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains of PSD95 and a poly-arginine (R

7

) blood–brain barrier active-transport moiety (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Lau et al., 2023

). In Angelman syndrome, where BDNF signaling is impaired (

Cao et al., 2013

), CN2097 enhanced BDNF signaling to restore long-term potentiation and mitigate neurological deficits (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Lau et al., 2023

). In this study, we first investigated the efficacy of CN2097 in the treatment of DR. Finding that CN2097 administration potently alleviated RGC degeneration, we next tested the efficacy of a newly developed cyclic peptide, named Syn3, which specifically binds the PDZ3 domain of PSD95 with nanomolar affinity (

Naik et al., 2024

). We found that Syn3 boosts the formation of the TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 complex, and is more potent than CN2097 in providing robust protection for RGCs in DR model mice.

We first assessed the ability of CN2097 to promote BDNF signaling in primary murine RGCs. Pretreatment with CN2097 (2 μmol/L) for twenty minutes significantly enhanced BDNF-induced Akt and S6K phosphorylation (

P

< 0.001 vs. BDNF-only treatment,

Fig. S1A

), without affecting TrkB phosphorylation (

P

> 0.05 vs. BDNF-only treatment,

Fig. S1A

) or the expression of TrkB, Akt1, and S6K (

Fig. S1A

). To determine whether CN2097 protects RGCs

in vivo

, the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DR mouse model was established. CN2097 was intravitreously administered at day 42 and day 56 after the final STZ administration (

Fig. S1B

). In DR mice (10 weeks after the last STZ administration), the number of nuclei in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) was decreased by 45.08% ± 9.54% compared the vehicle-administrated control mice (“Ctrl,”

P

< 0.001, nice mice per group,

Fig. S1C

). Significantly, CN2097 administration ameliorated RGC degeneration in DR mice (12.22 ± 2.59 vs. 22.01 ± 2.80 per view,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. S1C

), quantifying nuclei from Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE)-stained retinal sections. Fluorescence staining of retinal sections confirmed that the number of NeuN-positive RGCs in the GCL was dramatically decreased in the DR mice (47. 8% ± 9.92% compared to Ctrl mice,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. S1D

). CN2097 administration reduced RGC degeneration in DR mice (10.89 ± 2.526 vs. 15.56 ± 3.88 per view,

P

< 0.01,

Fig. S1D

). Furthermore, the expression levels of the RGC marker proteins Thy-1 (a surface glycoprotein uniquely expressed on RGCs) and β3-tubulin showed a significant decrease in the retinal tissues of STZ-administrated DR mice (quantified from retinal tissues of six mice per group,

P

< 0.001 vs. control mice,

Fig. S1E

). Notably, administration of CN2097 potently mitigated the downregulation of Thy-1 and β3-tubulin proteins (

P

< 0.001 vs. DR mice,

Fig. S1E

).

CN2097 binds the PSD95 with relatively low affinity (

Naik et al., 2024

). Additionally, although the cyclic peptide was based on the C-terminal sequence of CRIPT which specifically binds the PDZ3 domain, we surprisingly found that CN2097 also interacts with the PDZ1 domain, which could reduce efficacy (

Naik et al., 2024

). A model of CN2097 bound to PDZ3 domain is shown in

Fig. 1A

.

Syn3 enhances BDNF-TrkB signaling in primary RGCs.

Experiment guided models of CN2097 interaction with PSD95 PDZ3 domain and Syn3 interaction with the longer PDZ3cα domain. These models were built using sparse NMR chemical shift perturbation data using software Haddock version 2.4. (A). The amino acid structure/sequence of Syn3 is also presented (A). The primary murine or human RGCs were pretreated with Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L) or vehicle control (saline, “Veh”) for 20 min, followed by BDNF stimulation (25 ng/mL) for listed time, expression of listed proteins in total cell lysates was tested (B, C, E, and F). The primary murine RGCs with the lentiviral TrkB shRNA (“shTrkB”) or the lentiviral scramble control non-sense shRNA (“shC”) were treated with BDNF (25 ng/mL) plus Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L, 20 min pretreatment) (“BDNF + Syn3”) for 20 min and were tested for the listed proteins in total lysates (D). The primary murine RGCs were pretreated with Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L) or vehicle control (saline, “Veh”) for 20 min, followed by BDNF stimulation (25 ng/mL) for 5 min, TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 association was tested by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays (G), and their expression examined (in “Input,” G). The primary murine RGCs with the listed lentiviral PSD95 shRNA (“shPSD95-s1” or “shPSD95-s2”) or the lentiviral scramble control shRNA (“shC”) were treated with BDNF + Syn3 and were analyzed for the listed proteins in total cellular lysates (H). The primary murine RGCs with the lentiviral Gαi1 shRNA plus lentiviral Gαi3 shRNA (Gαi1/3-shRNA) or the lentiviral scramble control shRNA (shC) were treated with BDNF + Syn3 or vehicle control (saline, “Veh”) and were analyzed for the listed proteins in total cellular lysates (I). Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

To develop a compound that binds the PDZ3 domain with higher affinity we took advantage of a unique αC helix located after the PDZ3 domain (

Naik et al., 2024

). A novel peptidomimetic, Syn3, was designed that fused the αC helix-interacting residues derived from SynGAP with the CRIPT-cyclic peptide PBM, which increased PDZ3 affinity by five-fold compared to CN2097 (

Naik et al., 2024

). Surface plasmon resonance results show that Syn3 has significantly higher on-rates (ka) as well as off-rates (kd) than CN2097 (

Naik et al., 2024

). A model of Syn3 bound to a longer PDZ3cα domain illustrates the binding of SynGAP-derived residues with the αC helix (

Fig. 1A

). Despite both compounds containing the CRIPT-cyclic peptide, which interacts similarly within the groove formed between the first alpha helix and the second β-strand of the PDZ3 domain, variations exist in their binding orientations (

Fig. 1A

).

Testing the ability of Syn3 to enhance BDNF signaling in primary murine RGCs, Syn3 significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473) and p70S6 kinase (S6K, Thr-389) (

P

< 0.001 vs. BDNF-only treatment), without affecting TrkB phosphorylation (

Fig. 1B

and

1C

). Notably, Syn3 was effective at one-tenth the concentration (0.2 μmol/L) required by CN2097 to produce equivalent results. The protein expression of TrkB, Akt1, and S6K in the murine RGCs was unchanged by BDNF or BDNF + Syn3 (

Fig. 1B

and

1C

). Significantly, TrkB silencing using a lentivirus-packed shRNA (“shTrkB”) blocked BDNF (25 ng/mL) plus Syn3-induced Akt-S6K phosphorylation (

Fig. 1D

), demonstrating that the TrkB receptor is required for Syn3-mediated BDNF signaling. Syn3 treatment alone failed to stimulate TrkB (Tyr-515), Akt (Ser-473), and S6K (Thr-389) phosphorylation (

Fig. S2A

) and also had no effect on insulin or PDGF receptor signaling (

Fig. S2B

). In the primary murine RGCs, treatment with insulin (1 μg/mL) or PDGF (-AB, 25 ng/mL) significantly increased Akt-S6K phosphorylation, which was not augmented by Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L) (

P

> 0.05 vs. insulin/PDGF single treatment,

Fig. S2B

). These results validate that compounds targeting the PDZ3 domain of PSD95 efficiently and specifically enhance BDNF-TrkB signaling in primary murine RGCs. In primary human RGCs pretreated with Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L), BDNF-induced Akt-S6K phosphorylation was significantly enhanced (

P

< 0.001 vs. BDNF only treatment,

Fig. 1E

and

1F

), whereas PSD95 protein expression and TrkB phosphorylation were unchanged (

Fig. 1E

and

1F

).

Oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) induces neuronal injury via mechanisms believed to mimic neuronal ischemia and hypoxia injury of DR pathology. We exposed primary murine RGCs to OGD for 4 h followed by 36 h of re-oxygenation (OGD/R), resulting in cell death quantified by a decrease in the number of β3-tubulin-stained RGCs (

Fig. S2C

). OGDR stimulation reduced cell viability (CCK-8 OD,

Fig. S2D

) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (a marker of cell death,

Fig. S2E

). Significantly, the decrease in cell count and viability induced by OGD/R, as well as cell death were mitigated by the combined treatment of BDNF (25 ng/mL) and Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L, pretreatment for 20 min) (“BDNF + Syn3”) (

Fig. S2C–E

). This combination rescued a significantly greater number of RGCs from OGD/R compared to treatment with BDNF alone (

P

< 0.01 vs. BDNF-only treatment,

Fig. S2C

–

E

). In confirmation of the CCK-8 and LDH results, OGD/R stimulation was found to induce significant apoptosis activation as evidenced by increased Caspase-3 activity (

Fig. S2F

), Caspase-3/Caspase-9/Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein cleavage (

Fig. S2G

), and TUNEL-positive nuclei (

Fig. S2H

), which was mitigated by BDNF + Syn3 treatment (

Fig. S2F

–

H

). The protective effect of combining BDNF and Syn3 was greater than that achieved with BDNF treatment alone (

P

< 0.01,

Fig. S2F

–

H

). Treatment with the TrkB inhibitor K252a or the Akt-specific inhibitor MK-2206 blocked the effects of Syn3 on BDNF-TrkB signaling (

Fig. S2I

) and protection against OGD/R (

Fig. S2J

–

L

). Similarly in primary human RGCs, BDNF-induced RGC survival against OGD/R was potentiated by Syn3 (

P

< 0.01 vs. BDNF-only treatment,

Fig. S2M

).

The results show that Syn3 enhances TrkB-Akt signaling at a 10-fold lower dose compared to CN2097 to protect RGCs in DR mice. As CN2097 acts to promote TrkB-PSD95 association (

Cao et al., 2013

;

Lau et al., 2023

), mechanistically the enhanced binding affinity of Syn3 for the PDZ3 domain of PSD95 is predicted to more potently promote TrkB-PSD95 association. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results confirmed that Syn3 pretreatment (20 min, 0.2 μmol/L) augmented TrkB-immunoprecipitated PSD95 in primary murine RGCs (

Fig. 1G

). TrkB and PSD95 protein expression was unchanged by BDNF (or plus Syn3) (

Fig. 1G

, “Input”). Our previous studies demonstrated the indispensable role of Gαi1 and Gαi3 (Gαi1/3) in transducing BDNF-TrkB signaling in hippocampal neurons (

Marshall et al., 2018

). Gαi1/3 associated with BDNF-activated TrkB to promote TrkB endocytosis and downstream signaling (

Marshall et al., 2018

). In murine RGCs, BDNF treatment similarly induced TrkB immunoprecipitation with both Gαi1 and Gαi3 (

Fig. 1G

), and augmented with Syn3 pretreatment (20 min, 0.2 μmol/L) (

Fig. 1G

). Gαi2 protein did not associate with TrkB or PSD95 in murine RGCs (

Fig. 1G

). Importantly, silencing of PSD95 using two lentivirus-packed PSD95 shRNAs (“shPSD95-s1” or “shPSD95-s2,” with non-overlapping sequences), impaired BDNF (25 ng/mL) plus Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L, 20 min pretreatment) (“BDNF + Syn3”)-induced Akt and S6K phosphorylation (

Fig. 1H

), and compromised BDNF + Syn3-induced RGC neuroprotection against OGD/R (

Fig. S3A

–

C

). Similarly, in primary human RGCs, the application of lentivirus-packed PSD95 shRNA (“shPSD95-s1”) downregulated PSD95 (

Fig. S3D

) and inhibited BDNF + Syn3-induced Akt-S6K activation (

Fig. S3D

).

To examine the role Gαi1/3 in BDNF signaling and Syn3 function, the expression of Gαi1 and Gαi3 was knocked-down using Gαi1 and Gαi3 shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (Gαi1/3-shRNA) co-added to primary murine RGCs, that resulted in substantial Gαi1 and Gαi3 protein knockdown after six days (

Fig. 1I

), with Gαi2 protein expression remaining unchanged (

Fig. 1I

). Significantly, BDNF (25 ng/mL) plus Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L, 20 min pretreatment) (“BDNF + Syn3”)-induced Akt-S6K phosphorylation was blocked by Gαi1/3 knockdown (

Fig. 1I

). Gαi1/3 silencing did not significantly affect protein expression of TrkB, PSD95, or BDNF + Syn3-induced TrkB phosphorylation (

Fig. 1I

). Following exposure of Gαi1/3-shRNA in murine RGCs, BDNF + Syn3-induced neuroprotection against OGD/R was abolished (

Fig. S4A

–

C

). In contrast, increasing Gαi1 and Gαi3 protein expression augmented the effects of Syn3 on BDNF signaling (

Fig. S4D

). The lentivirus-packed Gαi1- and Gαi3-expressing constructs were co-added to primary murine RGCs, leading to Gαi1 and Gαi3 protein overexpression (“oeGαi1/3”) after six days. In two oeGαi1/3 RGC selections (“Slc1 and Slc2”), BDNF + Syn3-induced Akt and S6K phosphorylation was further increased, while TrkB expression and phosphorylation was unchanged (

Fig. S4D

).

We also utilized dominant negative (DN) strategies to interfere with the association of Gαi1/3 with other signaling proteins. In both the DN-Gαi1 and the DN-Gαi3 constructs the conserved Gly (G) residue was substituted with Thr (T) in G3 box, preventing Gαi1/3 association with adaptor proteins. DN-Gαi1 and DN-Gαi3 lentiviruses were co-added to primary murine RGCs for six days, followed by Western blot to confirm expression in murine RGCs (

Fig. S4E

). In DN-Gαi1/3 murine RGCs, BDNF (25 ng/mL) plus Syn3 (0.2 μmol/L, 20 min pretreatment) (“BDNF + Syn3”)-induced Akt and S6K phosphorylation was inhibited (

Fig. S4E

) and TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 association was disrupted (

Fig. S4F

). The Gαi1 shRNA-expressing lentivirus and the Gαi3 shRNA-expressing lentivirus (Gαi1/3-shRNA) were also added to primary human RGCs and two cell selections established, “Slc1” and “Slc2,” in which Gαi1 and Gαi3 were silenced (

Fig. S4G

). Gαi2, TrkB, PSD95 protein expression, and BDNF + Syn3-induced TrkB phosphorylation were unchanged (

Fig. S4G

). Importantly, BDNF + Syn3-induced Akt and S6K phosphorylation was inhibited in Gαi1/3-shRNA-expressing primary human RGCs (

Fig. S4G

).

Using the DR mouse model, we examined the efficacy of Syn3 to mitigate RGC cell death

in vivo.

Syn3 was intravitreously injected at one-tenth of the concentration of CN2097 using the protocol shown in

Fig. 2A

. In DR mice, 10 weeks after the last STZ administration, HE staining of retinal sections showed a significant decrease in the number of nuclei in the GCL by 57.72% ± 6.28% compared to vehicle control mice (

P

< 0.001, with nine mice per group,

Fig. 2B

and

2C

). Importantly, the administration of Syn3 significantly mitigated RGC degeneration in DR mice (14.11 ± 1.54 vs. 20.22 ± 1.48 per view,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. 2B

and

2C

). NeuN fluorescence staining of the retina section (

Fig. 2D

and

2E

), confirmed the loss of NeuN-positive RGCs in GCL of DR mice (45.14% ± 9.17% of control mice,

Fig. 2D

and

2E

). Remarkably, Syn3 administration significantly attenuated RGC degeneration in DR mice (

Fig. 2D

and

2E

). The number of RGCs in the GCL (per view) was 9.78 ± 1.99 in DR mice, which increased to 14.11 ± 2.14 following Syn3 administration (random GCL views of nine mice per group,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. 2D

and

2E

).

Figure 2.

Syn3 mitigates RGCs degeneration in DR mice.

DR mice were intravitreously injected with or without Syn3 (5 pmol in 0.5 μL saline) twice (A); 10 weeks after the last streptozotocin (STZ) administration, HE staining on paraffin-embedded retinal sections was performed and number of nuclei in GCL was quantified (B and C). NeuN/DAPI fluorescence staining in the retinal sections was shown and the number of NeuN-positive nuclei in GCL was quantified (D and E, scale bar = 100 μm). The fluorescence images of flat-mounted retinal GCL showing NeuN-/β3-tubulin-positive RGCs were presented and the number of RGCs was recorded (F and G). β3-Tubulin/DAPI fluorescence staining in the retinal slides was also shown and β3-tubulin fluorescence intensity was quantified (H and I). Expression of β3-tubulin and Thy-1 in retinal tissue lysates was tested by Western blot assays (J). The visual evoked potential (VEP) P100 amplitude was also recorded (F). DR mice were intravitreously injected with Syn3 (5 pmol), or plus MK-2205 (20 pmol)/K252a (2 pmol) twice (M); 10 weeks after the last streptozotocin (STZ) administration, NeuN/DAPI fluorescence staining in the retinal slides was carried out and the number of NeuN-positive nuclei in GCL was quantified (N). The retinal slides were also subjected to β3-tubulin/DAPI fluorescence staining, and β3-tubulin fluorescence intensity in GCL was quantified (O). Retinal tissues were collected and expression of listed proteins was shown (P). Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Moreover, the flat-mounted GCL immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that the number of β3-tubulin-NeuN double-positive RGCs was significantly decreased in the retinas of DR mice (53.78% ± 10.22% of Ctrl mice,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. 2F

and

2G

). Following Syn3 administration, the number of RGC staining for β3-tubulin and NeuN in DR mice was significantly increased (142.11 ± 27.00 vs. 214.22 ± 39.38 per view, random retinal views of nine mice per group,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. 2F

and

2G

). Furthermore, the β3-tubulin fluorescence intensity was reduced in the GCL of DR mice (

Fig. 2H

and

2I

), which was ameliorated by Syn3 administration (

Fig. 2H

and

2I

). The expression of the RGC marker proteins, β3-tubulin and Thy-1, was decreased in retinal tissues from DR mice (

Fig. 2J

) and their expression was restored by Syn3 administration (

Fig. 2J

).

Using an electroretinogram (ERG) to measure the neuronal electrical activity of the retina in response to light, we found that the visual evoked potential (VEP) P100 amplitude in DR mice was reduced to 53.05% ± 15.94 % from that of control mice (

P

< 0.001, nine mice per group,

Fig. 2K

and

2L

). Syn3 administration restored VEP (6.45 ± 1.94 μV vs. 10.64 ± 1.05 μV,

P

< 0.001,

n

= 9 mice per group,

Fig. 2K

and

2L

), demonstrating that Syn3 maintained retinal function in DR mice. Importantly, the TrkB inhibitor K252a or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 reversed Syn3-induced RGC protection in DR mice, showing that TrkB-Akt activation is required for the action of Syn3 (

Fig. 2M

). Syn3-induced inhibition of NeuN-positive RGC loss (

Fig. 2N

) and reduction in β3-tubulin fluorescence intensity (

Fig. 2O

) was reversed by co-administration of K252a or MK-2206. Western blot of retinal tissues confirmed that K252a and MK-2206 inhibited Akt and S6K phosphorylation in Syn3-treated mice (

Fig. 2P

).

Next, we examined whether the neuronal knockdown of Gαi1 and Gαi3 would lead to RGC degeneration. AAV9 viruses expressing Gαi1 shRNA and Gαi3 shRNA were intravitreously injected into C57B/6J mice, generating Gαi1 and Gαi3 neuronal double knockdown (“Gαi1/3-nDKD”) mice after 5 weeks (

Fig. S5A

). Control mice were intravitreously injected with AAV9-hSyn-scramble control shRNA (“shC”) virus. To confirm the specificity of the construct, an AAV9-hSyn-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) was intravitreously injected into C57B/6J mice and EGFP-positive staining was exclusively detected in GCL after 5 weeks (

Fig. S5B

).

In the retinal tissues of Gαi1/3-nDKD mice,

Gαi1

and

Gαi3

mRNA and protein levels were substantially decreased (

P

< 0.001 vs. shC mice,

n

= 5,

Fig. S5C

and

).

Gαi2

mRNA and protein expression in retinal tissues was not significantly changed. Gαi1/3-nDKD largely inhibited Akt and S6K phosphorylation in the retinal tissues (

P

< 0.001 vs. shC mice,

n

= 5,

Fig. S5D

). TrkB protein expression, and its phosphorylation and PSD95 protein expression were unchanged after Gαi1/3-nDKD (

Fig. S5D

). In Gαi1/3-nDKD mice, Syn3 administration (

Fig. S5A

) failed to alter

Gαi1

/

2

/

3

mRNA and protein expression (

Fig. S5C

and

S5D

), or affect TrkB-Akt-S6K phosphorylation in retinal tissues (

Fig. S5D

). These

in vivo

results further support the requirement of Gαi1/3 in Syn3-induced signaling.

Importantly, Gαi1/3-nDKD resulted in RGC degeneration. The number of NeuN-positive RGCs in the GCL of Gαi1/3-nDKD mice was 52.06% ± 8.92% of that in shC mice (quantifying random retinal views of nine mice per group,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. S5E

). Syn3 administration failed to attenuate RGCs degeneration in Gαi1/3-nDKD mice (

Fig. S5E

). The number of RGCs in GCL (per view) was 11.22 ± 1.92 in Gαi1/3-nDKD mice and was 10.78 ± 2.39 with Syn3 administration (quantifying random GCL views of nine mice per group,

P

> 0.05,

Fig. S5E

). Moreover, expression of the RGC marker proteins, Thy-1 and β3-tubulin, was decreased in retinal tissues of Gαi1/3-nDKD mice (quantifying retinal tissues from five mice per group,

P

< 0.001 vs. shC mice,

Fig. S5F

), which was again not prevented by Syn3 administration (

P

> 0.05,

Fig. S5F

). The quantified retinal flat mount RGC number results validated a decrease in TuJ1-positive RGCs in Gαi1/3-nDKD mice (quantifying random views of nine mice per group,

P

< 0.001,

Fig. S5G

). The administration of Syn3 failed to alleviate RGC degeneration in Gαi1/3-nDKD mice (with cell counts of 125.67 ± 13.37 vs. 127.00 ± 11.75, quantifying random views of nine mice per group,

P

> 0.05,

Fig. S5G

). Utilizing electroretinography (ERG) to assess the neuronal responses of the retina to light stimuli, the VEP P100 amplitude in Gαi1/3-nDKD mice decreased to 60.19% ± 9.37% compared to control mice (

P

< 0.001, with nine mice per group,

Fig. S5H

), and Syn3 administration did not significantly restore VEP amplitude (7.10 ± 1.11 μV vs. 6.89 ± 1.78 μV,

P

> 0.05, with nine mice per group,

Fig. S5H

).

The overexpression of Gαi1 and Gαi3 protein expression was found to augment the effects of Syn3 on BDNF signaling (

Fig. S4

). To examine if overexpression of Gαi1 and Gαi3 promotes the survival of RGCs

in vivo

, Gαi1 cDNA and Gαi3 cDNA sequences were individually inserted into the GV680 vector, and packed to generate AAV: AAV9-hSyn-Gαi1-OE and AAV9-hSyn-Gαi3-OE. Both viruses were intravitreously injected into adult mice (4-week old) and specifically increased Gαi1 and Gαi3 expression in RGCs (“Gαi1/3-nDOE”) after 5 weeks (

Fig. S6A

). As compared to vector (“Vec”) control mice,

Gαi1

and

Gαi3

mRNA (

Fig. S6B

) and protein (

Fig. S6C

) expression was significantly increased in the retinal tissues of Gαi1/3-nDOE mice, whereas

Gαi2

mRNA (

Fig. S6B

) and protein (

Fig. S6C

) expression was unchanged. Significantly, Gαi1/3-nDOE potently increased Akt and S6K phosphorylation in retinal tissue (

Fig. S6C

).

Exploring whether neuronal overexpression of Gαi1 and Gαi3 could prevent RGC degeneration in DR mice, 5 weeks after the last STZ administration, AAV9-hSyn-Gαi1-OE and AAV9-hSyn-Gαi3-OE were intravitreously injected into the mice, establishing Gαi1/3-nDOE after another 5 weeks (

Fig. S6D

). In STZ-administrated vector (“Vec”) mice, β3-tubulin and Thy-1 protein expression in retinal tissues was significantly decreased (

Fig. S6E

) but was mitigated in Gαi1/3-nDOE mice (

Fig. S6E

). These results demonstrate that neuronal overexpression of Gαi1 and Gαi3 can prevent RGC degeneration in DR mice, mimicking the actions of Syn3.

In the present study we demonstrate the neuroprotective efficacy of CN2097 and Syn3 in the retina through their ability to enhance TrkB signaling. In mouse and human primary RGCs, CN2097 significantly amplified BDNF-induced signaling, and in the STZ-induced DR mice, CN2097 mitigated RGC degeneration. In mouse and human primary RGCs, Syn3, which has a 5-fold higher affinity for the PSD95 PDZ3 domain, significantly increased BDNF-induced downstream signaling at one-tenth of the effective concentration of CN2097. Although CN2097 binds strongly to the PDZ3 domain of PSD95, it can also bind the PDZ1 domain, which may explain why it is less effective in stimulating BDNF signaling. Pretreatment of primary RGCs with Syn3 at 0.2 μmol/L, enhanced the BDNF-induced neuroprotection against OGD/R. Syn3 significantly increased RGC counts and inhibited apoptosis. These results were confirmed

in vivo

in the DR mouse model. Intravitreous injection of Syn3, at one-tenth, the concentration of CN2097, dramatically attenuated RGCs degeneration in DR mice and maintained retinal function.

We have established Gαi1/3 as pivotal signaling mediators in the activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway by BDNF-TrkB. This study reveals that Gαi1/3 plays a crucial role as signaling mediators of the Syn3-enhancement of BDNF signaling. Syn3 treatment facilitated BDNF-induced formation of the TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 complex, a pivotal step for initiating downstream Akt-mTOR signaling activation. Silencing of PSD95 inhibited the Syn3 facilitation of Akt-mTOR signaling following BDNF stimulation, underscoring the dependence of Syn3-enhanced BDNF signaling on PSD95. Similarly, Gαi1/3 gene silencing or DN mutations substantially inhibited downstream Akt-mTOR activation and suppressed the neuroprotective efficacy of Syn3. Conversely, overexpression of Gαi1/3 enhanced the activation of the downstream signaling pathways induced by Syn3 + BDNF.

In vivo

, neuronal silencing of Gαi1/3 significantly inhibited Akt-mTOR activation and reduced the number of RGCs. Notably, treatment with Syn3 did not increase Akt-mTOR activation or the number of RGCs within Gαi1/3-nDKD mice. In the DR model mice, neuronal overexpression of Gαi1/3 in RGCs enhanced Akt-mTOR activation and mitigated damage to RGCs. These results confirm the essential role of Gαi1/3 in Syn3-facilitated Akt-mTOR activation and associated neuroprotective effects.

This study shows the potential benefits of BDNF-enhancing compounds in mitigating diabetic retinal neurodegeneration. Our most promising compound, Syn3, exhibits high affinity and specificity for binding to the PDZ3 domain of PSD95. PDZ3 binding enhances the formation a TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 complex in RGCs to enhance BDNF downstream signaling, thereby promoting survival. Our findings demonstrate that the development of drugs targeting the TrkB-PSD95-Gαi1/3 pathway offers a promising therapeutic approach for various conditions involving retinal neurodegeneration.

<Date>: 2021-9-8

Significance Statement

Adaptations to changes in the environment are facilitated by behavioral flexibility, and inflexible behavior is observed in several mental health disorders. The

Syn3

gene encodes synapsin III, a protein that negatively regulates phasic dopamine release by sequestering vesicles away from the ready-releasable pool. Previous research has shown a positive genetic correlation between

Syn3

expression in brain and behavioral flexibility in a reversal learning task. Here, we show that mice carrying null alleles of the

Syn3

gene exhibit less flexible responding following contingency reversal. These data reveal novel information about genetic mechanisms that may contribute to the impaired flexibility observed in multiple psychiatric conditions.

Introduction

Behavioral flexibility relates to an individual’s ability to modify behavioral patterns in changing environmental conditions. Deficits in behavioral flexibility have been characterized in several psychiatric disorders (

Uddin, 2021

), including schizophrenia (

Waltz and Gold, 2007

;

Waltz, 2017

), autism spectrum disorder (

Kelly and Reed, 2021

), obsessive-compulsive disorder (

Gruner and Pittenger, 2017

;

Vaghi et al., 2017

), and substance use disorders (

Ersche et al., 2010

;

Winstanley et al., 2010

;

Robbins et al., 2012

;

Istin et al., 2017

).

Reversal learning is an operant test of behavioral flexibility in which an initial association (stimulus–response or response–outcome) is learned through reinforcement, before the conditions for reinforcement are reversed and the organism is tested for its ability to update behavior (

Izquierdo and Jentsch, 2012

;

Izquierdo et al., 2017

). In other words, one response is established as prepotent during initial acquisition through positive feedback and must then be inhibited or changed during reversal testing to procure reward.

Laughlin et al. (2011)

evaluated reversal learning in a panel of BXD mouse strains and used a genome-wide linkage approach to model the impact of genetic variation on the reversal phenotype. A genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) on mouse chromosome 10 was identified, and

Syn3

, the gene encoding synapsin III, emerged as a positional candidate expressed from that genomic region.

Syn3

mRNA expression is regulated in

cis

, and its expression in the hippocampus, neocortex, and striatum was found to be positively genetically correlated with reversal learning performance in the BXD panel, such that greater

Syn3

expression associated with faster reversal learning (

Laughlin et al., 2011

). Synapsin III is a member of the synapsin family of neuronal phosphoproteins (

Kao et al., 1998

). Synapsin III can be localized on the cytoplasmic side of synaptic vesicles and is implicated in neurotransmitter release.

Feng et al. (2002)

demonstrated that loss of synapsin III led to larger vesicular recycling pools but did not alter vesicular release or quantal dynamics. Synapsin proteins regulate a distal reserve pool of vesicles (

Greengard et al., 1993

;

Hilfiker et al., 1999

,

2005

). Functionally, a loss of synapsin III prevents vesicles from being sequestered away from the ready-releasable pool, promoting more sustained release during continued stimulation. In a typical case, sustained release is limited by the rate of transfer of vesicles from the reserve pool to the active zone; this rate-limiting process is theoretically disrupted in cells lacking synapsin III as vesicles are inadequately sequestered in the reserve.

Synapsins are differentially expressed in neuronal populations.

Bogen et al. (2006)

found that selective deletion of synapsin I and II substantially reduced vesicular uptake of GABA and glutamate but did not alter dopamine (DA) uptake. Deletion reduced the concentration of vesicular transporters related to glutamate and GABA, but not vesicular monoamine transporter 2, the transporter responsible for packaging dopamine. Further, synapsin I and II colocalized in cells expressing vesicular transporters for GABA and glutamate, but not in dopaminergic terminals. A subsequent study used a triple knock-out approach to investigate differential regulation of dopamine and serotonin by synapsins (

Kile et al., 2010

): serotonin was not altered by the deletion of all three synapsins, but DA release was significantly enhanced. Selective deletion of synapsin III also elicited enhanced DA release, demonstrating a distinct role for the synapsins in regulating neurotransmitter release. Because DA is extensively implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, subcellular proteins, which contribute to dopamine dynamics, and the genes encoding them are of interest.

The action of dopamine on its cognate receptors in corticostriatal systems are functionally implicated in behavioral flexibility and reversal learning. Inactivation of the D

1

-mediated direct pathway of the basal ganglia interfered with the acquisition of novel and reversed contingencies, while inactivation of the D

2

-mediated indirect pathway interfered selectively with reversal performance by increasing perseverative errors (

Yawata et al., 2012

). Selective deletion of presynaptic D

2

receptors also tended to impair reversal performance and increased the number of attempts required to complete a sustained observing response (OR) to initiate a trial (

Linden et al., 2018

), a deficit related to waiting impulsivity (

Dalley and Ersche, 2019

).

Groman et al. (2011)

found that D

2

receptor availability in the caudate and putamen of vervet monkeys was correlated with reversal learning performance and sensitivity to positive feedback. In a study examining DA in a compulsivity-relevant behavioral phenotype,

Barker et al. (2013)

found that inhibiting D

1

or activating D

2

in the infralimbic cortex promotes behavioral flexibility. D

2

agonism in the nucleus accumbens impairs flexibility (

Haluk and Floresco, 2009

), as does systemic antagonism of D

2

/D

3

receptors (

Lee et al., 2007

). Human reversal learning performance was also found to correlate with the activation of an OFC–amygdala pathway mediated by D

2

receptors (

van der Schaaf et al., 2013

). These data indicate that there are region- and task-specific implications for DA in behavioral flexibility.

In this study, we investigated the role of

Syn3

on reversal learning performance using a genetic knock-out strategy. Mice expressing 0, 1, or 2 functional

Syn3

alleles were tested for reversal learning. We hypothesized that

Syn3

function would be related to behavioral flexibility; mice lacking functional

Syn3

would exhibit deficits in reversal learning performance without showing impairments in the acquisition of the initial discrimination.

Materials and Methods

Animals

C57BL/6N-Syn3

tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg

/J mice (RRID:

MMRRC_049950-UCD

) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. This strain was developed by the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) and harbors a reporter-tagged deletion allele. This strain has been phenotyped by KOMP, with the results of those studies being publicly available at the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium website (

https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:1351334#phenotypesTab

).

Mice in the present study were maintained through heterozygote crosses, producing all three genotypes (homozygous null, heterozygous, or homozygous wild type, having 0, 1, or 2 functional

Syn3

alleles, respectively) in each litter. They were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium on a 12 h light/dark cycle, with all procedures being conducted in the light phase. Mice were weaned on postnatal day 21, at which point they were housed in same-sex groups of three to five mice per cage. Offspring were genotyped for dosage of wild-type and mutant

Syn3

alleles by Transnetyx from ear tissue collected at weaning.

A total of 112 mice offspring were involved in the study, but 6 were removed because they failed to meet preset discrimination performance criteria or because of experimenter errors. Mice that did not acquire the initial discrimination within 30 sessions were excluded from analysis (

n

= 2, both heterozygous null). Four mice were excluded because of experimenter error. The final number of mice included in the forthcoming analyses was 106: 54 females (26 homozygous null, 14 heterozygous null, and 14 homozygous wild type), and 52 males (11 null, 28 heterozygous, and 13 wild type). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the relevant Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all procedures were carried out consistent with the

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals

(

National Research Council, 2011

).

Reversal learning

The parameters of the reversal task were selected to match those reported in the study by

Laughlin et al. (2011)

, which identified

Syn3

as a candidate gene. Before the onset of these studies, mice were briefly handled daily to be weighed and tail marked. Subsequently, mice were food restricted to ∼85% of their free feeding body weights; mice were fed once per day, after testing, an amount that was individually titrated to achieve this reduced weight. Before the start of the experiment, mice were offered ∼0.5 g of reinforcer pellets (14 mg of Dustless Precision pellets; stock #F05684, Bio-Serv) per mouse in their home cage to familiarize them with the reward before operant exposure. All mice of all genotypes consumed the reward pellets in their home cages.

All testing took place in operant conditioning chambers (model MED-NP5M-D1, Med Associates), each enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle. The chambers were equipped with a house light and white noise generator, located outside of the chamber but within the cubicle. A photocell-equipped food delivery magazine connected to a pellet dispenser were on one wall of the chamber, and a horizontal array of five nose-poke apertures were on the opposite wall. Mice were first exposed to the testing chamber in a single 30 min habituation session, with the house light and white noise on. Magazine training began the following day. Reinforcer pellets were delivered into the internally illuminated magazine at the start of these sessions, and again every 30 s after each pellet was retrieved, until 50 pellets were delivered or 45 min passed, whichever occurred first. Mice remained in magazine training until they retrieved 50 pellets in a single session.

A three-stage aperture training followed. In the first stage, the food magazine was illuminated at the start of the session, and head entry resulted in pellet delivery, termination of magazine illumination, and illumination of the central nose poke aperture on the opposite wall. A response into the lit central nose poke terminated the nose poke illumination and led to illumination of the magazine and delivery of a pellet; a variable OR nose poke time of 0, 10, 20, or 40 centiseconds (cs) was required, randomized from trial to trial. Stages 2 and 3 followed the same general schedule, progressively increasing the OR duration array. In stage 2, the observing response array increased as a function of the rewards earned. When <15 reinforcers had been earned, an OR of 0, 10, 20, or 40 cs could be required. For reinforcers 16–25, OR times could be 0, 20, 30, or 50 cs. For the remainder of the session, OR durations could be 0, 20, 40, or 60 cs. Stage 3 OR durations were 20, 40, or 60 cs throughout the session. Transition from one stage to the next required mice to earn at least 30 reinforcers in a single session.

Mice began discrimination acquisition training the day following completion of stage 3. Here, an observing response in the central nose poke aperture (variable hold requirement of 20, 40, or 60 cs) initiated a trial, at which point the aperture holes flanking the center were both illuminated. Mice had 30 s to make an entry into one of those two apertures and were reinforced with two pellets for selecting the “correct” one and were punished with a 5 s time-out with all visual stimuli off for selecting the “incorrect” one. Which of the two apertures was selected to be correct was pseudorandomly assigned for each mouse and maintained throughout discrimination training. Failure to respond within the 30 s window was scored as an omission. Omissions were followed by a 5 s time-out. Correct and incorrect responses, as well as omissions, were followed by a 3 s intertrial interval (ITI), during which no apertures were illuminated. Each session lasted for 125 trials, 60 min, or until the discrimination criterion was met, whichever occurred first. The criterion for completing discrimination acquisition training was 80% correct responses in a sliding window of 20 trials. Mice that made fewer than five responses during 2 consecutive days of discrimination acquisition training were returned to stage 2 of aperture training, and then returned to the discrimination phase after passing aperture training again. Mice failing to respond in the reversal phase were not transferred back to training but were removed from the study. This did not apply to any mice tested in this experiment.

Reversal began the day after mice completed discrimination training. Testing conditions were identical, except that the aperture that resulted in pellet delivery during discrimination no longer produced reward and the opposite aperture now resulted in delivery of two pellets. Animals were tested until reaching the same performance criterion used during acquisition.

Dependent variables

A series of calculated dependent variables is used to evaluate the performance of individual mice in the test; all variables are calculated separately for the acquisition and reversal stages. The number of trials required to reach the preset performance criterion is a key dependent variable, as this was the variable subject to the genome-wide linkage studies in the study by

Laughlin et al. (2011)

that led to the selection of

Syn3

as a positional candidate gene. Higher trait values are indicative of more difficulty with learning the initial or reversed rule.

To better understand the impact of contingency reversal on the number of trials required to reach performance criteria, a reversal fold-change variable was calculated as the number of trials to criterion in the reversal phase divided by the number of trials in the initial discrimination phase.

To investigate the influence of prior outcome on future choices, a behavioral flexibility score was calculated for each subject (

Aarde et al., 2019

). The behavioral flexibility score quantifies the trade-off between flexibility and stability in choice behavior. The correct response following a reward delivery is to make the same choice again (“win-stay” or success through stability), while the correct choice following a time-out is to make the opposite choice on the next trial (“lose-shift” or success through flexibility). We evaluated flexibility in response to positive and negative feedback by determining the relative likelihood of shifting behavior on the subsequent trial. Behavioral flexibility scores were calculated independently for positive and negative feedback as (shift trials – stay trials)/(shift trials + stay trials), and are bound by −1 and 1, with −1 indicating that the subject never shifted responding, and 1 indicating they always shift. In our task, the optimal flexibility score following positive feedback is −1; and optimal flexibility following negative feedback is +1.

Anticipatory responses are responses made to the correct or incorrect apertures after one trial has been completed but before the next one has been started by a satisfactory OR (i.e., during the ITI or trial initiation periods). These responses were counted and expressed as a fraction of the total number of trials initiated. As noted above, ORs of minimum duration were required to initiate a trial; in some cases, mice broke their OR before reaching the minimum criterion, and these OR failures were counted as a fraction of the number of presentations of each observing response duration.

A number of latency measures were collected to allow for deeper analysis of reversal learning performance and progression through stages of the task. Trial initiation latencies were measured as the time (in deciseconds, ds) from the start of a new trial to initiation of the observing response. Response latencies were measured as the time (in cs) between the presentation of the target apertures and the selection of one option; these were divided into correct and incorrect latencies, based on the outcome of the trial. Pellet retrieval latencies were measured as the time (in ds) between pellet delivery following a correct response and head entry into the magazine.

Statistical analyses

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to model the effect of genotype, sex, phase, and their interactions on performance. The model used the robust estimator for the covariance matrix, an unstructured correlation matrix, the maximum likelihood method of parameter estimation, type III model effects, and the χ

2

Wald statistic for the full log quasi-likelihood function. Normality and linearity were assessed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and P-P (probability-probability) plots, respectively. In cases where normality and linearity were validated, a normal distribution with identity link function was used. In cases where linearity or normality were violated, transformations were conducted and gamma and inverse Gaussian distributions were tested. Intercept-only models (i.e., models lacking sex and genotype as predictors) were built for each variable to assess goodness of fit using the Corrected Quasi-Likelihood under Independence Model Criterion.

Table 1

shows the relevant transformations and model information for each test. Phase was not included as a within-subject predictor in reversal fold change because this variable denotes a ratio between acquisition and reversal, so phase is inherently accounted for. Pairwise

post hoc

tests were used to evaluate significant model effects on all main and interaction effects, except the main effect of genotype; genotype was analyzed using a simple contrast

post hoc

analysis with homozygous wild-type mice as the reference group. All

post hoc

tests used the Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. Means in the text are estimated marginal means (EMMs) ± SEM unless otherwise stated. Data are presented in figures as raw ± SEM unless otherwise stated. Effect size was calculated for significant effects: ϕ (φ) was calculated when df

V

(

Results

Trials to criterion

Mice required an average of 4.30 (SE = 0.486) sessions to complete the acquisition phase and 4.79 (SE = 0.388) to complete the reversal phase. There were no significant effects of genotype or sex, or any interaction between these variables.

As expected, mice required significantly larger numbers of trials to reach a performance criterion in the reversal versus acquisition stage (χ

ablation may differentially affect males and females. There was no significant main effect of sex or any higher-level interactions involving sex (all χ

An estimation statistics approach was used to further explore the data in light of our a priori hypothesis. All genotypes exhibited equivalent acquisition of the initial discrimination (

Fig. 1

a

), and all experienced more difficulty with reaching performance criteria in the reversal, compared with the initial phase (

Fig. 1

b

, bottom). However, the magnitude of increase in trials to criteria does not appear to be the same across genotypes. Specifically, heterozygous-null mice experienced considerable difficulty in meeting the criteria following contingency reversal.

To better visualize the reversal-specific impairments, a fold change statistic was calculated and visualized (

), and a GEE model was fit to the data. Genotype was found to significantly influence reversal fold change (χ

(2,

N

=106)

= 7.958,

p

=

0.019,

V

= 0.194;

Table 2

), and

post hoc

analysis revealed that reversal more substantially impaired performance in heterozygous mutant mice (mean = 2.89, SE = 0.37) compared with homozygous wild-type mice (mean = 1.95, SE = 0.26;

post hoc

test,

p

=

0.037). The

post hoc

contrast comparing homozygous wild-type and homozygous mutant genotypes also trended on significance (

p

=

0.064), and the Cumming estimation plot (

Fig. 1

c

) shows only a very small portion of the mean difference distribution would support the null hypothesis that homozygous mutants are phenotypically equivalent to homozygous wild-type mice.

Anticipatory responses

For the results of model effects for anticipatory responses per trial, see

Figure 3

. There were generally more anticipatory responses made during the reversal phase (main effect of phase: χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 102.584,

p

=

0.000, φ = 0.491;

Table 2

). In addition, more anticipatory responses were made on the side that was rewarded during discrimination, regardless of current phase (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 23.541,

p

<

0.001, φ = 0.236). We did not detect a main effect of sex or any higher-level interactions involving sex (all χ

2

< 4.037, all

p

> 0.05;

Table 2

). There was a main effect of genotype for anticipatory responses (χ

2

(2,

N

=106)

= 6.667,

p

=

0.036,

V

= 0.089;

Fig. 2

); however, the direction of the effect was that

Syn3

deletion reduced premature responding. Homozygous wild-type mice made more anticipatory responses than the heterozygous mice (

post hoc

test,

p

=

0.024), and although the Cumming estimation plot comparing genotypes (

Fig. 2

, bottom) suggests a mean difference separation between the homozygous-null and homozygous wild-type groups, our

post hoc

analysis evaluating this difference in our model did not reach to the level of significance (

p

=

0.098). We believe that this is a consequence of adjustments made to the EMM used for

post hoc

analyses within the model. EMMs are adjusted to correct for the influence of other factors in the model to specifically evaluate the variance explained by the factor being tested.

Figure 2.

ablation reduces anticipatory responses compared to wildtype mice.

The line plot in the top panel shows individual data for mice in each genotype group. Paired mean differences comparing discrimination and reversal performance within each group are in the middle panel. Unpaired mean differences comparing each mutant group to the wildtype control group are shown in the bottom panel.

To further investigate this issue, nested mean tables were generated to visualize the pattern of descriptive means as a function of each factor level. Descriptive means at the sex * genotype level showed the same rank-order patterns identified in our

post hoc

and estimation analyses. Specifically, females displayed the same pattern of EMMs (homozygous wild type > homozygous null > heterozygous null), while males matched the pattern seen in genotype-based descriptive means (homozygous wild type > heterozygous null > homozygous null). We next examined genotype * sex EMMs and found the same sex * genotype pattern. EMMs for genotype were then generated excluding sex from the model, and the pattern was found to match that of the descriptive means, suggesting that the inclusion of sex in the model accounted for the observed effects.

Omissions

We found a main effect of phase (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 34.308,

p

=

0.000, φ = 0.402;

Table 2

); mice omitted fewer trials in reversal than in discrimination. No other differences were observed for trial omissions.

OR failures

There was a main effect of phase, such that more observing response failures occurred during the acquisition stage, than during reversal (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 13.536,

p

< 0.001, φ = 0.146;

Table 2

). Longer observing response requirements resulted in more failures per trial (χ

2

(2,

N

=106)

= 754.522,

p

<

0.001,

V

= 0.770;

Fig. 3

post hoc

assessment revealed significant differences among all hold requirements (all pairwise

p

<

0.001). Genotype was also found to significantly impact observing response failures (χ

2

(2,

N

=106)

= 6.086,

p

=

0.048,

V

= 0.069); however,

post hoc

analyses comparing each mutant type to the wild-type control did not reveal pairwise differences. The Cumming estimation plot comparing genotypes (

Fig. 3

, bottom) shows that heterozygous-null and homozygous-null groups deviate from the homozygous wild-type group in opposite directions, suggesting that the main effect of genotype identified in the GEE model is a difference between heterozygous-null and homozygous-null groups.

Latency measures

Latency model effects are reported in

Table 2

. Neither trial initiation latency nor pellet retrieval latency was found to vary as a function of phase, genotype, sex, or their interactions (all

p

>

0.05).

Response latencies were longer in acquisition than in reversal (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 224.982,

p

<

0.001, φ = 0.729). There was also a significant phase * genotype interaction (χ

2

(2,

N

=106)

= 7.254,

p

=

0.027,

V

= 0.093). All mice reduced their response latencies between the acquisition and reversal phases, but the effect was most pronounced in the heterozygous group. There were no differences in latency as a function of correct or incorrect responses (no effects of side, all

p

>

0.05;

Table 2

).

Behavioral flexibility score

Contingency reversal impacted feedback integration in a valence-dependent manner (phase * feedback valence interaction: χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 162.468,

p

<

0.001, φ = 0.875;

Table 2

). In discrimination acquisition, mice exhibited stable behavior following positive feedback (mean = −0.50, SE = 0.023) and flexible behavior following negative feedback (mean = 0.28, SE = 0.037), but this separation was largely lost in the reversal phase (mean positive = −0.20, SE = 0.021; mean negative = −0.19, SE = 0.023). A phase * genotype interaction was identified (χ

2

(2,

N

=106)

= 7.930,

p

=

0.019,

V

= 0.137), and pairwise

post hoc

analysis revealed a more negative flexibility score for null mice in reversal compared with their flexibility in discrimination (

p

=

0.034;

Fig. 4

a

), suggesting the behavior of

Syn3

-null mice were less flexible in reversal than in acquisition. We also identified feedback valence * sex (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 9.039,

p

=

0.003, φ = 0.206) and phase * feedback valence * sex (χ

2

(1,

N

=106)

= 6.379,

p

=

0.012, φ = 0.173) interaction effects. Male mice were less likely to change responses after positive feedback and were more likely to update behavior after negative feedback compared with females (i.e., less flexibility after positive feedback and more flexibility after negative feedback;

Fig. 4

b

), but as with the phase * feedback interaction, this difference only occurred in the discrimination acquisition phase, and differences were not apparent between groups in reversal.

Discussion

In this experiment, we tested the influence of the

Syn3

gene on reversal learning performance in C57BL/6N mice using a global knockout strategy; based on previous systems genetics analysis of this trait in the BXD population (

Laughlin et al., 2011

), we hypothesized that mice lacking

Syn3

would display deficits in reversal learning performance compared with wild-type mice. Portions of our data support that hypothesis, but the precise effect of synapsin III deletion on reversal learning is nuanced and worthy of further exploration.

We found some evidence that reversal learning ability varies as a function of genotype. When a fold-change variable that isolates reversal phase-specific aspects of performance was calculated, significant differences were apparent between the genotypes. Specifically, mice carrying one or two null alleles experienced a larger proportional increase in trials to criterion in reversal compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore,

Syn3

-null mice exhibited less flexible behavior in reversal compared with the initial discrimination (as shown by the flexibility score analysis), again suggesting a reversal-specific deficit. These findings are consistent with previous observations in BXD mice;

Laughlin et al. (2011)

found that the trials to criteria under reversal testing was associated with the chromosome 10 QTL. When that measure was regressed on trials to criteria for the acquisition phase at the individual-subject level, and the mean residual scores per strain (the portion of variance in the reversal data that could not be accounted for by variance in the acquisition data) were submitted to a second genome scan, they found statistically identical results, showing that the association was specific to some reversal-specific feature of behavior.

The rate of learning under the reversal condition was not the only phenotype affected by

Syn3

deletion. Wild-type mice made more anticipatory responses than either mutant group. This measure is conceptually similar to the premature responding phenotype measured in the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT), often interpreted as an indicator of waiting impulsivity (

Dalley and Ersche, 2019

). At a minimum, the dissociation between behavioral flexibility assessed in reversal (impaired) and premature responding (reduced) in

Syn3

-null mice suggests that these two traits are influenced by separate genetic architectures, as existing evidence already suggested (

Nautiyal et al., 2017

). That hypothesis is further supported by recent observations that measures of behavioral flexibility and premature responding are not genetically correlated in the collaborative cross-recombinant inbred panel and their inbred founder strains (

Bailey et al., 2021

). Moreover,

Syn3

negatively affected the ability to maintain the variable duration OR. How, and/or whether, this phenotype is related to their reduced premature responding is unclear. It is also worth noting that premature responding in the 5CSRTT is typically penalized by a time-out period that lengthens the time before the start of the next trial, so the inhibition of premature responses is required for optimal task performance. That is not the case in our reversal learning task; premature responses are recorded but have no programmed consequences.

In our procedure, premature responses could occur during the intertrial interval (before the OR becomes available) or during the trial initiation period (after the OR is available but before the OR duration criterion is met). Responses occurring during the trial initiation period could signal a failure to attend to the discriminative stimulus indicating a reward is now available for the correct choice (i.e., the OR aperture light turns off and the flanking lights turn on). Responding during the intertrial interval is somewhat more difficult to interpret, partially because we are unsure whether these responses occurred following an attempted OR or are independent of an OR. Observing response failures, on the other hand, occurred at very low levels when the OR requirement was low, indicating that the average response duration was likely higher than the minimum OR requirement. As the duration criteria increase, however, failures occur more often. Perfect success could be generated by sustaining the aperture response until the aperture light turns off on all trials, but clearly this is not the strategy used by the mice. Instead, they sustain the OR for some variable period of time that produces almost certain success at the shortest OR duration, and much lower success rates with more sustained response requirements.

Elaborating the microstructure of premature response patterns in reversal learning would lend clarity to the relation between the observing response and the premature or anticipatory response in preparations like ours that require a sequence of behavioral responses to receive a reward. If an OR failure is followed by another OR attempt, the subject is likely still attending to the relevant aperture. If an OR failure is followed by one or more anticipatory responses, the subject has shifted behaviors without attending to the lack of shift in discriminative stimuli. Though both patterns could be classified inefficient, they denote different underlying behavioral strategies. The ability to sustain a response for a sufficient duration measures a different dimension of inhibitory control than the ability to wait for choice conditions to be met before making a response. It is possible that the variable OR duration presented a greater challenge for

Syn3

-null mice by introducing uncertainty into the behavioral response itself. This is functionally distinct from responding in the choice apertures before a choice is available, in which

Syn3

ablation seems to confer an advantage.

Role for DA

Given the known regulatory role of

Syn3

on DA transmission (

Kile et al., 2010

), we can cautiously link our observed results to altered DA dynamics.

Laughlin et al. (2011)

found that

Syn3

expression in the neocortex, hippocampus, and striatum was correlated with reversal learning performance (low Syn3 expression was associated with poor reversal learning performance). Synapsin III negatively regulates DA release by controlling the transfer of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool to the ready-releasable pool (

Feng et al., 2002

), and mice lacking

Syn3

show enhanced striatal phasic DA release compared with wild types (

Kile et al., 2010

). Presumably,

Syn3

deficiency would also induce enhanced release in hippocampus and neocortex, but these effects, to our knowledge, have not been explicitly tested. Inducible and region-specific knockout strategies could be leveraged to better understand the relative contributions of corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuits to reversal learning.

Dopaminergic tone has been implicated in the ability to reverse a learned discrimination (

Klanker et al., 2013

).

Klanker et al. (2015)

identified a key role for ventromedial striatal DA responses to positive feedback while animals acquired a spatial reversal task. In rats that eventually acquired the reversal rule, the first rewarded reversal trial induced a spike in DA (measured via fast-scan cyclic voltammetry) concurrent with reward delivery; in the subsequent trial (i.e., the first trial in which positive feedback can be used to update behavior), an increase in cue-evoked DA was observed. In rats that did not acquire reversal, the first reward induced the same DA spike, but DA release did not shift to cue presentation in the next trial. This effect was specific to positive feedback; DA release during an incorrect trial (i.e., one followed by no reward delivery) or the following trial did not differ between rats that acquired the reversal and those that did not. A change point was defined as the trial at which the cumulative record maximally deviated from a line drawn from the origin to the end of the record (

Klanker et al., 2015

). No differences were observed in cue-evoked DA release in trials before and after the change point, but reward-evoked DA release decreased in trials following the change point. Positive feedback increased cue-evoked DA release on the subsequent trial only before the change point, suggesting feedback-induced shifts in intratrial timing normalize across the learning curve to a level where cue-evoked DA stabilizes, and the learned behavior is reliably expressed. Dopaminergic tone is dynamically engaged throughout the learning curve, and small shifts in the timing of release can aid in reorganization of previously learned behavior in response to positive feedback.

Yawata et al. (2012)

demonstrated independent roles for the direct (D

1

receptor-expressing) and indirect (D

2

receptor-expressing) dopamine-mediated pathways of the basal ganglia by reversibly inducing pathway-specific blockade of neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens using doxycycline in transgenic mice. Interference with the D

1

receptor-expressing direct pathway impaired acquisition of a novel visual discrimination, though no impairment in acquisition was observed when the D

2

receptor-expressing indirect pathway was blocked. Blocking neurotransmission in either the direct or indirect pathway interfered with reversal of the previously learned discrimination, but only inhibiting the indirect pathway neurons increased perseverative errors. This pattern of findings was recapitulated when the direct or indirect pathways were unilaterally blocked via doxycycline, then the contralateral side was treated with D

1

or D

2

agonists or antagonists. Antagonism of accumbal D

1

receptors interfered with the acquisition of initial and reversed discriminations but did not alter perseverative errors, while D

2

agonism selectively hindered reversal performance by increasing perseverative errors (

Yawata et al., 2012

). Together, these results suggest that the D

1

-mediated direct pathway in the basal ganglia is involved in the acquisition of operant responses more generally, while DA release onto the D

2

-mediated indirect pathway is specifically implicated in behavioral flexibility.

Lee et al. (2007)

demonstrated that in monkeys systemic antagonism of D

2

/D

3

, but not D

1

/D

5

, specifically impaired performance following reversal of a previous learned visual discrimination without altering the ability to acquire novel discriminations. In rats, intra-accumbal D

1

, but not D

2

, antagonism disrupted set shifting (a measure of cognitive flexibility), while D

2

, but not D

1

, agonism impaired performance on a reversal task without disrupting initial discrimination (

Haluk and Floresco, 2009

). Although one might expect agonism and antagonism of D

2

receptors to have opposite effects, conceptual and experimental evidence points to a convergent role of the change in dopamine activity to drive behavioral effects. Because D

2

receptors are found both presynaptically and postsynaptically, agonism will inhibit further dopamine release via autoreceptors, while antagonism will interfere with postsynaptic activation even as presynaptic release is disinhibited. In both cases, phasic dopamine activity is disrupted, and reversal learning is impaired.

Phasic DA release has been proposed to serve as a teaching signal, encoding a prediction error signal whereby unexpected outcomes generate an increase in phasic DA (

Schultz, 2019

).

Steinberg et al. (2013)

demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of VTA DA neurons concurrent with reward delivery produced long-lasting enhancement of cue-induced reward seeking.

Saunders et al. (2018)

replicated and extended these findings, demonstrating that VTA, but not SNc, DA release paired with cue presentation evoked conditioned stimulus approach behavior. Further, pairing optogenetic DA stimulation with reward in a behavioral economic procedure shifts the demand curve rightward and upward, indicating higher subjective value to the reward and enhanced motivation to obtain it (

Schelp et al., 2017

). Synapsin III negatively regulates dopamine release by regulating the transfer of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool to the ready-releasable pool (

Feng et al., 2002

), and its absence enhances phasic dopaminergic tone (

Kile et al., 2010

). Thus, mice carrying one or more null

Syn3

alleles may experience the initial acquisition of a discrimination differently, and our test may simply not be sensitive enough to detect any reinforcement learning phenotypes during the initial acquisition stage.

Relevance to substance use disorder

Stimulant drugs of abuse are widely known to act by enhancing dopaminergic activity, either by blocking DA transport (DAT; e.g., cocaine) or by promoting the reverse transport of DA (e.g., amphetamine and methamphetamine). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature regarding dopaminergic alterations in stimulant users found several noteworthy changes in DA dynamics, including reduced overall DA release, reduced DAT availability, reduced D

2

/D

3

receptor availability, and possibly reduced DA synthesis (

Ashok et al., 2017

). Notably, striatal D

2

/D

3

receptor availability has been negatively correlated with reversal learning performance (

Dalley et al., 2007

;

Groman et al., 2011

;

Laughlin et al., 2011

). Theoretically,

Syn3

deletion, by amplifying phasic DA release, may lead to compensatory decreases in D

2

-like receptors in forebrain regions, thereby conferring a less flexible phenotype.

Sex differences in learning

Our analysis identified several sex-related effects in performance. Specifically, we found that, during initial acquisition of the discrimination, homozygous-null male mice required fewer trials to reach criterion than did females of the same genotype. In addition, we found that males engaged in more optimally flexible behavior during discrimination acquisition learning (i.e., males more often made the same choice after positive feedback and switched choices after negative feedback more often than did females), but both sexes responded equivalently to both types of feedback during contingency reversal. This suggests the importance of sex differences in learning strategies during the initial discrimination phase.

Previous research examining sex differences in learning strategy is mixed. Using a probabilistic reversal learning task,

Harris et al. (2021)

found that male rats were more sensitive than females to negative feedback throughout training, with no difference in sensitivity to positive feedback or overall learning rate.

Chen et al. (2021)

tested mice in a visual bandit task and found that females learned faster than males and engaged in a stable strategy throughout the task, while males were more sensitive to previous outcomes and changed their strategy over time. Notably, there were no sex differences in visual bandit performance when reward probabilities were deterministic (

Chen et al., 2021

), which most closely reflects the testing conditions used here. A study using the rodent version of the Iowa Gambling Task found that males learned at a faster rate than females (

van den Bos et al., 2012

), but a modified version of the task used by

Peak et al. (2015)

found that females optimized choice behavior faster (

Orsini and Setlow, 2017

). Despite difficulty in making an overarching statement about sex differences in learning, it is clear from this pattern of results that males and females use task-relevant information differently, resulting in task-specific sex differences in strategy optimization.

Limitations

Our ability to scale our findings up to findings in humans is limited, in part, by the simplicity of our task. In the real world, humans are often required to make decisions based on uncertain information and update behavior as a function of feedback in real time. We use a deterministic task, while tests used in humans often incorporate probabilistic reward delivery to introduce uncertainty and find differential results as a function of that uncertainty (

Chen et al., 2021

). Likewise, intersession (overnight) consolidation can influence learning (

Varga et al., 2014

;

Alizadeh Asfestani et al., 2018

), and our task used a multisession, between-sessions training and testing strategy. Future research attempting to link our mouse genetic findings with human research may need to address these issues.

Conclusions

Here we have demonstrated a role for

Syn3

, encoding synapsin III, in behavioral flexibility. C67BL/6N mice lacking functional

Syn3

alleles experienced a greater proportional cost of contingency reversal than wild-type mice and engaged in less flexible responding during the reversal phase but made fewer anticipatory responses; however, it is important to note that the reported pattern of effects may well be dependent on the genetic background studied (

Sittig et al., 2016

). This suggests that

Syn3

homozygous-null mice were less adaptable to changes in contingency, but this effect was independent of their waiting impulsivity phenotype.

#### SYN3 - Article 4: Use of monitoring levels of soluble forms of cytokeratin 18 in the urine of patients with superficial bladder cancer following intravesical Ad-IFNα/Syn3 treatment in a Phase l study
<Date>: 2014-2-07
<PMCID>: 3962717
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Our phase l study of intravesical Ad-IFNα/Syn3 treatment in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer previously failing BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) therapy has been completed (

1

). The Syn3 is an excipient Syn3 that facilitates effective gene transfer and expression of IFNα within the urothelium and tumor with subsequent secretion into the urine (

2

,

3

). In the phase l study only a single instillation of Ad-IFNα/Syn3 was given. A complete remission (CR) as defined by no evidence of tumor and negative biopsies by cystoscopy 90 days after treatment was found in 6 of the 14 patients treated who produced IFNα in their urine (

1

).

Three distinct mechanisms of cancer cell death caused by Ad-IFNα have been identified by us (

4

–

9

). The IFNα produces a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) - mediated cancer cell kill (

4

) whereas cancer cells which are resistant to the interferon α protein are killed by Ad-IFNα in two additional ways, one indirect (apoptotic) and the other direct (necrotic). The indirect mechanism involves a potent soluble bystander factor(s) secreted by both Ad-IFNα infected tumor and normal urothelial cells which is strongly cytotoxic to all tumor types tested to date, including bladder cancer, but is not cytotoxic to normal cells (

5

,

6

). The direct cancer cell kill occurs from the high level IFNα accumulation found perinuclearly after Ad-IFNα treatment which causes ER stress related cancer cell death (

7

).

Levels of cytokeratins, especially those which detect both caspase-cleaved and intact cytokeratin 18 (CK 18), have been used as biomarkers of tumor cell kill measured in the blood after chemotherapeutic treatment (

10

,

11

). The M30 antibody recognizes a CK18 fragment that is produced following caspase cleavage of the CK18 protein and is thought to be a selective biomarker for apoptotic cell death, whereas the M65 ELISA uses the M5 antibody thought to detect both the uncleaved and cleaved CK18 protein fragments. By subtracting the concentration of cleaved CK18 obtained using the M30 ELISA (M30 increase) from the level obtained in the M65 ELISA, the necrotic component of cell death is determined (M65 increase).

Both the TRAIL and bystander related cancer cell apoptosis produced by Ad-IFNα can be measured by increases in M30, whereas the endoplasmic stress related direct cancer cell death is mostly necrotic and can be measured by an increase in M65 (

7

).

In this report patients from the Phase l trial were studied. Changes in urine M30 and M65 levels as well as IFN and TRAIL levels were examined at various times after intravesical Ad-IFNα /Syn3 treatment. We hypothesized that increases in M30 and M65 level would reflect the mechanisms of tumor cell death produced by the Ad-IFNα and that changes in M30 and M65 levels might be predictive of the CRs obtained.

The urine samples were collected on ice after treatment and were stabilized by the addition of a buffer containing 10% bovine serum albumin and 50 mM HEPES (4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic). 1ml of buffer was added to 10 ml of urine. After centrifugation urine was then stored at −80° C until it was thawed to conduct the various assays. Both early morning samples brought by the patient and a freshly voided urine was collected approximately every 24 hours after treatment.

ELISA M30, M65 and TRAIL assays

M30-Apoptosense and M65 ELISA kits were obtained from Peviva AB (Bromma, Sweden,) and used according to manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 25µl of each urine sample were tested in duplicate or triplicate. 75µl of the combined monoclonal M30 antibody (anti-CK18 Asp 396 neoepitope) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase substrate and the conjugate dilution buffer was added to each well for the M30-Apoptosense ELISA and mouse monoclonal M5 antibody for the M65 ELISA. Incubation times were 4h and 2h for the M30 and M65 ELISAs, respectively. After washing the plate, 200µl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added to each well followed by stop solution (1M sulfuric acid) after 20 minutes. Absorbance was read in a microplate reader at 450nm. Samples were diluted, as necessary, for the absorbance (450nm) to fall within the range of the standard curve. TRAIL protein levels were determined using the TRAIL ELISA kit purchased from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN according to the manufacturer’s instructions (

). All results were given in units (U/L).

Determination of IFNα levels

IFNα levels were determined by ELISA from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN utilizing the manufacturer protocol with the extended range standard curve. Briefly, 100µl of each urine sample and standards were tested in duplicate or triplicate. After one hour incubation and plate washing, 100µl of HRP substrate was added to each well. After incubation for 1h and washing the plate, 100µl TMP substrate solution was added to each well followed by stop solution. Absorbance was read in a microplate reader at 450nm. Samples were diluted, as necessary, for the absorbance (450nm) to fall within the range of the standard curve. Final results were given as pg/ml.

Biostatistical Analysis

Patients were analyzed to determine if M30 and /or M65 levels could be correlated with achieving a CR. Each patient was classified as having M30 levels which returned to normal levels if it reached a level below 175 U/L by day 10 or day 14 after treatment when the last urine sample was obtained for a given patient. Similarly patients were classified as having M65 return to normal levels using the same threshold. These were the levels seen in the normal control urine A Fisher’s exact test was used to compare patients with and without CR with respect to M30 and M65 returning to normal levels.

Results

Urine IFN Levels

The phase l study design provided for a single intravesical instillation of Ad-IFNα (75 ml in 1mg/ml Syn3) with re-treatment if a complete remission (CR) was achieved at 90 days. High and prolonged dose-dependent urine IFN levels were observed in all dose levels of 1×10

10

particles/mL and above with the top concentration of 3×10

11

particles/mL producing the most increase in urine IFN levels which in certain patients were measurable up to 7 days or more (

Fig.1

). The patients who achieved a CR are shown by arrows. The difference in scale of IFN levels at each dose level should be noted. Additionally, a significant IFN urine level was measured in Pt.14 retreated 90 days after his initial treatment at the 24-hr time-point (6082 pg/ml). Six of 14 patients (43%) receiving doses that produced measurable IFNα in the urine achieved a CR at 3 months after treatment.

M30, M65 and TRAIL Levels Indicate That All Mechanisms of Ad-IFNα Produced Cell Death Occur in a Clinical Setting

Increases in both M30 and M65 were found following all 14 patients in whom increases in IFN were also seen (all patients shown in

Fig.1

). Representative examples of the changes found in M30 an M65 levels over time after treatment as well as TRAIL and IFNα levels are shown in

Table 1

. Patient # 7, who achieved a CR, had high M30 and M65 levels in his urine one day after treatment which returned to normal levels by day 4. He also had high TRAIL levels indicating that the tumor was IFNα sensitive with considerable tumor cell kill occurring because of the high and prolonged IFNα levels produced in the urine. This mechanism of tumor cell kill was likely reflected by the M30 levels in which the TRAIL related tumor cell kill cannot be distinguished in this case from the bystander produced tumor cell kill since both mechanisms cause apoptotic cell death. The initial large increase in M65 levels seen in this patient is likely the result of the direct mechanism of Ad-IFNα produced cell death, namely necrotic cancer cell kill following Ad-IFNα infection and expression in a significant portion of the tumor cells.

In contrast, patient #14, who also achieved a CR, now maintained for more than 2 years, produced no TRAIL in his urine. Therefore his tumor likely was IFN resistant and the increase seen in the urine M30 levels was likely the result of bystander factor caused cancer cell kill and was substantial. This patient had never responded to any prior intravesical therapy and would have been directed to cystectomy if not for serious co-morbidities. Again both M30 and M65 returned to normal by 10 days after treatment.

In contrast Patient # 9 did not achieve a CR. This patient had very extensive disease within the bladder at the time of treatment with Ad-IFNα/Syn3. After therapy significant levels of urine IFNα, TRAIL, M30, and M65 were obtained but the M30 and M65 levels remained high for the 14 days after treatment that urine samples were obtained. These results suggest that much tumor cell kill occurred in this patient from all three mechanisms of Ad-IFNα–produced cancer cell kill and that M30 and M65 never reached a normal level because of the extensive and persisting tumor burden present.

Correlation Between M30 and M65 Returning to Normal Levels in the Urine After Ad-IFNα Treatment and Achieving a CR at 90 days

In this phase I study 6 of 14 patients (43%) achieved a CR. All 6 patients with a CR (100%) had M30 levels in their urine that returned to normal (< 175 U/L) at day 5 or later, while 2 of 8 (25.0%) patients who did not achieve a CR had M30 levels that returned to normal levels (p=0.010). In addition five of 6 patients with a CR (83%) had M65 levels which returned to normal (< 175 U/L) at day 5 or later, while none of the 8 patients without a CR (0%) had M65 levels which returned to normal (p=0.003). Similarly, 5 of 6 patients with a CR (83.3%) had both M30 and M65 levels which returned to normal levels at day 5 or later, while none of the 8 patients without a CR (0%) had both M65 and M30 levels return to normal (p=0.003).

Discussion

Our phase l study using intravesical Ad-IFNα /Syn3 for the treatment of patients with BCG refractory nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer resulted in high and prolonged urine IFNα levels. In addition 43% of the patients with measurable urine IFNα levels achieved a CR at 90 days after treatment (

1

). Using ELISA assays to examine the levels of both caspase-cleaved (M30) and intact (M65) CK18 levels in the strong evidence was provided that significant apoptosis and necrosis occurred in each of the patient’s tumors. We believe that this represented all three mechanisms of Ad-IFNα - produced cancer cell death (

9

). The increases in M65 levels were likely from the direct tumor cell kill caused by the significant gene transfer and expression of the Ad-IFNα in many cancer cells resulting in necrotic cancer cell death, whereas the high levels of M30 observed were the result of apoptosis from both TRAIL and bystander - mediated mechanisms of Ad-IFNα - produced cancer cell death (

9

). In those patients in which significant TRAIL urine levels were seen, much of the increase in M30 levels likely was indicative of TRAIL-mediated cancer cell death caused by the high and prolonged IFNα levels produced in IFNα sensitive tumors such as in patient #7 (

Table 1

). In contrast the tumors in patients showing little or no TRAIL levels in their urine after Ad-IFNα treatment but high M30 levels most likely were IFNα resistant and the M30 increase seen reflected primarily bystander tumor cell death such as that seen in patient #14 (

Table 1

).

Since the urine high M30 and M65 levels determined within 24 hours after treatment appeared to indicate that significant tumor kill occurred in all patients we thought it would be prudent to examine whether return to normal levels in the urine over time might correlate with a better prognosis. This was indeed the case. All six patients with a CR at day 90 the M30 levels returned to normal by day 5 or later whereas this occurred in only two of eight patients who did not achieve a CR (p=0.010). Moreover five of 6 patients with a CR had M65 levels which returned to normal while none of the eight patients without a CR had M65 levels which returned to normal (p=0.003). To our knowledge this study is the first to suggest that examining M30 and M65 levels in the urine might be used as a potential surrogate biomarker of tumor cell kill and prognosis after treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with any therapeutic agent.

Although this analysis was done retrospectively it indicates that measurement of M30 and M65 levels in urine after intravesical Ad-IFNα /Syn3 treatment, particularly return to normal levels might be useful as a prognostic indicator of attaining a CR at 90 days. Such studies may therefore have clinical value in future trials. Consequently these determinations will be done in a phase lB trial planned in which intravesical Ad-IFNα /Syn3 treatment will be given on day 1 and again on day 4 to examine whether or not even higher and more prolonged urine IFNα levels can be achieved as well as whether an increase in the number of CRs can be obtained. Finally measurement of M30 and M65 levels in urine might be useful to follow tumor cell kill for other clinical studies in which tumor in the bladder is present.

#### SYN3 - Article 5: Lentiviral interferon: A novel method for gene therapy in bladder cancer
<Date>: 2022-6-10
<PMCID>: 9251210
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Approximately 70% of newly diagnosed bladder cancers (BLCAs) are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC). Conventional treatment of these tumors includes transurethral resection followed by intravesical therapy. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been the mainstay of intravesical therapy for patients with high-risk disease for decades.

1

Although this treatment achieves initial clinical responses in the majority of patients, disease recurrence and progression to a BCG-unresponsive state are common.

2

Currently, the optimal management of BCG-unresponsive disease is radical cystectomy, an invasive procedure associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality.

2

Several agents have and continue to be tested in the BCG-unresponsive setting.

3

To date, few have provided durable disease responses. Immunostimulatory gene therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy with promise to improve the durability of disease responses after intravesical therapy through immune-mediated mechanisms of tumor killing. Since the first successful therapeutic gene transfer over 30 years ago, gene therapy has evolved into an asset in our fight against cancer.

,

5

Adenoviral interferon-alpha 2b (Ad-IFNα2b) combined with a novel excipient (Syn-3), an excipient that facilitates gene transfer across the urothelium,

6

has shown promising clinical activity in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials.

7

,

8

,

9

In these studies, Ad-IFNα2b/Syn3 appeared to be well tolerated, provided sustained urinary IFNα levels, and demonstrated a 35% 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients enrolled in a phase 2 trial. Accordingly, the recently concluded phase 3 trial showed a 60% response rate at 3 months with maintenance of complete response in 51% of patients at 12 months.

9

These findings represent favorable improvement in the management of BCG-unresponsive disease compared with currently approved agents.

10

,

11

The anti-tumor efficacy of Ad-IFNα is the result of IFNα’s pleiotropic anti-tumor effects. Preclinical studies demonstrated that IFNα directly induced apoptosis in some human BLCA cells by inducing autocrine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) production.

12

Furthermore, Ad-IFNα treatment inhibited angiogenesis in human xenografts,

13

,

14

and studies conducted in immune-competent syngeneic murine models demonstrated that the immune response to IFN was mediated by activation of both innate and adaptive immunity.

15

Also, type 1 IFN signaling is important for initiating anti-tumor responses in dendritic cells.

16

While Ad-IFNα gene therapy is clinically efficacious, IFN transgene expression from this DNA viral vector is transient.

17

In contrast, lentiviral vectors can integrate their genomes into the DNA of host cells and achieve stable immunostimulatory transgene expression from both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.

18

In addition, whereas adenoviral vectors are highly immunogenic,

19

lentiviral vectors are less immunostimulatory and hosts carry lower levels of pre-existing humoral immunity. Lentiviruses have been used as vectors for transgene delivery in several clinical trials.

The studies presented here are the first to evaluate lentiviral IFNα gene therapy (LV-IFNα) for BLCA.

Results

Expression of IFNα protein and its target genes in syngeneic mouse BLCA cell lines after LV-IFNα transduction

The anti-tumor efficacy of LV-IFNα was tested in the murine BLCA cell lines BBN975 and UPPL1541, which recapitulate NMIBC, along with the carcinogen-induced cell line MB49 that is frequently used in preclinical studies.

23

GFP expression confirmed complete transduction of all cells by 48–72 h after treatment using increasing multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (2, 6, and 8;

Figure S1

). Cell lines were then treated with lentiviral control vector (LV-Ctrl) or LV-IFNα at a MOI of 2. IFNα-specific ELISA performed on cell-free supernatants collected 24 and 72 h after transduction with LV-IFNα showed robust and significantly higher IFNα protein expression in all three cell lines compared with LV-Ctrl (

Figures 1

A and 1B). Quantitative real-time PCR using RNA from transduced cells showed upregulation of the IFNα target genes IRF7, PD-L1, and TRAIL (

Figure 1

C). IRF7 expression was significantly induced in all the three cell lines but was highest in MB49 (1,564-fold), followed by BBN975 (138-fold) and UPPL1541 cells (134-fold). PD-L1 was comparably upregulated in all the three cell lines (9.165-fold in BBN975, 11.7-fold in MB49, and 16.35-fold in UPPL1541). TRAIL expression was highest in MB49 (3,677-fold), followed by UPPL1541 (282.5-fold) and BBN975 (228.3-fold).

Figure 1

Expression of murine IFNα protein and its target genes in syngeneic BLCA cell lines

(A and B) BLCA cell lines were transduced with LV-Ctrl or LV-IFNα vectors at an MOI of 2 and murine IFNα was measured in the cell-free supernatants at 24 h (A) and 72 h (B) after viral transduction. All the three cell lines showed significant expression of IFNα protein in LV-IFNα-transduced cells compared with controls. (C) qPCR analysis of IFNα target genes IRF7, PDL-1, and TRAIL in BLCA cell lines show increased expression following treatment with LV-IFNα virus when compared with control. Not significant (ns), p > 0.05; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

Cytotoxic effects of IFNα protein on BLCA cell lines after transduction with LV-IFNα

To determine whether IFNα gene therapy induced direct cytotoxic effects, we assessed cell viability of BLCA cell lines by Trypan blue dye exclusion after LV-IFNα transduction. In two of the three cell lines (MB49 and UPPL1541), viable cell counts decreased after LV-IFNα and 100 U of recombinant IFNα (rIFNα) treatment in a time-dependent manner (

Figures 2

A and 2B). This result was confirmed by MTT assay at 72 h after treatment, which demonstrated that MB49 cell proliferation was significantly lower after LV-IFNα treatment compared with LV-Ctrl (

Figure S2

A). BBN975 cells showed an initial response to LV-IFNα and 100 U rIFNa, but by 72 h, the viable cell count was comparable to controls (saline or LV-Ctrl;

Figure 2

C). Recombinant IFNα dose-response curves illustrated that BBN975 cells were resistant to rIFNα (up to 600 U/mL conc.;

Figure S2

B), whereas MB49 and UPPL1541 were sensitive at all dose levels tested (

Figures S2

C and S2D). The cytotoxicity of IFNα was mediated by cell-death pathways, as demonstrated by increased annexin V staining in MB49 and UPPL1541 cells following treatment with LV-IFNα and 100 U of rIFNα compared with controls (

Figure 2

D). Following the observation that IFNα gene therapy promoted PD-L1 expression through IFNAR1/STAT1 signaling, we performed western blot analysis on lysates from our three cell lines after treatment with LV-IFNα, rIFNα, LV-Ctrl, or vehicle, confirming that PD-L1, STAT1, and p-STAT1 were all upregulated following LV-IFNα of MB49, UPPL1541, and BBN975 (

Figure 2

E).

Figure 2

Cytotoxic effect of LV-IFNα on BLCA cell lines

(A–C) Murine cell lines were exposed to murine recombinant IFNα (rIFNα) or transduced with LV-Ctrl or LV-IFNα and cell counts were measured using Trypan blue dye exclusion method. At 72 h, MB49 (A) and UPPL1541 (B) showed significant reduction in cell counts, while BBN975 (C) showed no change in cell numbers when compared with the saline treatment. (D) At 72 h, annexin V and propidium iodide staining showed increased apoptotic cells after 100 U rIFNα or LV-IFNα treatment in MB49 and UPPL1541 cells. Percentage of apoptotic cells in BBN975 remained unchanged. ns, p > 0.05; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (E) Western blot for IFNα target genes shows increased expression of PD-L1, STAT1, and p-STAT1 in cell lines treated with 100 U rIFNα or LV-IFNα.

Cellular pathway discovery

To better understand how LV-IFNα affects global gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on cell lines treated with rIFNα, LV-Ctrl, or LV-IFNα and compared them with untreated control cells (Ctrl). Hierarchical clustering and principal-component analyses showed distinct gene expression patterns for the four groups (

Figures S3

A and S3B). To identify candidate genes contributing to IFNα-mediated effects on cell viability, we compared differentially expressed genes between the rIFNα/Ctrl and LV-IFNα/LV-Ctrl pairs and generated heatmaps using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 and fold change of 2 (

Figures 3

A–3F). The gene lists are provided in

Table S1

.

(A–F) Heatmaps of significant genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of 2) between 100 U IFNα and CTRL samples for BBN975 (A), MB49 (B), and UPPL1541 (C) and between LV-IFNα and LV-Ctrl samples for BBN975 (D), MB49 (E), and UPPL1541 (F). (G and H) Venn diagrams show significantly altered genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of 1.5) common or unique to all the three cell lines after treatment with LV-IFNα and rIFNα. (I and J) GSEA shows enrichment of interferon alpha response pathway in MB49 cells treated with LV-IFNα and rIFNα.

We then used a more inclusive fold change cutoff of 1.5 to identify genes that are commonly altered among the three cell lines tested. We generated Venn diagrams that identified 506, 603, and 869 differentially expressed genes between LV-IFNα and LV-Ctrl treatment of BBN975, MB49, and UPPL1541, respectively, with 90 genes common to all cell lines (

Figure 3

G). Similarly, 455, 730, and 88 genes were differentially expressed across the respective cell lines between 100 U rIFNα-treated and untreated controls (Ctrl), with 70 genes common to all cell lines (

Figure 3

H). The complete gene list for the three cell lines is included in

Table S2

.

To identify major pathways activated in these cells, we used the sequencing data to perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Top GSEA hallmark pathways are shown in

Table S3

. As expected, GSEA showed enrichment of the IFNα response pathway in both LV-IFNα- and rIFNα-treated MB49 cells when compared with respective controls (

Figures 3

I and 3J). GSEA of top pathways for BBN975 and UPPL1541 is shown in

Figure S3

C. We also performed ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) on differentially expressed genes between LV-IFNα- and LV-Ctrl-treated cells in all three cell lines. IFN signaling and activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors were commonly enriched in all three cell lines with a positive

Z

score whereas retinoic-acid-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway and death receptor signaling were enriched only in the IFNα-sensitive MB49 and UPPL1541 (

Figures 4

A–4C) lines. PARP proteins and TRAIL (Tnfsf10) were commonly enriched among the two apoptotic pathways, whereas DAXX was specific to the death receptor signaling pathway and was upregulated >2-fold in both MB49 and UPPL1541 cells. The complete gene list for the apoptotic pathways is provided in

Table S4

.

Figure 4

Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of canonical pathways altered after treatment with LV-IFNα

IPA analysis of significant genes (FDR cutoff 0.05 and fold change of 2) was performed to identify top candidate canonical pathways with a positive

Z

score in BBN975 (A), MB49 (B), and UPPL1541 (C). Pathways that are common to all three cell lines are indicated by green bars, and pathways common between MB49 and UPPL1541 are shown in red.

Mechanism underlying IFNα-mediated cell death

Given that our sequencing studies confirmed increased expression of TRAIL in all three cell lines (

Figure 1

C), we next evaluated caspase 8 expression, which has been shown to mediate TRAIL-dependent cell death in human BLCA cell lines.

12

Caspase 8 inhibition in MB49 (

Figures 5

A and 5B) and UPPL1541 (

Figures 5

C and 5D) partially rescued TRAIL-mediated cell death. In contrast, TRAIL-mediated cell death was not observed in BBN975, which is resistant to IFNα treatment (

Figures S4

A and S4B). Cell-surface expression of TRAIL was also increased in MB49 following treatment with LV-IFNα, which was rescued following caspase 8 inhibition (

Figure S4

C). In addition to caspase 8, in MB49 cells, we detected caspase 4 and 12 overexpression (2.0- and 2.2-fold, respectively), genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and whose expression has been linked to cell death (

Table S1

). Treatment of MB49 with tunicamycin to induce ER stress also resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner (

Figure 5

E), suggesting that MB49 cells are sensitive to ER stress induction. Treatment with IFNα together with caspase 12 inhibition partially rescued cell death in MB49 cells (

Figure 5

F). Interestingly, caspase 12 expression was downregulated in UPPL1541 (2.2-fold), suggesting that this caspase may not be involved in death of these cells (

Table S1

).

Figure 5

(B and D) Percentage of apoptotic cells measured by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining showed increased apoptosis in MB49 (B) and UPPL1541 (D) cells treated with rTRAIL and was rescued in cells treated with rTRAIL and caspase 8 inhibitor. (E) MB49 cells treated with increasing concentrations of tunicamycin, ER stress inducer, showed dose-dependent reduction in cell counts. (F) Caspase 12 inhibitor rescues cell death induced by rIFNα. (G and H) IL-6 protein expression measured by ELISA in cell-free supernatants of MB49 (G) and UPPL1541 (H) cells is shown. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

We recently reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) was important for IFN-mediated death in MB49 cells and that upregulation of IL-6 in clinical samples collected within the phase 2 trial correlated with response to IFNα gene therapy.

15

We therefore evaluated the relative expression of IL-6 in all cell lines following treatment with LV-IFNα by ELISA. IL-6 protein expression was detected at 72 h after LV-IFNα treatment in MB49 and UPPL1541 (

Figures 5

G and 5H) cells, whereas its expression was undetectable in BBN975 (data not shown). This underscores the link between the induction of IL-6 and response to IFNα.

Transduction of the bladder urothelium with LV-IFNα

We next tested the transduction efficiency of LV-IFNα after murine intravesical instillation. Following pre-administration of the excipient Syn3,

24

LV-IFNα transduction of murine urothelium was confirmed by electron microscopy (EM), with viral particles detectable inside vacuoles as early as 4 h post-instillation and persisting for up to 96 h post-instillation (

Figures 6

A–6D). Sequential instillations resulted in deeper vector penetration of the urothelium (

Figures 6

E and 6H) and apoptotic urothelial cells with shrunken cytoplasm and viral particles detected in the nuclei (

Figures 6

F and 6G). In addition to EM, we verified urothelial transduction using a lentivirus-beta-galactosidase (LV-βgal) vector (

Figure 6

I). Histological sections showed multifocal regions of βgal staining throughout the urothelium (

Figures 6

J and 6K). Finally, expression of IFNα in urine from treated mice measured by ELISA confirmed LV-IFNα transduction of and IFNα transgene expression from murine urothelium first detectable at 48 h and maintained for up to 96 h post-treatment, with protein expression of IFNα in bladder lysates peaking at 72 h post-transduction (

Figures 6

L and 6M).

Efficacy of LV-IFNα in murine model for BLCA

The anti-tumor efficacy of LV-IFNα was tested in the syngeneic MB49 murine BLCA model after intravesical administration. LV-IFNα treatment resulted in a significant improvement in median survival compared with LV-Ctrl (26 and 19 days, respectively; p < 0.001;

Figure 7

A). Histological examination of murine bladders treated with LV-IFNα revealed reduced tumor burden and decreased tumor proliferation (

Figure 7

B). To investigate intratumoral immune responses induced by LV-IFNα, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on treated tumors and confirmed decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4 cells following LV-IFNα treatment compared with LV-Ctrl treatment. CD8 cells were not significantly altered (

Figures 7

C and 7D).

In vivo

gene expression profiles induced by LV-IFNα treatment

Finally, we sequenced murine MB49 bladder tumors treated with LV-IFNα and compared their expression profile with those from LV-Ctrl and vehicle-treated bladder tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using log-transformed normalized count data. The clustered dendrogram is presented with a heatmap of variably expressed genes (top 1,500) in

Figure S5

. Using an FDR cutoff of 0.05 and log2 fold change of 1, this analysis identified 190 genes differentially expressed between LV-IFNα and LV-Ctrl treatment groups (

Figure 7

E), with the complete gene list provided in

Table S4

. Specifically, we found upregulation of several granzyme genes that are positive regulators of apoptosis in LV-IFNα-treated tumors.

25

Consistent with our

in vitro

results (

Table S4

), we also identified upregulation of caspase 12 in LV-IFNα-treated tumors. GSEA identified greater expression of apoptotic pathways in LV-IFNα-treated tumors when compared with LV-Ctrl tumors (

Figure 7

F). Immune-related pathways, such as natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and Fc-gamma-receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathways, were also enriched in LV-IFNα-treated tumors compared with LV-Ctrl.

In order to identify biomarkers associated with IFNα sensitivity, we used IPA with sequencing results from LV-IFNα-treated tumors using an FDR cutoff of 0.05 and fold change of 2. We identified 11 genes associated with cancer, inflammatory disease, and renal and urological disease (

Table 1

). The biomarker application for each of these genes, fold change (expr log ratio), and p value is listed (

Table 1

). We also evaluated expression of genes involved in cytotoxicity and immune cell recruitment. Directionality of expression of most genes involved in cytotoxicity and immune cell recruitment was consistent with their previously described functions (

Table 2

). We also evaluated the differential expression of candidate genes associated with immune cell subtypes following LV-IFNα versus LV-Ctrl or vehicle treatment (

Figures 8

A and 8B;

Table S5

). The most differentially expressed genes included SPIB (B cell marker), granzyme A and B (cytotoxic cell marker), and CD163 and MS4A4A (macrophage markers), suggesting involvement of these immune cell subtypes in IFNα-mediated cytotoxicity.

Discussion

Adenoviral-based IFNα2b gene therapy has shown promising efficacy in clinical trials. In addition to being well tolerated with a convenient dosing schedule, it achieved an RFS rate of 30.5% at 12 months.

9

Although this represents a significant improvement over the agents currently approved for BCG-unresponsive disease,

2

there remains a need to understand and improve upon intravesical IFNα gene therapy in clinical non-responders. This can be accomplished by identifying biomarkers predictive of sensitivity or resistance, by better understanding its mechanisms of action, and through the development of more efficient gene therapy vectors. We report here the initial study evaluating LV-IFNα therapy against BLCA, identifying mechanisms driving IFNα’s direct anti-tumor activity and its role(s) in immune modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Given the established clinical efficacy of IFNα gene therapy, improved intensity and duration of IFNα transgene expression following lentiviral transduction has the potential to improve the rate and durability of clinical responses.

17

Unlike adenoviruses, lentiviruses can efficiently transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells and achieve stable transgene expression, as shown in several clinical trials.

20

,

21

,

22

Additional advantages to lentiviral vectors include reduced baseline seropositivity and decreased immunogenicity following sequential administrations.

19

,

26

,

27

One significant practical limitation to the development of lentiviral vectors for clinical use was the challenge for large-scale manufacturing and purification. This limitation has been overcome using bioreactors for clinical vector production.

28

The lentiviral vector appears to be more efficient than adenoviral vectors, as higher IFN levels were generated at a much lower MOI than required with the adenovirus (data not shown). We observed little to no toxicity in normal cells infected with the adenoviral-IFNα

29

and similarly have not observed any obvious evidence of toxicity in animals treated with lenti-IFNα. However, if lenti-IFNα is developed for clinical use, more formal toxicity studies will be performed. One concern with lentiviral gene therapy is the potential risk for integration into the host’s genome and the theoretical risk for insertional mutagenesis and development of a secondary malignancy. However, the benefits of long-term IFNα production may outweigh this theoretical risk. Using the lentiviral vector, we observed robust expression of the IFN transgene in multiple cell lines

in vitro

, from murine urothelium, and from syngeneic murine bladder tumors after intravesical therapy. LV-IFNα treatment resulted in significantly improved survival in our BLCA murine models, which also correlated with upregulation of IFN-target genes, including PD-L1 and TRAIL, and multiple cellular pathways involved in cytotoxicity and immune cell recruitment.

Interestingly, despite comparable expression levels of IFNα following LV-IFNα transduction in BBN975 cells, only MB49 and UPPL1541 cells lines were sensitive to IFNα-mediated cell death. We found that this sensitivity correlated with TRAIL expression and activation of death receptor signaling and retinoic-acid-mediated apoptotic signaling pathways. Our group has previously reported TRAIL-mediated cell death in human BLCA cells mediated by caspase 8.

12

Consistent with this mechanism, we observed that caspase 8 inhibition rescued TRAIL-mediated cell death in MB49 and UPPL1541 cells after exposure to rIFNα, whereas in the resistant BBN975 cells, recombinant TRAIL failed to induce cell death. We acknowledge that this is indirect evidence, and more detailed studies are being carrying out to molecularly tease out the pathways contributing to cell death.

Molecular analyses of IFNα-treated cells clarified some of the mechanisms driving the therapeutic efficacy of and cellular resistance to LV-IFNα. Ninety IFNα response genes were upregulated in all three cell lines and included CD274 (PD-L1); chemokines, such as CXCL10 and CXCL5; GBP family proteins; IRF7; USP18; and the SLFN family known to be activated by IFN treatment.

30

When restricting the comparison to the cell lines sensitive to LV-IFNα (MB49 and UPPL1541), Tlr3, IL-15, CXCL11, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), and caspase 12 were differentially expressed. Of these, only caspase 12, which is involved in ER stress response,

31

,

32

was differentially upregulated in MB49 and downregulated in UPPL1541. Caspase 12 inhibition rescued cell death in MB49, suggesting that at least two caspases, caspase 8 and caspase 12, are involved in cell death pathways in at least a subset of BLCAs. Notably, MB49 cells were also sensitive to cell death by tunicamycin, an ER-stress-inducing compound, suggesting ER-mediated stress may be a novel mechanism of direct toxicity associated with IFNα gene therapy. It remains to be determined whether ER-mediated cellular stress responses are specific to IFNα gene therapy or mediated by lentiviral transduction.

In earlier work, we identified IL-6 as an important mediator of anti-tumor effects of IFNα in our murine MB49 subcutaneous model.

15

Here, we found that IL-6 was detectable at the protein level upon treatment with LV-IFNα in only the two sensitive cell lines MB49 and UPPL1541 and not in the resistant BBN975 line. This further supports the observation that IL-6 induction predicts response to IFNα.

15

This result was confirmed by MTT assay at 72 h after treatment, which demonstrated that MB49 cell proliferation was significantly lower in LV-IFNα-treated cells compared with LV-Ctrl (

Figure S2

A). This is supported by other studies showing STAT1-mediated upregulation of IL-6 results in apoptosis in different cell types.

33

,

34

STAT1 was upregulated and phosphorylated in all three cell lines; however, IL-6 was detectable only in the IFNα-sensitive cell lines. Taken together, IFNα-mediated cell death in culture may therefore be occurring by at least three mechanisms: (1) TRAIL-mediated cell death through caspase 8 in MB49 and UPPL1541, (2) ER-stress-induced cell death mediated by caspase 4 and 12 in MB49, and (3) IL-6 induction that induces cell death via STAT1 activation in MB49 and UPPL1541 cells.

GSEA of mouse tumors confirmed that

in vivo

efficacy resulted from activation of apoptotic pathways, natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Fc-gamma-receptor-mediated phagocytosis in LV-IFNα-treated tumors. Accordingly, IPA showed increased expression of cytotoxicity genes, such as Klra3, Gzma, Kitl, and Lamp1.

35

,

36

,

37

,

38

In addition, when immune cell populations were analyzed by whole-tumor RNA-seq, we identified enrichment of genes identifying cytotoxic immune cell populations, suggesting multiple distinct mechanisms of tumor killing (apoptosis, ER stress, and cytotoxic immune cell recruitment) may be driving the observed

in vivo

efficacy of LV-IFNα. Future studies utilizing single-cell sequencing techniques and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis will be required to conclusively identify the tumor-associated immune cell populations necessary for IFNα efficacy.

Finally, we identified three biomarkers that are part of clinically targetable molecular pathways using the biomarker filter of IPA. Aldha1, an enzyme that has been associated with stem cell properties in cancer and resistance to drugs, is upregulated and can be targeted by disulfiram and chloropropamide.

39

,

40

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been targeted in BLCA, with both cetuximab and erlotinib demonstrating effective anti-tumor activity in preclinical models.

41

Finally, PD-L1 targeting has revolutionized cancer treatment in multiple disease settings, including BLCA, and there is great clinical potential for synergistic gene therapy and checkpoint inhibitor regimens currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Biomarker-driven combination strategies may provide therapeutic benefit for patients who would otherwise fail to respond or develop resistance to IFNα monotherapy.

One concern with LV-IFNα treatment includes the potential for local toxicity. We did not identify morphological changes to the urothelium or clinical symptoms in mice treated with LV-IFNα, suggesting good local tolerance. Additional areas for future investigation include identifying optimal dosing regimens, the long-term safety and durability of lentiviral-mediated IFNα expression by transduced urothelium, and the systemic immune responses elicited against both the lentiviral vector and tumor neoantigens following intravesical LV-IFNα therapy.

In summary, our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of using lentiviral vectors for the treatment of BLCA. We also improved our mechanistic understanding of LV-IFNα-mediated cytotoxicity within BLCA cell lines and murine preclinical disease models. Future studies will directly compare the efficacy of adeno- and lentiviral-based IFNα gene therapy and the therapeutic potential of combination therapy regimens.

Materials and methods

Cell lines

Mouse urothelial cell line MB49/GFP-luciferase was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Svatek (The University of Texas Health, San Antonio), and UPPL1541 (derived from UPII PTEN/p53 null) and BBN975 (p53

+/−

mice treated with BBN) lines were a generous gift from Dr. William Kim (University of North Carolina). Cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MB49) or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (BBN975 and UPPL1541) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). For viral transduction, cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes at varying densities (MB49 50,000; UPPL1541 75,000; and BBN975 75,000). After overnight attachment, media were replaced with polybrene-containing media (4 μg/mL) and viral particles were added at desired MOI. Recombinant proteins murine IFNα (100 U/mL), TRAIL (100 ng/mL), caspase 8 inhibitor (50 mM), and pancaspase inhibitor (50 mM) were also added to seeded cells. Trypan blue dye exclusion method (ViCell, Beckman Coulter Genomics) was used to determine cytotoxicity. Annexin V allophycocyanin and propidium iodide staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88-8102-72) were used to determine percentage of apoptotic cells.

Viral vectors

FKD Therapies, University of Finland, provided lentiviral vectors (LV-GFP, LV-Ctrl, and LV-IFN). Briefly, Invitrogen’s Gateway cloning technology was used for cloning murine IFNα11 gene into pDONR211 vector to obtain pENTRY mIFNα11 and then subcloned into pSWOP shuttle vector to generate lentiviral murine IFNα11 vector. Viral particles with the vector were used to transduce HeLa cells to check efficiency of IFNα11 production. After confirmation of protein expression, the LV-IFNα was used to transduce BLCA cell lines.

qPCR analysis

RNA was extracted using Ambion miRVANA kit (AM1561) and quantified using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Twenty nanograms of RNA was used along with AgPAth-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4387391) with Taqman probes to detect IRF7 (Mm00516788_m1), PD-L1 (Mm00452054), TRAIL (Mm01283606_m1), and GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument. Comparative Ct method was used to determine relative gene expression.

42

ELISA for murine IFNα

Cell-free supernatants from cells treated with the lentiviral vectors were collected, and levels of murine IFN were measured by ELISA (PBL, 42115–1). Urine IFNα levels were measured by Cloud Clone Corp murine IFNa11 kit (SE5090Mu).

Gene expression profiling

Whole transcriptome RNA-seq was performed on Ion Gene Studio S5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was isolated from cell lines using miRVANA miRNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using manufacturer’s instructions. Quality of RNA was assessed using Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and by 4200 Tapestation (Agilent Technologies). Twenty nanograms of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome mouse gene expression chef-ready kit (A36412). cDNA was amplified and subsequently ligated with adapters and barcode. Purified libraries were quantified using Ion library quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled in a set of eight followed by enrichment on IonChef (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Enriched samples were then loaded onto Ion 540 chips and run on the Ion Gene Studio S5. Primary analysis of RNA-seq data was performed using AmpliseqRNA analysis plugin in the Torrent Suite software. Raw reads were aligned with mouse reference genome Ampliseq_Mouse_Transcriptome_V1_Reference. Raw counts and normalized reads per gene per million mapped reads (rpm) were generated, which was used for subsequent analysis. Unsupervised analysis was performed to identify outliers and assess overall similarities and differences among the samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using t tests, and FDR was estimated using the beta-uniform mixture method.

43

Electron microscopy

Samples were fixed with a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.3 and then washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and treated with 0.1% Millipore-filtered cacodylate buffered tannic acid, post-fixed with 1% buffered osmium, and stained

en bloc

with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated, and embedded in LX-112 medium. The samples were polymerized in a 60°C oven for approximately 3 days. Ultrathin sections were made using a Leica Ultracut microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate in a Leica EM Stainer, and examined in a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, USA, Peabody, MA) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were obtained using AMT Imaging System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA)

Western blotting

Cells were grown in monolayer and treated with lentiviral vectors. After 48 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped off the plates into whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]; 150 mM NaCl; 5 mM EDTA; 25 mM NaF; 1% Triton X-100; 1% NP-40; 0.1 mM Na3VO4; 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate; 1 mM PMSF) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were prepared by incubation on ice for 30–40 min with intermittent vortexing every 10 min. Protein concentration was measured (Micro BCA protein assay kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 30 μg of protein was resolved on 4%–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked in 10% mild powder in PBS and probed with antibodies against PD-L1 (AF1019, Bio-Techne), STAT1 (33–1400, Invitrogen), pSTAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology, no. 9171), and β-actin (AC-74). Species-specific secondary antibodies were used to detect proteins bands using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare).

In vivo

experiments

All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). For checking gene transfer efficiency in murine bladder, 6- to 8-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and the urethra was catheterized using a 20G angiocatheter. Bladders were flushed with PBS and instilled with lentiviral vectors/Syn3 (1 mg/mL) for 40 min. Mice were allowed to recover and returned to their cages. Urine was collected after instillations, and mouse bladders were collected for βgal staining or IFN ELISA.

Superficial bladder tumors were established using previously published protocols.

44

Briefly, after anesthetizing mice with isoflurane, mouse urethra was catheterized and instilled with 100 μL of poly(l-lysine) (PLL) (0.01 μg/mL) for 15 min. After emptying the bladder, 25,000 MB49 cells in 100 μL of HBSS were instilled into mouse bladders for 30 min. Mice were allowed to recover, and tumor burden was assessed by IVIS Spectrum

In vivo

Imaging System and Living Image Software (PerkinElmer). Mice were treated intravesically with either Syn3 (vehicle), LV-Ctrl (3 × 10

7

virus particles), or LV-IFN (3 × 10

7

virus particles, treatment), and tumor growth was monitored. Mice with significant reduction in body weight, lethargy, and hematuria were deemed as moribund and were humanely euthanized. All experiments were repeated thrice.

Histology and immunostaining

Mouse tissues were fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at the Research Histology core laboratory at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Immunostaining was performed with the specified antibodies, and species-specific horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect proteins using the 3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in Permount. Images were captured using Nanozoomer image scanner (Hamamatsu). For βgal staining, mouse bladders were fixed and stained as described earlier.

45

Statistical methods

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software. ANOVA was used to make multiple group comparisons with Tukey’s test, and results were considered significant when p < 0.05. Log rank test was used to perform the survival analysis.

INTRODUCTION

North African populations are characterized by their heterogeneous ethnic background and high rate of inbreeding. The consanguinity rate is influenced by several factors including demographic, religious, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions (Romdhane & Abdelhak,

2011

). The high rate of consanguinity has been usually associated with the emergence of autosomal recessive diseases at high frequencies (Teebi,

1994

). In fact, it was reported that among 346 genetic disorders described in Tunisia, 62.9% are autosomal recessive (Romdhane & Abdelhak,

2011

). Fanconi anemia (FA) is among the diseases for which incidence is increased by consanguinity (Hadiji et al.,

2012

), hence allowing founder ancestral mutations such as exon 15 deletion in

FANCA

(OMIM #607139) gene to be frequently observed (Amouri et al.,

2014

). Indeed, more than 142 patients with a consanguinity rate of 86% have been registered in the Tunisian Fanconi Anemia Registry (TFAR) (Hadiji et al.,

2012

). As the Tunisian population structure is very similar to that of neighboring countries, FA prevalence is expected to be just as high in these countries. In Egypt, among 48 patients clinically suspected to have FA, the diagnosis has been cytogenetically confirmed for 31 cases for whom the consanguinity rate reaches 97% (Temtamy et al.,

2007

). Jewish FA patients have been reported mostly from Morocco and Tunisia (Tamary et al.,

2000

).In Libya, the consanguinity rate reaches 37.6% in Benghazi (Abudejaja et al.,

1987

). Unfortunately, epidemiological studies for numerous cases including FA are lacking due to an unstructured health system.

FA is a rare genetic disease characterized by variable congenital defects, hematological problems, and cancer. A large clinical heterogeneity is associated with this syndrome. Indeed, the clinical manifestation differs from one patient to another and it is due to several factors that remain unknown. As the biological diagnosis of FA relies on double‐stranded DNA breaks in the chromosomes of FA patients when cultured with DNA interstrand cross‐linking agents, such as diepoxybutane (DEB) (Auerbach,

2003

) or mitomycin C (MMC) (Cervenka, Arthur, & Yasis,

1981

), all FA genes are known to play a role in double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks repair. In the absence of a clear phenotype–genotype correlation, molecular diagnosis of FA is complicated. Until now, 21 responsible FA genes have been defined (Mamrak, Shimamura, & Howlett,

2017

). The gravity of this disease justifies an adequate genetic counselling and prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which requires precise identification of the pathogenic mutations.

Here, we report on a Libyan FA child who was addressed with a suspicion of FA but further investigations showed co‐occurrence of three different rare genetic and clinical entities.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

2.1

Ethical compliance

This study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the ethical standards of the Institut Pasteur de Tunis Institutional Review Board (Registration number IRB00005445, FWA00010074). Informed consent of the legal representatives of the patient was obtained.

2.2

Clinical and genealogical description

A female patient S156‐V‐2, aged 4 years and born to young healthy second‐degree cousins was addressed to our department in Institut Pasteur de Tunis (IPT) for FA cytogenetic test (Figure

1

a). Physical examination revealed: growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, beaked nose, thin lips, upper lip overhanging the lower one, café au lait spots, and severe skeletal deformities including bilateral radial agenesis with absent thumbs (Figure

1

b). The eldest sister V‐1 was healthy. The mother had a history of two additional pregnancies, the first resulted in a spontaneous miscarriage while the second was marked by aneonatal death due to congenital malformations mainly marked by severe polydactyly; however, no cytogenetic nor molecular studies have been performed.

2.3

Chromosomal breakage test

A standard chromosomal breakage test with MMC in peripheral blood cultures has been conducted to assess chromosomal hypersensitivity to clastogenic agents as previously detailed (Talmoudi et al.,

2013

).

2.4

Genetic analysis

After obtaining a written consent from the parents, EDTA‐blood samples were received and genomic DNA was extracted applying the standard salting‐out method (Miller, Dykes, & Polesky,

1988

). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using 5 μg of the genomic DNA sample. Sanger sequencing was carried out to confirm the mutations identified by WES. All PCR products were directly sequenced on an ABI 3,130 automated sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, CA). Sequences were then compared to published sequences of the

FANCJ

gene (NM_032043.2),

EFCAB6

gene (NM_022785.4), and

ERCC6

gene (NM_000124.4) using the Sequencher 5.0 software program package (Gene Codes, MI, and USA).

2.4.1

Prescreening of exon 15 deletion in

FANCA

gene

The

FANCA

gene is the most frequent gene being responsible of almost 90% of FA in Tunisian (Bouchlaka et al.,

2003

), Algerian, and Libyan patients (unpublished data); thus the patient reported here was initially screened using a PCR‐based approach for exon 15 deletion in

FANCA

gene which is a common founder mutation in Southern Tunisia (Amouri et al.,

2014

) and among patients from Libya and Algeria (unpublished data).

2.4.2

Homozygosity mapping

Taking into account the recessive trait of FA and the consanguinity of the index case, we applied homozygosity mapping strategy to look for regions of homozygosity by descent and consequently locate the responsible gene(s) with the causative mutation(s). Whole exome Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype data from the index case and her parents were analyzed for the presence of runs of homozygosity (McQuillan et al.,

2008

) through the Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) tool from PLINK v1.06 (http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink). We kept the default settings of the “homozygous” command. Then, we applied the FSuite software for better visualization and determination of these ROHs (Gazal,

2014

).

2.4.3

Whole exome sequencing

In order to define disease‐relevant variants, we realized WES for the index case S156‐V‐2 and her parents. WES and bioinformatics' analysis were performed by Oxford Gene Technology (OGT; London, UK). Briefly, samples were prepared according to Agilent's SureSelect Protocol Version 1.2 (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA). Obtained libraries were pooled prior to sequencing with each sample at a final concentration of 10nM. Paired‐end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using TruSeq v3 chemistry. Read files (Fastq format) were generated from the sequencing platform via the manufacturer's proprietary software. Burrows‐Wheeler Aligner's sample algorithm, for paired‐end–short read alignment (BWA‐short version 0.6.2) (Li & Durbin.,

2009

), was used for mapping to the human genome (hg19/b37). Sequence alignment Map (SAM) was converted to Binary Alignment Map (BAM) using Sam tools version 0.1.18. (Li et al.,

2009

). Further BAM files processing was performed using Picard tools version 1.89 (

) and Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 1.6 (

https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/version-history.php)

(McKenna et al.,

2010

), which was also used for variant calling and variant filtering. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) novelty was determined against dbSNP137. Candidate variants were analyzed by a range of web‐based bioinformatic tools like the EnsEMBL SNP Effect Predictor (

) and VarioWatch (

RESULTS

In our study, we investigated at clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular levels a patient with a suspicion of FA. The cytogenetic instability assessment revealed a high frequency of chromosomal breakages (8.64 breaks/cell) compared to control (0.062 breaks/cell) (Figure

2

a). In addition to clinical features, these results confirmed the diagnosis of FA. The karyotype analysis and the standard chromosomal breakage test showed 46,XY in all analyzed mitoses. The father IV‐1 and the mother IV‐2 had both a normal karyotype (46,XY; 46,XX, respectively). This incidental discovery is suggesting sex reversion (Figure

2

b).

After excluding exon 15 deletion in

FANCA

gene, WES data analysis allowed identification of a nonsense mutation c.[2392C>T];[2392C>T]: p.[Arg798*];[Arg798*] at homozygous state in exon 17 of

BRIP1/FANCJ

gene which is responsible for FA. Homozygosity mapping showed the presence of two IBD‐ROH (Identity by descent‐Runs of homozygosity) (Figure

3

). The first one is located in chromosome 17 and contains the

BRIP1/FANCJ

gene, thus supporting the involvement of the identified mutation in the FA phenotype. The second ROH is located in chromosome 10 and includes the

ERCC6

gene. By filtering pathogenic variants from WES data, we identified a novel missense mutation c.[4114G>A];[4114G>A]: p.[Gly1372Arg];[Gly1372Arg] at homozygous state occurring in exon 21 of

ERCC6

which is the major gene underlying cerebro‐oculo‐facio‐skeletal (COFS) syndrome. By analyzing 37 genes reported as being involved in DSD (Kyriakou, Lucas‐Herald, McGowan, Tobias, & Ahmed,

2015

) and the genes they interact with, a novel compound heterozygous mutation in

EFCAB6

gene, a nonsense and a missense mutations c.[322C>T];[4489C>T]: p.[Arg108*];[Arg1497Trp] affecting respectively exon 4 and exon 32 were identified. Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of all the variants identified above by the analysis of parents samples (Figure

4

). In fact, the nonsense mutation has been inherited from the mother while the missense mutation has been inherited from the father. Thus, these results confirmed that the two compound heterozygous variants are in trans.

DISCUSSION

We report a rare case of comorbidity involving three rare autosomal recessive diseases namely, FA, DSD, and COFS, affecting the same individual. Genetic analysis, using homozygosity mapping and WES, showed that patient S156‐V‐2 is carrying a nonsense mutation, p.[Arg798*];[Arg798*] in

BRIP1/FANCJ

gene, causing FA, a compound heterozygous mutation in

EFCAB6

gene, p.[Arg108*];[Arg1497Trp] causing DSD and a missense mutation, p.[Gly1372Arg];[Gly1372Arg] in

ERCC6

gene responsible for COFS syndrome.

BRIP1 (BRCA1 Interacting Protein C‐Terminal Helicase 1), is a Fanconi anemia gene (

FANCJ)

(Litman et al.,

2005

) that functions in DNA damage repair (Bridge, Vandenberg, Franklin, & Hiom,

2005

; Litman et al.,

2005

).

Homozygous mutations in

BRIP1/FANCJ

result in FA phenotype (Kumaraswamy & Shiekhattar,

2007

), while heterozygous truncating mutations are associated with a moderate risk of breast cancer (Levran et al.,

2005

; Seal et al.,

2006

; Walsh & King,

2007

).

The most widespread pathogenic mutation identified in

BRIP1/FANCJ

is p.[Arg798*]. This mutation has been initially described in 2005 to be associated with a lack of BRIP1 expression and hence a deficiency of double‐stranded DNA breaks repair by homologous recombination (Levitus et al.,

2005

; Levran et al.,

2005

; Litman et al.,

2005

). This truncating mutation has been found in patients presenting a severe aplastic anemia from diverse populations, suggesting that it is either a relatively ancient founder mutation or a recurrent one (Levitus et al.,

2005

; Seal et al.,

2006

). The p.[Arg798*] mutation is common in Saudi FA patients(40% of all FA patients),compared to only 2% among FA European patients (Ghazwani et al.,

2016

; Levitus et al.,

2005

). It is notable that our patient presents more severe skeletal deformities than all previously described patients having this mutation, suggesting that they might result from the mutation identified in the

ERCC6

gene (ERCC excision repair 6, chromatin remodeling factor) which is involved in transcription‐coupled excision repair (Meira et al.,

2000

). All mutations identified in this gene are associated with Cockayne syndrome type B and COFS syndrome. COFS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, cataract, microphthalmia, distinctive facial dysmorphism and arthrogryposis (Lowry, MacLean, McLean, & Tischler,

1971

; Preus & Fraser,

1974

). This disorder is genetically heterogeneous and, at present, four different genes called excision repair cross‐complementing genes (

ERCC6, ERCC2, ERCC5,

and

ERCC1

) are responsible for this phenotype (Jaakkola et al.,

2010

). Here, we report a novel mutation in

ERCC6

gene that might explain all or at least a part of the facial dysmorphism and skeletal malformations observed in our patient. Interestingly, such complex overlapping features including FA and other DNA‐repair disorders were described in a recent study that reported a malfunction of the nuclease

ERCC1

‐

ERCC4

(

XPF

) resulting in complex clinical manifestations comprising

Xeroderma pigmentosum

(XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and Fanconi anemia (FA) (Kashiyama et al.,

2013

). In another study, mutations in

ERCC4

were described to be involved in FA but without the features of CS and XP (Bogliolo et al.,

2013

). Before Kashiyama's report of the

ERCC1

mutant patient with COFS syndrome, Jaspers et al. (

2007

) had reported a first case of

ERCC1

F231L mutation with mild NER deficiency, heterogeneous congenital COFS syndrome, and severe pre‐ and postnatal growth failure. This was followed by characterization of the loss of

ERCC1‐XPF

optimal interaction by Faridounnia et al. (

2015

). COFS syndrome has been mainly reported to be linked to

CSB

,

XPD

, or

XPG

mutations (Drury et al.,

2014

; Laugel et al.,

2010

; Nouspikel,

2009

; Powell, Meira, & Friedberg,

2000

). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that defects occur in both of

ERCC4

and

ERCC1

can result in either CS or the combined XP‐CS‐FA phenotype (Kashiyama et al.,

2013

).In this regard, the question that arises is that whether the severe skeletal abnormalities result from the

FANCJ

or

ERCC6

mutation. More pronounced skeletal deformities observed in our patient supports the involvement of the

ERCC6

mutation. Furthermore, the predicted result from in silico tools (SIFT = 0.005, Varsome = 0.9994, MutationTaster = 1) showed that the pathogenic effect for the

ERCC6

mutation is the second hypothesis.

Despite being consanguineous, the patient S156‐V‐2 has two novel deleterious mutations at compound heterozygous state that are responsible for sex reversion. DSD diseases are known to be clinically very heterogeneous. Thus, a careful neonatal exam is crucial (Lee, Houk, Ahmed, & Hughes,

2006

). In our case study, the inspected DSD was detected by karyotype analysis and confirmed by WES.

Absence or reduced expression of the

EFCAB6

gene, that encodes DJBP, leads to a decrease in the Androgen receptor (AR) transcription activity (Niki, Takahashi‐Niki, Taira, Iguchi‐Ariga, & Ariga,

2003

). It has been suggested that DJBP plays a role in spermatogenesis or fertilization (Niki et al.,

2003

). Besides, the DJBP protein is a part of more than 70 different binding proteins that interact with AR for its downstream action (Gottlieb, Beitel, Nadarajah, Paliouras, & Trifiro,

2012

). Indeed, defects in the androgen receptor gene in 46,XY individuals affect the androgen‐dependent male sexual development, leading to an androgenin sensitivity syndrome (AIS) (Quigley et al.,

1995

; Sultan et al.,

2002

).The resulting phenotype exhibit sa genetic makeup of a male with the physical traits of a female, as observed in the present case.

The co‐occurrence of more than one genetic disease affecting one individual and/or different members from the same family is known as comorbidity. This phenomenon seems to be frequently reported in highly inbred populations as described by Romdhaneet al. (

2016

), where 75 disease associations were reported. While Libyan population is characterized by its heterogeneous ethnic background and high rate of consanguinity (Abudejaja et al.,

1987

), the report of multiple disease associations in the same individual could be expected. The main challenging consequence of comorbidity is undoubtedly the possibility of misdiagnosis especially when phenotypes are extremely rare and overlapping as one phenotype could be hidden by another (Romdhaneet al.,

2016

).

The initial diagnosis based on clinical and cytogenetic findings for FA and DSD was considered as an important starting point for further molecular approaches in order to characterize each disease (Figure

5

). During the last decade, next‐generation sequencing and particularly WES has become an undeniable and a valuable tool for the identification of genes underlying rare monogenic diseases and in case of comorbidity as described here (Cullinane et al.,

2011

; Chong al.,

2015

; Gilissen, Hoischen, Brunner, & Veltman,

2012

; Margolin et al.,

2013

). Targeted gene sequencing could be an alternative but it will not identify mutations in hitherto unknown genes. Multiple strategies have been used to prioritize WES variants including homozygosity mapping which was successful in the partial elucidation of the molecular etiology of our patient's phenotype (Becker et al.,

2011

; Erlich et al.,

2011

; Gilissen et al.,

2012

). The autozygosity analysis revealed the causative mutations for FA and COFS phenotypes, whereas it has not been effective to characterize the genetic basis of DSD traits. A candidate gene strategy for variant filtering was adopted to identify the compound heterozygous mutations in the

EFCAB6

gene. This highlights that the allelic homogeneity is not always the rule even in highly inbred population (Romdhane & Abdelhak,

2011

).The challenge for clinical diagnostic laboratory is no longer a problem of detection, but of interpretation and analysis of the huge amount of generated variants in the context of the patient's phenotype. This is well‐illustrated through the present case. Indeed, the presence of the

BRIP1

mutation is very challenging for genetic counsellors as they should take into consideration not only the FA risk for the descendants but also the breast cancer risk for the ascendants.

Figure 5

Strategy of cytogenetic and molecular investigation

In conclusion, the present study represents the first case with the combination of three rare entities: Fanconi anemia (FA) associated with disorders of sex development (DSD) and cerebro‐oculo‐facial‐skeletal syndrome (COFS). It also illustrates that using a combined approach, homozygosity mapping and WES represent a rapid and powerful tool that allows us to reveal pathogenic mutations in autosomal recessive inherited diseases, especially in consanguineous families. Thus, the output is considered as a support for clinical and genetic characterization of comorbid phenotypes and then contributes to a better and accurate health‐care management.

#### EFCAB6 - Article 2: The transcriptional signature associated with human motile cilia
<Date>: 2020-7-2
<PMCID>: 7331728
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Cilia and flagella are related organelles that facilitate an array of cellular functions. In eukaryotes, the core structural components of cilia includes: the

axoneme

, a microtubular protrusion from the cell surface composed of an array of microtubules; a

centrosomal core

, comprised of a mother (basal body) and daughter centriole

1

,

2

anchored to the base of the axoneme, and the centriole-associated distal and sub-distal appendages

3

. Generally, cilia can be subdivided into non-motile primary cilia, in which nine microtubules constitute the axoneme (9 + 0) and motile cilia, characterised by an additional central pair of microtubules (9 + 2)

4

–

6

. Primary cilia are found on most cell types, where their principal role is as a sensor of the cell’s microenvironment

7

. In contrast, motile cilia are restricted to specific cell populations. Flagellum function as a single large ‘propeller’ and in eukaryotes are found exclusively on spermatocytes where they drive cell motility. Other motile cilia are found in large numbers on the apical surface of certain types of epithelial cells, where their co-ordinated beating displaces the luminal contents over the epithelial surface, e.g. the clearance of mucus in the respiratory tract. Whilst there are a set of core proteins common to all cilia, there are also structural and regulatory elements unique to motile cilia which underpin their distinct functional activity

8

,

9

.

Motile cilia play a vital role in human development and homeostasis, and there is a growing list of ciliopathies (cilia-related diseases) associated with mutations of ciliary assembly proteins and protein components of these organelles. These include defects in left-right patterning during embryogenesis

10

, infertility

11

, asthma

12

and hydrocephalus

13

. Perhaps the most notable and well-characterised ciliopathy is primary ciliary dyskinesia, an autosomal recessive disorder which has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10,000

5

,

14

. Causative mutations leading to primary ciliary dyskinesia include those in genes encoding the motile ciliary components of radial spokes (

RSPH1

,

RSPH9

and

RSPH4A

)

15

,

16

, dynein arms, specifically the outer dynein arm (

DNAI1

,

DNAI2

and

DNAH11

)

17

–

19

, proteins involved in their assembly (

CCDC103, LRRC6

and

ZMYND10

)

20

–

22

and the key transcriptional regulator of motile ciliogenesis

FOXJ1

23

. Patients carrying mutations in these genes are often treated for respiratory symptoms, including chronic respiratory infections, due to their inefficient clearance of mucus from the lungs

24

,

25

.

There have already been considerable efforts made to characterise the molecular components of cilia. FOXJ1 and the RFX family of genes have been identified as the key transcription factors which regulate motile ciliogenesis, which in turn, depending on species, have shown to be regulated by the Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signalling pathways

9

. Moreover, in conjunction with other transcriptional regulators, such as HNF1B and SOX5, further ciliary diversity is introduced for mechanosensory renal cilia and bronchiolar cilia, respectively

26

,

27

. Proteomic profiling studies have sought to define the components of motile cilia by dysregulating such transcriptional regulators and analysing the proteome of isolated cilia preparations using mass spectrometry

28

–

32

. Each of these studies has produced a list of cilia-associated proteins and accordingly a number of databases have been established. The most relevant to the study of human cilia include:

CentrosomeDB

, a set of human (and

Drosophila

) genes encoding proteins that are localized in the centrosome, either as centrosome constituents or as centrosome visitors

33

;

CilDB

a database dedicated to proteins involved in centrioles, centrosomes, basal bodies, cilia and flagella in eukaryotes

34

;

SysCilia

a curated list of cilia genes many of which are associated with disease

35

; and

CiliaCarta

which employs a naive Bayesian classifier to predict cilia candidate genes across a diverse set of datasets

36

. These resources list between 303 and 3,376 genes and have greatly broadened our understanding of the complexity of cilia while attempting to define the role of these genes in the context of development, ciliogenesis and ciliopathies.

Here we have sought to provide a consensus human motile cilia gene signature conserved across known motile cilia containing tissues and compare it with the relevant databases. We have used a network deconvolution approach to define gene coexpression clusters containing the transcriptional regulator

FOXJ1

37

using transcriptomics data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)

38

project for human tissues known to possess motile ciliated cells. In support of these analyses, we have also examined various lines of evidence in order to validate the set of genes identified. These include a comparison with cilia and centrosomal databases mentioned above, studies of their expression profile across motile and primary cilia containing cells and tissues, and a number of new expression studies examining several poorly characterised genes identified by this work, namely

ARMC3

,

EFCAB6

,

FAM183A

,

MYCBPAP

,

RIBC2

and

VWA3A

. Overall the study proposes a set of motile cilia cilia-associated associated genes that are tightly coexpressed across tissues, including certain but not all cilia-associated centrosomal genes previously identified. The signature genes have been summarised graphically based on their function and/or known localization.

Results

Derivation of the human motile cilia signature

The GTEx RNA-Seq (v7) dataset is the largest transcriptomics data resource for non-pathological human tissues currently available and was used here to derive a human motile cilia gene signature. Data derived from tissues known to contain cell populations possessing motile cilia, i.e. ependymal cells in brain regions likely to adjoin the cerebrospinal fluid-filled ventricular space (n = 863), bronchial epithelia of the lung (n = 427), spermatocytes in testis (n = 259) and tubal epithelial cells in fallopian tube/endocervix (n = 12) were downloaded; in total this represented tissue RNA-Seq data from 1,561 samples derived from 566 donors (Fig.

1

). To identify genes associated with motile cilia, we examined coexpressing genes, i.e. genes which have a similar expression profile across samples from the same tissue. This similarity was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient and highly correlated genes were used to construct a gene correlation network (GCN). The network comprises of nodes representing genes, and those correlated beyond the selected threshold are connected within the network. Subsequently, the network was subjected to network cluster analysis to define groups of coexpressed genes, and in the case of each tissue GCN, those that clustered with

FOXJ1

(Table

S1

).

FOXJ1

associated clusters ranged in size from 597 to 6,126 genes. Such variation in the size of the motile cilia cluster across tissues is likely explained by a varying number of samples and the different tissue biology, e.g. the expression landscape of the testis is dominated by transcriptional signal associated with spermatogenesis, making the flagellum-specific gene module difficult to separate from other sperm-associated gene clusters

39

. 1,517 genes from the different tissue derived signatures overlapped with one another (Fig.

2B

), and for the final signature we considered only the 248 genes present in all tissue-derived gene lists. However, we acknowledge that the extended list, i.e. 479 genes found in three of the four motile cilia tissue clusters contains many additional validated cilia genes and therefore is likely to contain many other novel motile cilia-associated genes (Table

S1

).

Comparison with database genes and their expression profiles across cells/tissue

Enrichment analysis of the 248 gene signature was conducted for GO terms, pathways, gene families, transcription factor binding sites, and human phenotypes (Table

S2

). Enriched gene families included components of the ‘dynein regulatory complex’ (

q

value = 2.2 × 10

−15

), ‘axonemal, dyneins’, (

q

value = 3.2 × 10

−13

) and ‘tektins’ (

q

value = 1.4 × 10

−7

), with the corresponding enrichment of biological processes such as ‘cilium movement’ (

q

value = 3.4 × 10

−52

), ‘cilium organization’ (

q

value = 5.1 × 10

−40

) and ‘cilium-dependent cell motility’ (

q

value = 2.7 × 10

−26

). Additionally, binding sites for RFX1 and MIF were also found to be enriched for these genes (

q

value < 10

−7

). Human disease phenotypes associated with disorders of motile cilia included ‘abnormal respiratory motile cilium morphology’ (

q

value = 1.2 × 10

−24

), ‘situs inversus totalis’ (

q

value = 3.4 × 10

−21

), ‘bronchiectasis’ (

q

value = 1.5 × 10

−13

), and ‘male infertility’ (

q

value = 3.7 × 10

−13

). Signature genes associated with human ciliopathies were identified from OMIM, a knowledgebase of human genetic disorders

40

. The database listed 33 of the signature genes linked to human ciliopathies, majority being primary ciliary dyskinesia (Table

S2

). To further investigate the ciliary/centrosomal association of the signature genes we first conducted a literature search on all signature genes. Of the genes identified, the literature supported 133 (54%) as having direct experimental evidence supporting their spatial localization or functional association with cilia (Table

S1

). A further 87 (35%) genes were found associated with cilia through coexpression analysis but without any direct evidence of their localization within ciliary structures. For 28 genes (11%) no prior association with cilia could be identified.

We then sought to examine the signature’s overlap with public databases of cilia/centrosome proteins. Including the signature reported here, a total of 4,333 genes have been implicated previously with cilia and/or centrosomes. These include the CentrosomeDB

33

, CilDB

34

, CiliaCarta

36

and SysCilia (gold standard)

35

(Fig.

2A

and Table

S3

). There were only four genes which were common to all the databases and the derived signature (

DNAAF1

,

FOXJ1

,

KIF24

, and

MAK

). In support of our literature search, the majority of the signature genes (196 genes) overlapped with genes listed in CilDB, including well known motile cilia genes such as members of the dynein regulatory complex (

DRC1

,

TCTE1

and

IQCD

), axonemal dynein (

DNAH2

,

DNALI1

and

DNAI1

) and tektin gene family (

TEKT1

,

TEKT2

, and

TEKT4

), whilst also included genes with poor evidence supporting an association with cilia, e.g.

MYCBPAP

,

ARMC3

and

EFCAB6

. Relative to the databases, 52 genes were found to be unique to the current study and included genes not associated with human motile cilia previously, e.g.

FAM183A

and

VWA3A

. By contrast, 84 genes recorded by all database resources were absent from the derived signature. Upon inspection, these largely represented genes associated with the cell cycle

41

and ciliary assembly and maintenance, e.g. members of the centrin family (

CETN1

,

CETN2

and

CETN3

), BBSome complex members (

BBS1

,

BBS4

,

BBS5

and

BBS7

) and IFT genes (

IFT20

,

IFT74

and

IFT81

)

42

.

As a further analysis, we examined the global expression patterns of all signature genes and those recorded in databases for their expression across all 51 tissue types in the GTEx resource. GCN analysis was again used to visualise and explore the expression profile of signature and database genes across human tissues (Fig.

2B–D

). Cluster analysis was used to broadly group genes together based on their underlying expression pattern (Fig.

2B

). Highlighting the genes from each database showed them in each case to be distributed across the network. In contrast to the distribution of signature genes which were far more localized. This is indicative of their tight coexpression across all tissues (Fig.

2C

), attributed by their relatively high expression in tissues known to have motile ciliated cells (Fig.

2D

). Conversely, genes for each of the databases were scattered throughout the graph suggesting that they had very different expression profiles, ranging from a broad expression across all tissues as represented by cluster 1, to being highly expressed in certain tissues such as blood (cluster 3) or brain (cluster 4). Additionally, cluster 3 included many immune genes, e.g. associated with MHC class 1 and 2, TLR receptors and TNF family of genes (Table

S3

). As a more direct comparator, the expression of signature genes was examined in single cell RNA-Seq data derived from the mouse brain and lung (Fig.

3

). Here motile ciliated ependymal and bronchial cells, respectively, showed a significantly higher average expression of signature genes (

q

value < 0.001) when compared to other cell types, again supporting their specific association with motile cilia possessing cells.

The localisation of candidate proteins in motile ciliated tissue

In order to provide an additional level of validation for the 248 signature genes, we examined the immunohistochemistry (IHC) data in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) resource

43

in tissues containing motile ciliated cells (Fig.

4

, Table

S1

). Based on our own criteria (independent of the confidence scores set by HPA), genes were placed into three groups: high confidence genes (n = 119, 48%) were those where positive staining for the cilia/centrosome was observed in at least one tissue with no staining of other structures. Medium confidence (n = 50, 20%) was assigned to genes where the protein was positively stained for in cilia/centrosomes, but the data also showed staining of other structures. Finally, for 79 (32%) genes no data was available or no apparent staining was observed on the sections, and they were designated as being unsupported by this approach. In no cases did we observe any evidence of the specific staining of non-ciliated cells.

The final column consists of new ISH staining performed in choroid plexus sections from chicken embryos (stage 35).

Experimental validation of uncharacterised cilia-associated genes

After collating the results of the above analyses, six genes with little evidence in the literature of an association with cilia were selected for further investigation. This included five high confidence genes based on our assessment of the HPA IHC data:

ARMC3, FAM183A, MYCBPAP

,

RIBC2

and

VWA3A

, and

EFCAB6

which had no HPA data associated with it. For these genes, we examined localised gene expression through RNA

in situ

hybridisation (ISH) data from the Allen mouse brain atlas

44

. Furthermore, we performed ISH analyses on sections of the choroid plexus from chicken embryos (stage 35) looking for staining in ependymal cells (Fig.

4

and

S1

) which have motile cilia

45

. In all cases, positive staining for motile ciliated cells was observed in the mouse brain, however, ISH staining of ependymal cells lining the choroid plexus in the chickens was only observed in the cases of

EFCAB6, FAM183A

and

MYCBPAP

.

As a graphical summary of this work, we sought to categorize all motile cilia signature genes based on their known association with cilia (Fig.

5

, Table

S1

). The figure broadly categorized genes into different levels of confidence based on literature mining, including those with a known localization (grey box), cilia-association but no localization (green box) and those with no association at all (yellow box). Genes examined experimentally here are highlighted in blue and those associated with human ciliopathies have red hash symbols.

Genes with evidence for their localization within the context of cilia are grouped in grey boxes. Genes associated with cilia, but lacking any localization evidence are grouped in the green box. Those without any previous evidence of an association with cilia are grouped in the yellow box, with those being scored high or medium confidence genes based on our analyses being marked with an asterisk. Additionally, genes examined experimentally in this study are highlighted in blue and those linked to human ciliopathies based on OMIM

40

are marked with a red hash sign.

Discussion

Motile cilia are a distinct class of cilia. They are characterized by a 9 + 2 configuration of central microtubules, radial spokes and dynein arms, along with specialized proteins involved in their assembly. Together, the microtubules and associated molecular motors allow cilia to beat in an ATP-dependent manner

46

. They are vital in cell motility, embryonic patterning, fertilization and the movement of luminal contents over epithelial surfaces. Mutations in the components of these organelles result in a wide range of disorders termed as ciliopathies. Studies in humans and model organisms have identified thousands of proteins as potentially being involved in cilia biogenesis, maintenance and assembly, and the results of these studies are presented in a number of databases, i.e. CentrosomeDB

33

, CilDB

34

, CiliaCarta

36

and SysCilia (gold standard)

35

. One of the challenges in identifying candidate genes or proteins specific to motile cilia is the fact that many components are involved in other cellular processes or structures. For example, centrosomal replication is associated with cell division, during which many components are upregulated

41

, and primary cilia, which contain many of the same proteins, are present in most cell types.

Here we have attempted to harness the power of GCN’s and employ the principle of ‘guilt-by-association’ to identify genes specifically associated with motile cilia. This is based on the fact that genes specifically associated with a given cell type or biological process frequently vary in expression with their relative abundance or activity within a sample and consequently across a large sample set the expression of these genes is tightly correlated. This approach has been used previously to identify genes associated with specific cell populations and processes, from tissue and cell-level transcriptomics data

47

–

50

. Here we analysed the brain, lung and the female reproductive tract, all of which contain populations of multi-ciliated cells which function to move luminal contents (cerebrospinal fluid, mucus) over the epithelial surface. In addition, we examined the testis, where cilia proteins are associated with the flagellum of sperm, a fundamentally different type of motile cilia but comprised of many of the same molecular components. In the current study, we first identified genes from each of the selected tissues which co-clustered with

FOXJ1

, a key transcriptional regulator of the motile ciliogenic program

37

,

51

,

52

. In the case of the brain and lung, a clear transcriptional module associated with multiciliated epithelial cells was defined due to the marked variation in the abundance of these cell populations across the samples. For the female reproductive tract and testis, however, such modules were harder to define accurately, as there were either only a few samples available and with flagellum-related genes being strongly associated with genes involved in spermatogenesis

39

, respectively. To circumvent these limitations and filter out any cell type-specific genes, we compared the gene clusters from each tissue to arrive at a consensus signature of 248 genes. It should be noted, however, that the list of genes associated with three of the tissue clusters (an additional 231 genes) also contained many other known cilia proteins and therefore by inference genes encoding other uncharacterised cilia components (Table

S1

).

Validation of the gene signature included enrichment analyses, annotation based on a literature review and cilia-associated databases, and exploration of other resources describing the cellular expression of genes and proteins, confirmed the majority to be known components of motile cilia or associated regulatory systems (summarised in Fig.

5

). The binding site for the transcriptional factor RFX1, a member of the RFX gene family

53

, was enriched. This gene has shown to be involved in development, based on a mouse knockout model and regulates the basal body-associated protein ALMS1, defects in which cause Alström syndrome ciliopathy

54

,

55

. Furthermore, another member, RFX2 has been proposed to work in conjunction with FOXJ1 to regulate cilia gene expression, including RIBC2 also identified and examined in this study

56

,

57

. However, of the RFX family only RFX3 was found in three of the tissue-derived motile cilia signatures, making it a likely candidate in regulating motile-ciliogenesis, an observation supported by a recent study

58

. In addition, the transcriptional binding site for MIF was also enriched in signature gene promoters. MIF is known to affect cell motility through the regulation of microtubule formation

59

,

60

.

The signature genes were also cross-referenced with the four cilia/centrosome gene databases; CentrosomeDB

33

, CilDB

34

, CiliaCarta

36

and SysCilia (gold standard)

35

databases. The majority (79%) of genes in the signature were corroborated by one or more of the databases. Notably, many well-known primary cilia genes involved in ciliary assembly and signalling and listed by the databases were absent from the signature. This included members of the BBSome complex, IFT chain

61

,

62

and many associated with the centrosome. As known components of primary cilia, these genes are regulated through the stages of cell cycle and are ubiquitously expressed across cell types, and would therefore be expected to have a different expression profile in the tissues examined relative to the genes coexpressing with

FOXJ1

. To explore the expression of signature and database genes across tissues, GCN analysis was used for all the 51 tissues from the GTEx project. Interestingly, although the signature was derived from separate analyses of individual tissues, in general their coexpression was highly conserved across the 51 tissue types, being highly expressed in motile ciliated tissues relative to others. Interestingly, these also included a number of centrosomal genes indicative of a specialised centrosomal system for motile cilia assembly and function. Genes listed by the various databases coexpressing with those of the signature included known motile cilia components like dyneins (

DNAH3

,

DNAH7

, and

DNAH8

) and members of the α-tubulin gene family (

TUBA3D

,

TUBA3E

, and

TUBA3C

)

63

,

64

. In contrast, analysis of databases showed genes within a given database to be distributed across the GCN, and exhibit little evidence of co-expression, suggestive of representing different biology across tissues. Closer inspection showed some to be immune-related genes, e.g. TLR and MHC genes, and their presence in the databases is likely an artefact of the approaches used to define them

65

. As a direct validation of their specificity of expression, single-cell transcriptomics data derived from the mouse brain and lung showed the signature genes to be highly and specifically expressed in ependymal and ciliated epithelial cells, respectively, of these tissues. Hence, the signature as a whole could help in identifying motile cilia biology in bulk and single cell transcriptomics data due to its conserved nature across several cells and tissues. Furthermore, in representing a homeostatic motile cilia, the signature would be a reference to motile cilia in disease models.

The HPA resource was used to further verify the validity of signature genes based on IHC analysis. Genes for which there was data were ranked as being of either high or medium confidence based on their expression pattern matching that expected for proteins associated with motile cilia. Our analysis of the HPA data showed it to validate the majority of signature genes; 48% were scored as high confidence genes and 20% as medium confidence, based on the criteria outlined in the methods. Nothing could be concluded for the 32% genes for which no data was available or the data was of very poor quality. Remarkably, none of the protein localization data directly contradicted an association of any gene with motile cilia. We then set out to further investigate six genes,

EFCAB6

having no HPA data and five high confidence genes based on their HPA IHC results but with poor evidence of their association with cilia in humans based on literature:

ARMC3

,

FAM183A

,

MYCBPAP, RIBC2

and

VWA3A

. ISH experiments performed on the chicken choroid plexus, showed

FAM183A, EFCAB6 and MYCBPAP

to be expressed by motile ciliated cells lining this tissue, although this was not apparent for

RIBC2

,

VWA3A

and

ARMC3

. Apart from being a possible false negative, this discrepancy could be indicative of the diversity of ciliary components in eukaryotes

66

. A recent study using evolutionary proteomics has predicted

MYCBPAP

to be associated with cilia, and ISH of the

FAM183A

orthologue has shown to positively stain motile ciliated tissue in

Xenopus laevis

67

,

68

. In support of our observations, ISH data from the Allen brain atlas for the selected genes showed positive staining of ciliated cells lining the ventricles of the mouse brain. Finally, we have summarized our findings graphically based on database and literature mining of the known associations of signature genes with cilia structures and function, as well as human ciliopathies. Clearly, many of the known components of the motile cilia machinery have been identified by this study, and many others have evidence supporting their association but not with specific components of the organelle. The curation of the list clearly highlights the many potentially novel cilia genes/proteins identified by this work and those which can be further examined.

In summary, we have used coexpression analyses to identify a set of 248 genes highly associated with the presence of motile ciliated cells within human tissue. Significant efforts were then made to validate the genes identified based on further coexpression analyses, extensive searches of the literature, online resources of information on the cellular and tissue expression data for genes and proteins, as well as public databases of cilia related genes across different species. Along with a graphical description of signature genes within cilia, the signature highlights similar genes from cilia and centrosome databases, helping in the categorization of known cilia genes. In the case of a number of poorly described genes we identified i.e.

ARMC3

,

EFCAB6, FAM183A, MYCBPAP

,

RIBC2

and

VWA3A,

we have been able to provide new evidence supporting their association with motile cilia. Such analyses serve to extend and refine the list of genes/proteins specifically associated with motile cilia, allowing more targeted analyses of their localisation and functional role within these complex and important organelles.

Material and methods

Data pre-processing, signature derivation

Pre-normalized RNA-Seq data from the GTEx project

38

was downloaded (version 7) and log-transformed. Data for tissues known to possess motile ciliated cells were sub-sampled. These included samples taken from seven regions of the brain (n = 863), lung (n = 427), testis (n = 259), fallopian tube (n = 7) and endocervix (n = 5). Due to the small number of samples of fallopian tube and endocervix, data from these tissues were combined. As such, the relative content of motile cilia containing cells varied considerably across samples, with the expression of genes specifically associated with these structures varying accordingly. Motile cilia-associated genes were identified for each individual tissue by GCN analysis. In order to generate a GCN, a gene-to-gene Pearson correlation matrix was calculated between all genes using the network analysis software, Graphia v1 (Kajeka Ltd., Edinburgh, UK,

https://kajeka.com/graphia/

). A threshold of

r

≥ 0.8 was then applied such that only genes correlated to others above this threshold were connected by an edge. In each case, a structured GCN was generated with modules of coexpressed genes forming highly connected cliques within the network. These were defined as clusters using the Markov clustering algorithm (MCL)

69

, using an inflation value MCLi = 2.2 (which defines the granularity of clustering). Putative motile cilia-associated genes were defined as those present in the same cluster as

FOXJ1

. Accordingly, four gene clusters were obtained, one for each tissue type. This approach has been adopted previously to identify co-regulated genes with a related function or association with a given cell type

48

–

50

. From the four tissue-derived signatures, those genes common to all four signatures were considered for the final human motile cilia signature. Evidence for an association with cilia was explored through literature mining and enrichment analysis, conducted using ToppGene

70

. Disease association for genes was found through the OMIM database

40

.

Functional annotation of motile cilia signature genes and comparison with databases

Evidence for an association of the 248 motile cilia signature genes with cilia was explored through literature mining and enrichment analysis, conducted using ToppGene

70

. Signature genes were then compared to genes listed in the databases of cilia and centrosomal components, i.e. CentrosomeDB

33

, CilDB

34

, CiliaCarta

36

and SysCilia (gold standard)

35

were collated based on their Ensembl gene IDs and compared to the signature list derived here (Table

S3

). The expression profile of this combined list was examined across 51 tissues (excluding samples derived from pooled cells) of the GTEx dataset (n = 11,215, donors = 713). A GCN was then generated using these genes only, again using a correlation threshold of

r

≥ 0.8 and the resultant graph was clustered using a low inflation value (MCLi = 1.2) so as to provide a coarse grain segmentation of the graph comprising of 17 clusters.

To explore the expression of the signature genes at a cellular level, single cell transcriptomics data from the mouse brain and lung were taken from the Mouse Cell Atlas

71

and analysed. These tissues were selected as they include populations of motile ciliated cells. The batch corrected expression matrices based on unique molecular identifiers were downloaded from the mouse cell atlas database (

https://figshare.com/articles/MCA_DGE_Data/5435866

). This included batch 1 of the brain (n = 3285 cells) and lung (n = 2501 cells) cell data. Additionally, for the latter, 11 cells annotated as “dividing cells” were excluded, as it was unclear which cell types these referred to. Corresponding mouse orthologues for signature genes were identified based on their Ensembl gene ID using BioMart

72

. The average expression of signature genes was then tested for significance in the ciliated cell populations (ependymal cells of the brain and ciliated epithelial cells of the lung), versus all other cell types as defined in the mouse cell atlas. The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was adopted for these comparisons.

Immunohistochemistry and RNA

in situ

hybridisation

The tissue distribution of mRNA and proteins for all signature genes were investigated using publicly available resources. IHC staining of human tissue sections from the bronchus and fallopian tube were examined in the HPA

43

. In both tissues, positive staining of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the tissue was considered as validatory evidence.

The expression of a number of novel genes were further examined in the choroid plexus of chicken embryos (stage 35, day 9) by ISH. Chicken embryos were obtained from wild type Isa Brown fertile chicken eggs and were incubated for 9 days and sacrificed as per approval by The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh under supervision and approval of a Named Animal Care Welfare Officer in accordance with the regulations prescribed for animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, UK. Although not subject to this act, fertilised eggs were monitored throughout incubation to ensure high welfare standards. Researchers involved in this project have the necessary UK Home Office Project and Personal licenses for undertaking experimental protocols involving the use of animals in this project. For selected genes, clones which covered the majority of exons near the centre of the gene were preferentially selected (

and where available obtained (Source BioSciences, UK)

74

. Fertilised chicken eggs were incubated for nine days at which point the embryos were sacrificed, the choroid plexus dissected and tissues fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C. Samples were then rinsed in PBS and equilibrated overnight in 15% sucrose/PBS before embedding in sucrose-gelatin (15%:7.5%) and snap frozen in isopentane at −70 °C. Cryostat sections (10 µm) were cut and stored overnight at −20 °C. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and fixed overnight in 4% PFA. After successive rinses with PBS, the tissue was permeabilized by incubation in proteinase-K (20 ng/ml K-03115836001 Roche) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were treated consecutively with 4% PFA, acetic anhydride solution (0.25% acetic anhydride and 1.3% triethanolamine) with intermittent washing. Finally, 5 nM probe in hybridisation buffer (50% formamide, 5xSSC pH 4.5, 0.05 µg/ml yeast RNA, 0.05 µg/ml heparin, and 1% SDS) was applied to the slides. Following an overnight hybridization with probes at 65 °C, sections went through a series of post-hybridization washes and then maleic acid buffer-tween (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.18 M NaOH and 0.02% tween). After blocking (20% heat-inactivated FBS/KTBT) for 1 h, sections were incubated overnight with 1:1000 anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphate (11093274910 Roche, 1:1000) at 4 °C. Following a final series of washing with maleic acid buffer-tween, sections were incubated with staining solution (3.5 µl/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, N-6876 Sigma; 3.5 µl/ml BCIP, B-8503). After staining for 1–2 h (depending on the probe), the reaction was stopped by several rinses in PBS. ISH staining of brain sections for these genes was also examined in data from the mouse Allen brain atlas

75

, where the choroid plexus and ventricular system were present (which is lined with motile ciliated ependymal cells).

#### EFCAB6 - Article 3: Founder Mutations for Early Onset Melanoma as Revealed by Whole Exome Sequencing Suggests That This is Not Associated with the Increasing Incidence of Melanoma in Poland
<Date>: 2018-5-14
<PMCID>: 6333986
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Melanoma is one of the most aggressive human malignancies. The mean survival time for metastatic patients is 6 months when standard chemotherapy is used or up to 12 months if used in combination with the BRAF enzyme inhibitor vemurafenib. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing dramatically in the Caucasian population since the 1950s [

1

].

In Poland the number of affected individuals has increased by 60% over the past 11 years and has reached over 2,600 new cases identified annually. The etiology of melanoma is complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Significant heritability of this malignancy was observed in large twin study [

2

].

Family studies provide strong support for heterogeneous mechanisms involved in a polygenic inherited susceptibility to melanoma that includes both inherited high-risk and lowrisk alleles. To date only one major melanoma susceptibility gene:

CDKN2A

has been identified, responsible for only up to 20% of melanoma-prone patients [

3

]. Mutations within other malignant melanoma (MM) high-risk genes, such as

CDK4, ACD, CXC, TERT, TERF2IP, BAP1

, or

POT1

are extremely rare and to date have been identified only in few families worldwide. Because germline mutations in

CDKN2A

are present in a minority of melanoma patients it is expected that additional genes will be discovered with next generation sequence technology that focuses on whole-exome or wholegenome sequencing. Onset of MM at an early age is suggestive of a hereditary predisposition. However, the heritability of early-onset MM remains unexplained even in a larger proportion of apparent sporadic cases than among familial cases. Thus far in the literature there appears to be a paucity of data from whole exome sequencing among early-onset MM cases.

Given the unique homogenous structure of the Polish population, we undertook an exome screen to determine if there existed one or more novel high/moderate risk gene(s) for MM, which may be associated with specific founder effects. Herein, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on a cohort of 96 unrelated Polish patients with melanoma diagnosed under the age of 40 years. All of whom had previously been screened for the present of causative

CDKN2A

-variants and found not to harbor any. We studied both recessive and dominant inheritance patterns by analyses of both sporadic and familial early onset MM cases. We evaluated protein truncating DNA alterations only and selected genes for further study based on the relevance of the gene to carcinogenesis.

In the subsequent verification step, we evaluated recurrent truncating mutations identified by WES in large case-control study of 1,200 unselected MM patients and 6,200 control subjects from Poland.

Materials and Methods

1. Study subjects

1) Discovery phase

In the first step of this study, we have performed whole exome sequencing in a cohort of 96 unrelated patients with early-onset (< 40 years) melanoma who all screened negative for CDKN2A-causative variants (65 females; mean age, 30.8 years; range, 15 to 40 years and 31 males; mean age, 30.9 years; range, 18 to 39 years). Half of the patients (48 cases) were also characterized by a familial aggregation of melanoma among first- or second-degree relatives.

2) Validation phase

We verified the role of variants revealed by WES using a large case control-study of 1,230 unselected melanoma patients (760 females; mean age, 53.9 years; range, 15 to 92 years and 470 males; mean age, 55 years; range, 18 to 84 years) from Poland. 748 unselected MM cases (464 women; mean age, 53.7 years; 284 men) comprising 62.3% of the total group were diagnosed between 2002 and 2006 and identified from cancer registries in five Polish cities (Szczecin, Opole, Bialystok, Zielona Gora, and Gorzow Wielkopolski). The registries capture more than 95% of all diagnosed melanomas. The remaining 482 (37.7%) unselected MM cases (296 females, 186 males) were diagnosed in the city of Szczecin between the years 2010 and 2016.

The control group consisted two non-overlapping cohorts of healthy adults. All mutations that were confirmed by Sanger sequencing were genotyped in a group of 1,696 healthy adults (943 women, 753 men) with no cancers diagnosed in their families. The healthy adults were assessed as having a negative cancer family history (first- and seconddegree relatives included) after answering questionnaires about their family's medical history, which was part of a population-based study of the 1.5 million residents of West Pomerania aimed at identifying familial aggregations of malignancies performed recently by our center. During the interview, the goals of the study were explained, informed consent was obtained, genetic counseling was given and a blood sample was taken for DNA analysis. Individuals affected with any malignancy or with cancers diagnosed among first- or second-degree relatives were excluded from our study control group.

Variants with significantly different allele distribution among cases and the first cohort of controls, described above, were additionally genotyped in a second cohort of 5,000 healthy adults (1,775 men; mean age, 58 years and 3,225 females; mean age, 60 years) who underwent genetic counselling and were diagnosed as having no genetically increased risk of cancer on the basis of molecular examination and a negative cancer family history. During the interview, the goals of the study were explained, informed consent was obtained, genetic counseling was given and a blood sample was taken for DNA analysis. Individuals affected with any malignancy or with cancers diagnosed among firstor second-degree relatives were excluded from our study control group.

Overall, patient participation rates exceeded 75%. All patients and control subjects were of European ancestry and ethnic Poles.

2. Whole exome sequencing

DNA has been isolated using standard methods from peripheral blood leukocytes taken from participants in Department of Genetics and Pathology in Szczecin.

The Illumina Nexter Rapid Capture Expanded Exome kit (target region size=62 MB, coding exons, untranslated regions (UTRs) and miRNAs included; Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for capturing sequence target regions. The kit captured 62 Mbp of the human genome covering coding exons in CCDS and RefSeq databases as well as exons annotated by GENCODE project. The captured regions for each sample were barcoded and every two samples were pooled and used for paired-end sequencing for 100 cycles (generating 100 bp reads) on a single lane of Illumina HiSeq2000’s flow-cell. The 100 million reads for each exome sequence for each individual were aligned to the reference sequence of the human genome using Burrows-Wheeler transform algorithm [

4

]. SAMtools [

5

] and GATK [

6

] packages as well as SCALPEL algorithm [

7

] were used for calling variants.

We considered only those genes with a minimum of two patients as candidates for further studies.

We employed disease-network approach to select those genes which are functionally more related to cancer pathogenesis (such as DNA repair and cell cycle control pathway genes) using the ToppGene algorithm [

8

].

3. Sanger sequencing

Each variant identified by WES in the discovery phase and selected for validation was confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing. Sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing products were analyzed on the ABI Prism 3500XL Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). All sequences were compared reference sequences for variant detection using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics).

4. TaqMan genotyping

DNA was isolated from 5 to 10 mL of peripheral blood. The validated variants were genotyped using a TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies) and the Light-Cycler Real-Time PCR 480 system (Roche Life Science, Indianapolis, IN). The primer and probe sequences are available upon request. Laboratory technicians were blinded to casecontrol status. The overall genotyping call rate was 99.3%. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing as described above.

5. Data analysis

All genotype comparisons between cases and controls were performed using Fisher exact test, and two-tailed p-values were calculated. OR values were calculated for each comparison together with their 95% confidence intervals. To exclude recessive trait of inheritance we performed additional genotyping of parents and siblings of patients with identified mutations from the cohort of 96 early-onset MM cases.

6. Ethical statement

The Polish study was approved by the ethics committee of Pomeranian Medical University (Szczecin, Poland). All study subjects provided a signed consent form for participation in the study.

Results

Using GATK algorithm, we detected 2,272,282 indels in the total data set for our cohort of early-onset melanoma patients, after prioritization we identified 1,012 new and 218 previously reported frameshift mutations (523 new variants in sporadic early-onset cases and 489 in familial cases; 137 previously reported variants in sporadic cases and 81 in familial cases). Using SCALPEL algorithm, we detected 2,297 variants (1,151 of them in sporadic early-onset cases, 1,146 in familial cases). These comprised 3′ UTR and 5′ UTR variants (452 and 56, respectively), 228 downstream variants, 88 in frame deletions, 40 intergenic variants, 1,000 intron variants, 11 intron variants and NMD transcript variants, 55 intron variants and non-coding transcript variants, 57 non-coding transcript exon variants and noncoding transcript variants, five regulatory regions variants, three splice acceptor variants, 60 splice region variants and intron variants, two transcription factor variants, one splice region variant and intron variant and noncoding transcript variant, 161 upstream gene variants and 74 frameshift mutations.

The frameshift mutations were selected for further interrogation as they were most likely to reveal new genes of interest with respect to melanoma development.

All the frameshift mutations were filtered by examining the quality control values, minor allele frequencies and intense gene databases/literature data analysis supported by the ToppGene algorithm. We selected 21 potentially deleterious variants in 20 genes, which after confirmation by Sanger sequencing were evaluated in the association study. These included the genes

VRK1

(a serine/threonine kinase actively expressed in dividing cells),

MYCT1

(proposed to regulate certain MYC target genes),

DNAH14

(involved in microtubule motilities),

CASC3

(functions in nonsense mediated mRNA decay),

MS4A12

(associated with inhibition of cellular proliferation of colon cancer cells),

PRC1

(a key regulator of cytokinesis),

WWOX

(acts as a tumour supressor, expression is associated with apoptosis),

CARD6

(encodes a caspase recruitment domain that may be involved in apoptosis),

EFCAB6

(encodes a protein which directly binds the oncogene DJ-1 and androgen receptor),

EXO5

(involved in DNA repair following Uv-light irradiation),

CASC3

(known as cancer susceptibility 3 and involved in nonsensemediated mRNA decay),

STK33

(a serine threonine kinase involved in MAP kinase signaling),

SAMD11

(transcription coactivator activity and PH domain binding required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes),

CPNE1

(involved in calcium mediated intra-cellular processes),

CABLES1

(a cyclin dependent kinase binding protein that is involved in p53/p73 induced cell death),

LEKR1

(structural constituent of ribosome),

NUDT17

(most likely mediates the hydrolysis of some nucleoside disphosphate derivatives),

CASP8AP2

(plays a regulatory role in Fasmediated apoptosis),

RRP 15

(a ribosomal protein subunit), and

CREB3L3

(member of the basic-leucine zipper family and the AMP-dependent transcription factor family, linked to acute inflammatory response and hepatocellular carcinoma). Mutations in

VRK1, MYCT1, DNAH14, MS4A12, PRC1, CARD6, STK33, EFCAB6, EXO5

, and

SAMD11

genes were found among early onset cases;

CREB3L3, CNDP2, CABLES1, RRP 15

, and

CASP8AP2

genes in familial cases;

CASC3, WWOX, CPNE1, LEKR1

, and

NUDT17

in both subgroups.

The variants in these genes were further investigated in those families where trios were available to determine if they were recessively or dominantly inherited. The results of this aspect of the study revealed that there were some genetic variants that were homozygous in the proband and in one or other of the parents. Further evaluation revealed that these variants were unlikely to be associated with disease since either the unaffected parents were both homozygous for the allele and the proband heterozygous or the proband was homozygous for the variant and one of the parents were homozygous and the other heterozygous for that specific allele. Genotyping of the parents of homozygous carriers of identified mutations revealed no case of homozygous proband and both parents being the carriers of the mutations. Together, this suggested that those variants were unlikely to be associated with any change in melanoma risk (

Table 1

).

Additional evidence about the pathogenicity of the identified variants was provided by a replication study where a set of 1,200 melanoma patient DNA samples was compared to a similarly large series of control DNA samples taken from healthy subjects (

Table 2

).

The results revealed that most of the changes were neutral but although we found no statistically significant differences between cases and controls, 10 genes cannot be excluded as being associated with melanoma risk—due to genetic heterogeneity and the reduced penetrance of this disease. A greater level of confidence in the pathogenicity of the variant was observed if the homozygous state was associated with a greater difference in risk compared to being in the heterozygote state. Unfortunately, many of the variants occurred within the study populations at much lower frequency to be reliably associated with disease risk. Potential candidates included

WWOX, VRK1, CREB3L3, EFCAB6, CARD6, EXO5, MS4A12, CASC3

, and

STK3

. From this list of genes, the most promising were

VRK1, CREB3L3, EXO5

, and

STK33

as there was a tendency of decreasing risk of melanoma for heterozygote and homozygote carriers of

VRK1

and

EXO5

and an increasing risk of disease for

CREB3L3

and

STK33

.

Discussion

From 2008 to 2013, the approach of finding melanoma susceptibility genes centered on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The results of several of these studies aimed at identifying susceptibility loci for melanoma have been reported [

9

-

12

]. The results of these studies have reported new susceptibility loci for melanoma, but the effect sizes reported from these GWAS have been modest with odds ratios at best being ~1.5. None of the GWAS has thus far led to the adoption of a clinical test for a newly discovered genetic locus.

Low-penetrance variants cannot be categorically associated with familial clusters, for many reasons that include molecular interactions between low/moderate penetrance genes, which could potentially be responsible for early-onset disease.

Recently, WES has been developed which overcomes many of the problems of GWAS [

6

]. It is estimated that the protein coding regions of the human genome (exons) constitute about 85% of disease-causing mutations [

13

]. Wholeexome and whole-genome studies have identified numerous genes somatically altered in melanoma tumors and highlighted a higher mutation load in melanoma compared with those in other cancers, such as,

TP53, NF1

, and

ARID2

[

14

,

15

]. However, to date only a few new genes/cancer susceptibility alleles in melanoma-prone families have been identified using whole exome or whole genome sequencing. Germline mutations of all of the genes identified to date are found in a very small proportion of families that can not account for the growing frequency of the disease. The list includes the

TERT

promoter mutation found among German familial melanoma patients [

16

], a

POLE1

missense mutation detected in one family [

17

],

ACD

with mutations in six families and four families carrying

TERF2IP

variants, which included nonsense mutations in both genes) and point mutations that co-segregated with melanoma [

18

]; finally a

RAD51B

nonsense mutation was identified in one family [

19

]. WES also identified a

BAP1

splice mutation occurring in a family with uveal MM [

20

]. Direct Sanger sequencing of this gene revealed germline mutation among early-onset uveal patients [

21

].

Given the homogeneity of the Polish population we expected to find a limited number of recurrent founder mutations. However, we found large numbers of germline DNA alterations which appeared causative as they were predicted to result in truncated protein products, but none appeared to be novel high-risk melanoma gene in either sporadic familial early-onset patients. We observed known recurrent truncating mutations in genes predisposing to other cancers, such as

NOD2

(3020insC),

CHEK2

(1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395), and

NBS1

(657del5). Their distribution among melanoma patients was not significantly different to that observed amongst healthy controls (data available upon request). Although evaluation of somatic mutations was not the subject of the study, it would be very interesting to compare the results from melanoma skin and blood samples. Increased frequency of somatic mutations could point at melanoma-susceptibility candidate genes.

Taken together the results from this study with respect to the Polish population suggests that there is extensive genetic heterogeneity within melanoma families from Poland that can not be explained by a few recurrent highly penetrant causal variants. Large multi-center studies are needed for further investigation of possible involvement of

VRK1, CREB3L3, EXO5

, and

STK33

genes in melanoma development. Additionally to reveal the genetic association with new mutation with relation with early-onset melanoma long, prospective follow-up study of the families with identified DNA variants is needed.

Introduction

Sensory ganglia have distinct and specialized physiological and pathophysiological functions

1

. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are located in intervertebral foramina at different spinal levels and mainly innervate tissues within the trunk, hands, legs and feet

1

. Trigeminal ganglia (TG) lie within the Meckel's cave and innervate the head and neck area

1

. Sensory neurons of nodose and jugular ganglion complex (NG/JG) are located in the jugular foramen and innervate certain internal organs

1

. Neurons of these ganglia relay sensory information from the external environment as well as internal organs and tissues to the central nervous system

2

–

4

. Sensory nerves originating from the cell bodies of these ganglia are classified into nociceptive fibers (unmyelinated C fibers and myelinated Aδ) and low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs; myelinated Aα and Aβ fibers).

Besides their distinct location and innervation pattern, DRG, TG, and NG/JG ganglion sensory neurons each have specialized function with their own respective biochemical and electrical properties. Evidence for these differences has been expanded in recent years with the advent of techniques such as RNA-seq, single-cell sequencing as well as the generation of a set of cell-specific reporter mouse lines

5

–

7

. These new technologies have confirmed that the proportion of unmyelinated/myelinated trigeminal nerves is substantially lower compared to DRG nerves

8

, while Aα proprioceptors are located in the DRG but absent in TG

9

,

10

. Single-cell transcriptional profiles of DRG sensory neurons located in T10-L1, which innervate the intestine/colon and feet/legs, are substantially different compared to L3–L5 DRG neurons

11

,

12

. Moreover, T10-L1 DRG neurons have a unique subset of sensory neuronal groups compared to L3–L5 DRG neurons

11

,

12

. The DRG neuronal transcriptional profile in turn greatly differs from TG neuronal profiles

13

,

14

. Additionally, DRG and TG neurons differ in their translational potential for mTOR-related genes and AMP-activated protein kinase

15

. With regards to NG sensory neurons, they possess much different expression profiles compared to sensory neurons from JG and DRG

16

.

RNA-seq of L3–L5 DRG and TG neurons taken from mice expressing the sensory neuron specific advillin-GFP reporter revealed that vasopressin receptor 1A (

Avpr1a

), oxytocin receptor (

Oxtr

), and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit delta (

Gabrd

) are selectively expressed in TG with little to no expression in DRG sensory neurons

14

. In contrast, DRG sensory neurons have been shown to specifically express a set of

Hox

genes and the receptor for the hormone prolactin (

Prlr

)

14

. Here, we expand upon this experimental approach by including comparison between neurons of DRG from different levels (T10-L1), lumbar DRG, NG/JG and TG. We have used the Pirt/TdTomato mouse reporter line along with enhanced sorting using both a larger nozzle and double sorting methods

13

that increases purification of sensory neuronal fraction to > 90% while maintaining the natural proportion of large-diameter sensory neurons. Our work, has revealed several additional genes, including prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) with expression restricted to adult male mouse in TG but no other sensory ganglia. Accordingly, we investigated specificity of PRL, GH and POMC expression as well as the functional implication of GH in nociception in the head and neck area.

Results

To isolate sensory neurons, we used Pirt/TdTomato reporter mice

17

and captured small-to-large-sized (10–80 μm) sensory neurons using a 100 μm nozzle. We first gated singlets from doublets (Fig.

1

A). Live cells separated from all singlets were used to gate Pirt/TdTomato

+

cells (Fig.

1

A). Medium-to-strongly expressing Pirt/TdTomato

+

neurons, were gated against TdTomato

-

wild-type neurons (Fig.

1

B). Omitting low expressing Pirt/TdTomato

+

neurons from gating is a critical step since it increases enrichment levels for Pirt

+

neurons. Additionally, two cycles of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) insured maximal purity (> 90%) of sensory neuronal fractions in samples

13

(Fig.

1

C). To validate size distributions of sorted Pirt + neurons, two-cycle FACS-sorted cells were plated on coverslip and their size was assessed using NIS-elements (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) (Fig.

1

D). TG Pirt

+

cell size distribution shows that described two-cycle sorting procedure captures small as well as large sensory neurons (Fig.

1

E). Proportions of Pirt/TdTomato

+

cells to live cells were found to vary from ganglion-to-ganglion and between samples (Fig.

1

F). TG samples had the greatest cell number with NG/JG samples having the least. However, we used approximately similar numbers of cells for RNA-seq experiments (Fig.

1

G).

Differentially expressing genes (DEG)s for L3–L5 DRG versus T10-L1 DRG sensory neurons

Single-cell sequencing showed substantial differences in the subset of sensory neuronal groups innervating leg and paws (L3–L5 DRG) compared to colon and intestine (T10-L1 DRG) in male mice

11

,

12

. Accordingly, we compared transcriptomics of sorted sensory neurons from these ganglia. Using strengthened selection criteria outlined in the Materials and Methods section, no DEGs were revealed. However, lowering strength of the selection criteria using fold change (FC) > 5 and

P

value < 0.05 showed that compared to T10-L1 DRG versus L3–L5 DRG had 59 DEGs at RPKM > 5 and 28 DEGs at RPKM > 10. DEG numbers of T10-L1 relative to L3–L5 DRG with the same selection criteria were 58 at RPKM > 5 and 36 at RPKM > 10. Notable DEGs are highlighted in Table

1

. Thus, nervous system related genes such as

Ntsr2, Th, Trpv1, Accn1, Kcnh6, Cacna1b,

and

Gabrb3

were enriched in L3–L5 DRG, while immune system related genes

Il6, Ccr1, Cxcl10, Nfkbie, Icam1,

and

Cd248

are mainly expressed in T10-L1 (Table

1

). Consequently, gene clustering according to statistical overrepresentation test for biological processes using the PANTHER software assigned 9 predominant DEGs from L3–L5 DRG to the regulation of membrane potential. Biological processes assigned for T10-L1 DRG DEGs were involved in the regulation of MAPK cascade (10 DEGs) and cellular response to organic substance (15 DEGs). Importantly, many of these DEGs, including

Ccr1, Cxcl10, Pdgfc, Nfil3, Irgm1, Il6,

and

Icam1

are linked to immune processes.

DEGs for NG/JG versus L3–L5 DRG and T10-L1 DRG

Nodose-jugular ganglion complex has a specialized role in regulation of several vital visceral organs such as heart, lung, trachea, esophagus, and intestine

16

. Comparison of NG/JG sensory neuronal transcriptomic profiles to DRG revealed only several NG/JG-selective DEGs using outlined selection criteria (see “Materials and Methods”) (Table

2

). DRG sensory neurons contain much more predominant DEGs compared to NG/JG. Thus, T10-L1 DRG sensory neurons have 113 DEGs at RPKM > 5 compared to NG/JG; L3–L5 DRG sensory neurons contain 99 such DEGs with 50 overlapping (Fig.

2

A). These DRG-selective DEGs relative to NG/JG sensory neurons cannot be broken onto biological processes using statistical overrepresentation test. Nevertheless, DRG has several notable selective DEGs compared to NG/JG complex sensory neurons, including

Mrgprd

and

Hoxa7

(Table

3

).

DEGs with strong specificity for DRG, NG/JG and TG sensory neurons

Using pair comparison and Venn diagram analysis we found

Phox2b

(paired-like homeobox 2b) and

Efcab6

(EF-hand calcium binding domain 6) as DEGs that were strongly specific to male mouse NG/JG sensory neurons with little-to-no expression in DRG and TG (Fig.

2

B; Table

2

).

Phox2b

is a transcription factor specifically expressed in neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system

18

.

Phox2b

controls the development of peripheral chemoreceptors and afferent visceral pathways

19

.

Phox2b

is critical for the switch during embryo development from somatic to visceral cranial sensory pathways

20

. The function of

Efcab6

in sensory neurons is not clear. Several mRNA sensory neuronal markers found in the DRG and TG neurons are absent in NG/JG. For example, NG/JG sensory neurons do not express

Mrgprd

(Table

3

), an established marker of IB4

+

DRG neurons

11

,

21

. A marker of proprioceptors,

Pvalb

, is also absent in NG/JG neurons, but is highly expressed in TG neurons, despite the fact that TG do not have proprioreceptors

1

,

11

,

22

. Another example is calcitonin-related polypeptide beta,

Calcb

, which is at > 40-fold lesser in NG/JG sensory neurons compared to DRG or TG. Other notable DEGs lacking expression in NG/JG neurons are

Pdgfrl

,

Orai1

and

Xylt2

(Table

3

).

Hox genes play critical roles in development of many cell types, especially a subset of neurons, during embryogenesis

23

. We found

Hoxa7, Hoxa9,

are also specific for T10-L1 DRG sensory neurons compared to TG neurons. Interestingly most Hox genes, except for

Hoxa7

was the only DEG distinctively expressed in both T10-L1 and L3–L5 DRG, but not NG/JG or TG. We did not find Hox genes that lack transcription in DRG neurons.

Venn analysis of DEGs showed that 6 genes had significantly higher presence in TG compared to L3–L5 DRG, T10-L1 DRG as well as NG/JG sensory neurons (Fig.

Expression of Prl, Gh and Pomc gene products in sensory ganglia.

Sorting pure sensory neuronal fraction is challenging, as sensory neurons constitute only 5–10% of ganglion cells

22

,

41

, and non-neuronal cells are difficult to dissociate from neurons

41

. Furthermore, RNA-seq data need validation with immunohistochemistry (IHC), as RT-PCR alone again requires FACS sorting of sensory neurons. Accordingly, we used IHC to examine sensory ganglia from male mice expressing PRL, GH and POMC proteins. Here we employed POMC antibodies against 138–150 amino acid residue peptides, which corresponds to the position of a-MSH and ACTH hormone. POMC showed a moderate-to-high level of expression in 63.3 ± 14.2% (n = 3) TG neurons, low level in DRG neurons and was absent in NG/JG neurons (Fig.

4

, the upper panel

). GH (Fig.

4

, the middle panel

) and PRL (Fig.

4

, the bottom panel

) were almost exclusively in a subset of male mouse TG neurons. GH was expressed at medium-to-strong levels (i.e. clear above background) in 17.5 ± 5.4% (n = 3), and PRL in 14.3 ± 6.1% (n = 3) of male mouse TG neurons. These results correspond with previous single-cell sequencing studies of male mouse DRG neurons showing low levels (1 to 9 RPKM) of POMC mRNA, and no expression of GH or PRL mRNA

11

. We also evaluated a GH

cell size distribution and expression in TRPV1

+

and CGRP

+

nociceptive sensory neurons. GH was detected in all sizes of sensory neurons with minimal in < 15 μm neurons (3.3 ± 1.1%; n = 3) and maximal presence in 15–25 μm neurons (40.6 ± 3.3%; n = 3; Fig.

C). To detect TRPV1

and CGRP

+

TG neurons, TRPV1-GFP and CGRP/TdTomato reporter mice were used

22

(Fig.

TG neurons, 26.0 ± 4.9% (n = 3) had TRPV1 (yellow arrows; Fig.

5

A,A’,D) and 54.4 ± 4.6% (n = 3) expressed CGRP (yellow arrows; Fig.

5

B,B’,D). According to these results, approximately 74% of sensory neurons were GH

/trpV1

-

and 45% GH

+

TG neurons did not express CGRP. Overall, these data indicate that GH is expressed in both nociceptive and non-nociceptive TG sensory neurons.

To further investigate GH and POMC expression, we performed whole mount IHC on male mouse dura biopsies as it was previously done for PRL

. Hence, Fig.

cannot definitively tell whether GH and POMC are expressed in C- and/or A-fiber containing TG neurons. Altogether, these data suggest a surprising expression of classical pituitary hormones POMC, GH, and PRL in TG, but not DRG or NG/JG sensory neurons.

Exogenous GH-induced hypersensitivity in the spinal system

Sex-dependent actions of exogenous and endogenous PRL in the spinal and trigeminal system are reported

31

,

34

,

38

. Growth hormone receptor

43

is expressed on DRG or TG neurons

11

(see also RNA-seq Supplementary data). IHC data (Figs.

4

,

5

,

6

) indicate that along with their endocrine effects, endogenous GH could exert autocrine or paracrine actions upon release from non-neuronal extra-pituitary cells at periphery (i.e. hindpaws, dura, masseter muscle, etc.), spinal cord, brain stem or TG neurons. Here, we evaluated whether exogenously delivered GH can produce hypersensitivity in the spinal and trigeminal systems.

Intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of 5 μg mouse GH did not generate heat (2-way ANOVA; F (2, 30) = 0.2332;

P

= 0.7934; n = 6; Fig.

7

A) or mechanical hypersensitivity (F (3, 32) = 0.2845;

P

= 0.8362; n = 5; Fig.

7

B). Intrathecal delivery of 5 μg mouse GH also did not produce thermal hypersensitivity F (5, 49) = 0.7880;

P

= 0.5634; n = 5; Fig.

7

C). Moreover, this intrathecal GH effect was slightly anti-hyperalgesic, although statistically insignificant (Fig.

7

C). In contrast, two independent trials showed that spinal GH (1 and 5 μg) generated significant mechanical hypersensitivity (F (12, 158) = 1.619;

P

= 0.0911; n = 8–12; Fig.

7

D). However, we did not observe dose-dependency of these effects (Fig.

7

D). These data suggest that in the spinal system, GH-induced nociceptive responses depend on whether peripheral or central DRG neuron terminals were activated via direct and/or indirect pathways.

Exogenous GH-induced hypersensitivity in the trigeminal system

Single administration of exogenous GH into the masseter muscle produced up to 4-days-lasting orofacial mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner (2-way ANOVA; F (4, 35) = 7.284;

P

= 0.0002; n = 4–5; Fig.

P

= 0.0004; n = 5–6; Fig.

, significantly reverse GH effects (F (4, 42) = 4.762;

P

= 0.0029; n = 4–8; Fig.

Discussion

The various sensory ganglia have distinct anatomical locations and unique functions as well as discrete pain pathological conditions associated with their sensory neurons

1

–

4

. Therefore, characterization of sensory neuron transcription and protein profiles in different ganglia are critically important for understanding underlying mechanisms of pain conditions associated with these sensory ganglia. There are multiple published studies delineating the differences in transcriptional and translational profiles between lumbar DRG and TG in rodents and humans

14

,

15

,

41

,

46

–

48

. In our and others estimation, sensory ganglia are composed of 90–95% non-neuronal cells (Fig.

1

C)

13

,

14

. Hence, to truly delineate transcriptomic profiles for sensory neurons, there is a need for vigorous and meticulous purification of sensory neuronal fractions from sensory ganglion preparations. Meticulous sensory neuronal purifications by FACS or sensory neuronal ribosome isolation have been performed in some

13

–

15

,

41

, but not all studies

46

–

48

. Sensory neuronal fraction purification by FACS requires the use of reporter mice

14

or back-labeling of sensory neurons with fluorescent tracers

13

. Reporter mice must possess high specificity in all (or almost all) sensory neurons. Specificity of the advillin promotor (Avil-GFP)

14

has been disputed

49

. Accordingly, we selected Pirt-cre/TdTomato reporter, specificity of which has been confirmed by two independent differential screening of subtractive libraries

21

,

50

and detailed anatomical studies

17

,

51

. Another challenge in purification of sensory neurons is created by their large size (15–70 μm). To avoid missing large neurons and damaging medium-to-large neurons, 100–130 μm nozzle is required during FACS

13

(Fig.

1

D,E). However, having a large nozzle, in turn, undermines FACS efficiency. Thus, a minimum of two cycles of sorting (used here) is required (Fig.

1

C). Moreover, to achieve high enrichment, weakly Pirt-expressing neurons should be omitted by gating (Fig.

1

B,C). Next, it appears that ganglion non-neuronal cells have tendency to create doublets with sensory neurons

41

. Separation of doublets from singlets during FACS is paramount for accurate purification of sensory neurons (Fig.

1

A). Finally, preparation from wild-type mouse sensory ganglia is necessary for correct setting of gates (Fig.

1

B). All these precautions are important for accurate and highly enriched sensory neuron-specific purifications.

We have detected differences in gene expression between sensory neurons of different ganglia by using RNA-sequencing on population of Pirt

+

neurons. Moreover, DEGs selection for further validation, and consideration for functional studies were quite strong: > 5 RPKM, fold-change (FC) > 5 and statistical significance for DEGs as Padj < 0.05. Populational based RNA-sequencing has strong and weak sites. Thus, this approach has strong signal to noise ratio, as well as reproducibility and reliability of results. Drawback of this approach is that for heterogeneous population as Pirt

+

neurons from different ganglia, it is impossible to tell whether a variation in transcript reads between distinct ganglia could be due to a differential proportion of gene-expressing neurons, or a differential level of transcript production in the gene-expressing neurons. Such questions could be answered by performing single-cell sequencing and analysis of sensory neurons from different ganglia. However, this approach has its own limitations such as difficulty in performing high quality single-cell sequencing on sensory neurons and especially single cell sequencing analysis for differences between two distinct groups of sensory neurons. In any case, transcriptomic data on differences between populations of sensory neurons generated by these approaches require further lengthy functional studies to prove meaningfulness of findings.

Besides traditional targets—L3–L5 DRG and TG, T10-L1 DRG and NG/JG were used as described experiments, as this allows for a broader picture on diversity for sensory neuronal transcriptomic profiles. Additionally, T10-L1 DRG and NG/JG are functionally distinct from L3–L5 DRG or TG neurons

1

–

4

. There is a set of DEGs, which were predominantly expressed in L3–L5, T10-L1 DRG, NG/JG or TG sensory neurons (

Tables 1

,

2

,

3

, Figs.

2

,

3

). These DEGs do not cover any particular biological processes according to the statistical overrepresentation test. Nevertheless, some DEGs are almost exclusively expressed in certain sensory ganglia. For example, we found

Phox2b

and

Efcab6

were specifically transcribed in NG/JG neurons compared to other ganglion sensory neurons (Table

2

). Function of

Efcab6

is not clear, while

Phox2b

regulates development of viscera controlling neurons of the peripheral and central nervous systems

18

–

20

. Moreover, NG/JG did not have sensory neurons expressing well-known markers—

Pvalb

and

Mrgprd

(Table

3

). Hox genes are selective for DRG sensory neurons.

Hoxa7

is specific for L3–L5 as well as T10-L1 DRG compare to NG/JG and TG neurons. Additionally,

Hoxa9

and

Hoxa10

express in L3–L5 DRG, but not NG/JG or TG neurons. Finally,

Hoxb2

,

Hoxb5

and

Hoxb7

were found to be specific for L3–L5 DRG neurons when compared to TG neurons. This is in line with others who have reported

Hox

genes exclusive for L3–L5 DRG neurons compared to TG neurons

14

.

Hox6a, Hoxb3, Hoxb6, Hoxc6, Hoxc8

,

Hoxc9, Hoxc10, Hoxd8, Hoxd9,

and

Hoxd10

were all exclusively expressed in L3–L5 DRG neurons, but P adjustment (Padj) was > 0.05 due to low RPKM values for these DEGs. Others have reported L3–L5 DRG sensory neuron-exclusive genes, such as

Kcnq5, Prlr,

and

AW551984

14

, at higher levels compared to TG neurons. Interestingly,

Prlr

expression is lacking in NG/JG sensory neurons. Our data showed that reported TG sensory neuron-selective genes, such as

Rgs6, Gabrd,

and

Oxtr

14

, have substantially (3–tenfold) higher RPKM in L3–L5 DRG, T10-L1 DRG, and even NG/JG neurons, while

Avpr1a

is evenly expressed in DRG and TG, but absent in NG/JG neurons. TG sensory-neuron-specific DEGs are presented in Fig.

3

B. Functional significance of

Krt18

and

Cyp2f2

gene products for TG neurons are not clear.

Ptgds

and

Prl

genes are involved in female-selective mechanisms of nociception for the spinal system

28

,

32

–

34

,

38

. Involvement of PTGDS or PRL proteins in sex-dependent regulation of nociception in the orofacial region have recently been reported

38

.

Here, we have focused our efforts to investigate whether GH contributes to regulation of nociception in the spinal versus trigeminal system. GH did not exert acute heat and mechanical hypersensitivity in male mouse hindpaw after local administration (Figs.

7

A,B). However, intra-spinal (i.e. intrathecal) injection of exogenous GH (1 or 5 μg) produced up to 4-day lasting mechanical, but not heat hypersensitivity (Figs.

7

C,D). Interestingly, no dose-dependency of GH action was recorded. This could indicate that lower GH dosage is able to produce hypersensitivity via acting on central terminals of sensory neurons. Another possibility is that GH activates spinal cord cells, which in turn release factors activating or sensitizing the central terminals in the spinal system. Unlike the spinal system, stimulation of peripheral terminal in the trigeminal system by GH produced profound acute hypersensitivity. Thus, orofacial mechanical hypersensitivity was induced by after single administration of GH into masseter muscle and periorbital mechanical hypersensitivity was detected after injection of GH into dura mater of male mice (Figs.

8

A,B). The effect of GH in the trigeminal system was dose-dependent (Fig.

8

A). This GH-induced hypersensitivity was meditated by GHR and reversed by pegvisomant (Fig.

8

C). These data indicate that ability of GH in induction of hypersensitivity in male mice depends on several factors such as modality (thermal vs. mechanical), sensory system (spinal vs. trigeminal), and application site (peripheral vs. central terminals).

Previous study shows that systemic application of GH (0.5 mg/kg) increased baseline mechanical nociception in P7, but not P14 male mice

39

. In contrast, heat baseline nociception was reduced in P7, but not P14 male mice

39

. These results agree with our data (Fig.

7

A,B). Interestingly, multiple systemic GH treatments attenuated carrageenan acute inflammatory hypersensitivity

39

. GH release hormone receptor (GHRHR) ablation induced behavioral and afferent hypersensitivity during early developmental stages but resolved at P21 age male mice

52

,

53

. Reported effects of GH in young male mice are attributed to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor

39

. It is not clear whether the action of GH is local, in the spinal cord or brain. However, systemically delivered GH is not readily cross the blood brain barrier

54

. Moreover, effect of GH in the spinal system has yet to be assessed in females, especially female mice at the reproduction age. Our data and previous literature suggest that GH could have differential effects on modulation of nociception and hypersensitivity in the trigeminal versus spinal systems. This is also supported by clinical data. Thus, acromegaly patients having excess GH often reported severe and prolonged headaches, but no pain in limbs (see review

55

).

An increased ACTH brings to Cushing and Addison disease. Patients with Cushing’s syndrome and Addison disease seldom report abdominal pain

56

,

57

. However, pain during these diseases was not associated with elevation of ACTH. Despite PRL, GH, and POMC-derived peptides/proteins are predominantly expressed in the pituitary at high levels, there is evidence for extra-pituitary presence of these hormones, especially in immune cells

58

–

61

. POMC-derived peptide could be involved in cell–cell communication via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Moreover, reduction of already low levels of POMC expression in DRG neurons of female and male mice with diabetic neuropathy contributes to hypersensitivity

40

. This effect was attributed to endorphins that could be processed from POMC

40

. Overexpression of POMC-derived endo-opioids in L3–L4 DRG does not change baseline nociception in female mice but suppresses diabetic neuropathy-induced hypersensitivity

40

. Interestingly, diabetic female mice develop heat hypersensitivity, as opposed to hyposensitivity in males, while POMC-MOR expression is downregulated in both female and male mice, and POMC effects in diabetic mice was not sex-dependent

40

. Like GH, POMC-derived peptides could have distinct signaling pathways and outcomes on modulation of nociception and hypersensitivity in the trigeminal versus spinal systems.

Overall, our approaches identify several DEGs that are specifically expressed in sensory neurons of DRG, NG/JG or TG. Interestingly, these genes include very prominent players in the endocrine system—PRL, GH, POMC as well as prolactin and oxytocin receptors. Moreover,

Prl, Prlr, Pomc

and

Ptgds

, which are involved in differential occurrences of pain disorders in men and women

28

,

31

,

34

,

40

,

62

, have differential expression for TG versus DRG and NG/JG neurons. Based on our findings, we favor the hypothesis that certain critical proteins for the endocrine system have different signaling pathways as well as pathophysiological outcomes for the spinal versus trigeminal system. Our results advance our understanding of unique properties of sensory ganglion neurons and provide a building step for further studies on regulation of nociceptive pathways by endogenous GH and POMC for pathological pain conditions affecting head and neck area (i.e. the trigeminal system).

Materials and methods

Mouse lines and reagents

All animal experiments conformed to APS’s Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals in Research and Training, and to protocols approved by the University Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We followed guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. The reporting in the manuscript follows the recommendations in the ARRIVE guidelines.

Eight-to-twelve-week-old naïve C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) male mice were used for all described experiments. In fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments, we used Pirt

Mouse GH was kindly provided by Novo Nordisk (Dr. Peter Thygesen). GH receptor (GHR) antagonist (Pegvisomant; PF-04748184), which blocks both mouse and human GHR, was kindly provided by Pfizer (Pfizer’s Compound Transfer Program).

Isolation of ganglion sensory neurons

Left and right whole L3–L5 DRG, T10-L1 DRG, NG/JG complex and TG tissue biopsies were dissected after perfusion of Pirt/TdTomato mice with phosphate buffer pH 7.3 (PB). Ganglion tissues were used for single-cell suspension generation as previously described

13

. Briefly, whole ganglia were treated with 125 μg/ml liberase (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 200 μg/ml dispase II (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in Hank’s solution for 60 min. Reaction was stopped by washing tissues with DMEM/L-glutamate/5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) media. Ganglia were dispersed to single-cell conditions by pipette and filtered through 100 μm strainer.

FACS was used to isolate all sensory neurons, which express TdTomato

13

. Consecutive gates were used to isolate Pirt/TdTomato

+

cells. First, debris was excluded by forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A) gating. Second, duplets and clumps were excluded by side scatter width (SSC-W) and side scatter area gate (SSC-A) gate. Third, dead cells were excluded by allophycocyanin-Cy7 (APC-Cy7) Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend). Forth, Prrt-tdT+ bright cells were gated in PE phycoerythrin (PE-A) channel and sorted. Two cycles of sorting, which provide > 90% purification of sensory neuronal fractions, were conducted on 5 laser FACS Aria-IIIu cell sorter equipped with 100 μm nozzle.

RNA was isolated from single-cell sensory neuron suspension using Qiagen RNeasy (Universal Mini Kit) as was previously described

74

. RNA (< 10 ng) quality was accessed after cDNA preparation using Fragment Analyzer Agilent 2100 Bioanalyer RNA 6000 Nano chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA-seq cDNA libraries from sensory neuronal fraction (3000–35,000 neurons depending on types of ganglia) were prepared using oligo dT according to SMART-seq-2 protocol

75

,

76

with previously described modifications

13

. cDNA libraries were subjected to quantification and subsequent 50 bp single read sequencing run with Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Each group have n = 4 samples. Depth of reads was 30–50 × 10

6

bp for each sample.

Transcriptomic data analyses and statistics

Sequencing data from all samples were processed in the same way as previously described

13

. Briefly, RNA-seq readings were de-multiplexed with CASAVA and the FastQ files were generated. Raw reads were aligned to mouse genome build mm9/UCSC hg19 using TopHat2 default settings

77

,

78

. The BAM files obtained after alignment were processed using HTSeq-count to obtain the counts per gene, and then converted to RPKM (Read Per Kilobase of gene length per Million reads of the library)

79

. Differentially expressing genes (DEGs) were identify using DESeq software after performing median normalization

80

. Quality control statistical analysis of outliers, intergroup variability, distribution levels, PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to statistically validate the experimental data. Multiple test controlling was performed with Benjamini–Hochberg procedure and adjusted

p

value (Padj) was generated. Criteria for selection of DEGs for the further analysis are following: > 5 RPKM, fold-change (FC) > 5 and statistical significance for DEGs as Padj < 0.05. This allows to select DEGs with high levels expression and significant difference in expression levels. DEGs were clustered according to biological processes using the PANTHER software (

http://www.pantherdb.org/

).

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on L3–L5 DRG, NG/JG complex and TG sections, and dura mater biopsies dissected from naïve male 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused mice. Cryo-section (25 μm) generation and IHC process were performed as described

22

,

36

. Whole-mount IHC on dura biopsies was carried out. Intact dura was fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer. Labeling with primary and secondary antibodies were done on submerged dura samples in wells of 12-well plates. IHC was simultaneously performed on 4–8 sections generated from 3 animals. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-CGRP rabbit polyclonal (Sigma; C8198; 1:300)

64

–

66

, anti-neurofilament H (NFH) chicken polyclonal antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA; cat: PCK-592P; 1:400)

67

, anti-PRL rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Bioss, Boston, MA; cat: BS-23763R; 1:200), anti-POMC rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Bioss, Boston, MA; cat: BS-1195R; 1:200), anti-POMC rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Bioss, Boston, MA; cat: BS-1195R; 1:200)

68

and anti-GH rabbit polyclonal antibodies (FabGennix; Frisco, TX; cat: GH-112AP; 1:200). After labeling with primary antibodies, sections and dura biopsies were incubated with species appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200; Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Control IHC was performed on tissue sections processed as described but either lacking primary antibodies or lacking primary and secondary antibodies.

Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X810 All-in-One Fluorescent Microscope (Keyence, Itasca, IL), a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a C1si laser scanning confocal imaging system or Zeiss (Carl Zeiss, Jena) LSM single photon confocal microscope. Images were processed with NIS-elements (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY), ZEN (Carl Zeiss, Jena) or Adobe Photoshop CS2 software. Gain setting was constant during acquisition, and it was established on no primary control slides. Cell counts from IHC images acquired as Z-stack were performed using Image J software. Total cells/section and positive cells were counted. Cell counting were performed independently by two investigators. We used 3 independent mice to generate sections and counted 3–5 sections per mouse. Thus, each group has n = 3, and data for each sample are represented by mean values from 3 to 5 sections generated per animal.

Dural, masseter muscle, hindpaw (intraplantar) and spinal cord (intrathecal) injections

Injection into hindpaw (i.e. intraplantar) was done as previously described

69

. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (v/v) for ≈20–30 s. The plantar surface of the footpad was cleaned with betadine and 70% ethanol. Solutions with hormones (10 μl) were injected using 1 ml-insuline syringe with 30-gauge needles into the metatarsal region of the hindpaw. Pressure on hindpaw was maintained several seconds after withdrawal of the needle.

Injection into spinal cord (i.e. intrathecal) was done as described

34

. Briefly, tissue above spinal L3–L5 levels was cleaned with betadine and 70% ethanol. The mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (v/v) for ≈1–1.5 min. Injection were performed with 30-gauge 1/2-inch needle mated to a 10-pl luer tip syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The needle is inserted into the tissue above L4 or L5 spinal levels so that it slips into the groove between the spinous and transverse processes. The needle is then moved carefully forward to the intervertebral space as the angle of the syringe is decreased to about 10°. The tip of the needle is inserted so that approximately 0.5 cm is within the vertebral column. Solutions with hormones (10 μl) were injected and the needle rotated on withdrawal.

Injection into masseter muscle were also performed on mice anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (v/v) for 1–1.5 min. The skin over masseter muscle was cleaned with betadine and 70% ethanol. Solutions with hormones (10 μl) were injected using 1 ml-insuline syringe with 30-gauge needles into region closer to tendinous aponeurosis of the superficial head of the masseter muscle.

Administrations of solutions to dura matter were performed according to previously published methods

70

. Briefly, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane for < 2 min and injected with 5 μl hormone solution using a modified internal cannula (Invivo1, part #8IC313ISPCXC, Internal Cannula, standard, 28 gauge, fit to 0.5 mm). The inner portion of the cannula was adjusted with calipers to extend from 0.5 to 0.65 mm in length. The cannulas were inserted through the soft tissue at the intersection of the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures.

Hypersensitivity testing of the hindpaws, periorbital skin and V2 facial skin area over masseter muscle

All experimenters performing testing on mice and data analysis were done blinded for all behavior experiments. Allocation of animals to treatment groups was randomized by a “blinder” that drew animal numbers from a bag of paper slips. Mice were habituated to the testing environment for at least 1 h prior to nociception measurements on the hindpaw. Heat-induced nociception was measured using an automated Hargreaves’ apparatus as previously described

71

. Mechanical stimulus-induced nociception following the intraplantar injection was assessed by determining paw withdrawal threshold using up-down von Frey method

72

.

Mechanical hypersensitivity in head and neck area was performed on unrestrained animals

70

,

73

. To reduce any effects of restraint by hands or grasping the tail, mice were habituated

73

. For measurements of mechanical hypersensitivity following masseter muscle injection, sequence of following procedures was carried out. First, naïve mice were placed in a black wire mesh box (4 × 4 × 4″) and allowed to freely move for ≈1 h. This procedure was repeated 3 days. Next, test von Frey filament probing of V2 facial skin area over masseter muscle was applied to each mouse for 3–4 consecutive days. Each grade of von Frey filament was applied 3 times at intervals of a few seconds. The stimulation always began with the filament producing the lowest force and stopped when mice are responded to 3 consecutive stimulations with a graded von Frey filament. A brisk or active withdrawal of the head from the probing filament was defined as a response. Mice with mechanical threshold > 0.6 g at V2 facial skin area, which is considered baseline mechanical nociception, were selected for drug/hormone injection. After injection into masseter muscle, mechanical hypersensitivity was regularly assessed for 1 week.

Headache-like behavior following dura injection were assessed as described

70

. To habituate mice, they were placed in 4 oz paper cups (Choice) for 2 h a day for 3 consecutive days. von Frey testing of the periorbital skin (the midline of the forehead at the level of the eyes), which is used to assess headache-like behavior, was carried out on each mouse located in a paper cup for the 3–4 consecutive post-habituation days. Baselined animals were defined as animals that exhibited a withdrawal threshold > 0.6 g. Mice with a baseline threshold < 0.6 g at the end of 3 habituation days and 4 test days were excluded from experiments. After application of drug/hormone to dura, mechanical thresholds were regularly determined for 1 week by applying von Frey filaments to the periorbital skin in an ascending/descending manner starting from the 0.02 g filament. If the animal responded to this filament, decreasing forces were applied until the 0.008 g filament was reached.

Statistical analysis

GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analyses. Data in the figures are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), with “n” referring to the number of analyzed mice for IHC or behavioral experiments. Statistical changes between 2 or more groups with two variables were analyzed by regular 2-way ANOVA with Sidak’s post-hoc tests. A difference is accepted as statistically significant when

p

< 0.05. Number of animals in a group, interaction F ratios, and the associated

p

values are reported.

Ethical approval and informed consent

All experimental protocols were approved by the UTHSCSA IACUC committee. Protocol numbers are 20190114AR and 20190083AR.

#### EFCAB6 - Article 5: Fetal-Adult Cardiac Transcriptome Analysis in Rats with Contrasting Left Ventricular Mass Reveals New Candidates for Cardiac Hypertrophy
<Date>: 2015-2-3
<PMCID>: 4315412
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) is a major sign of cardiac adaption to high blood pressure and the most common cause of cardiac hypertrophy [

1

]. Due to the high prevalence of arterial hypertension, LVH will soon become the most common risk factor for cardiac failure worldwide [

2

].

However, independent of blood pressure, LVH alone profoundly affects morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases [

3

–

5

]. It is still poorly understood why only one part of hypertensive patients develop LVH over time. Family and population studies demonstrated that LV mass variation is clearly influenced by genetic factors [

6

,

7

]. This is also supported by genetic analysis of inbred rat models, including hypertensive rat strains [

8

,

9

].

Reactivation of fetal gene expression patterns has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in common cardiac diseases in adult life including LVH [

10

]. Thus, increased wall stress and neurohumoral activation are discussed to induce the return to expression of fetal genes after birth in LVH [

11

]. The switch from adult α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform to fetal β-MHC isoform is a well-known process during cardiac hypertrophy [

12

]. Reinducing glucose metabolism under low oxygen supply in hypertrophied hearts is a further example for cardiac adaption processes [

13

,

14

].

In the presented work we aimed to test whether fetal gene expression programs are linked to the genetic predisposition to LVH. We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in a genetic rat model of LVH, i.e. the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP), and in the normotensive rat strain Fischer (F344). SHRSP is a well-established model of polygenetic hypertension and hypertensive organ damage, including LVH. F344 was chosen as an inbred normotensive contrasting rat strain to SHRSP, because F344 exhibit a significantly lower cardiac mass compared to the historical comparator, i.e. Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) [

15

] and might be therefore more informative in comparison to SHRSP than WKY. In addition, F344 is recommended by the National Institute on Aging and the National Centre for Toxicological Research in the US as a reference strain in aging studies including cardiovascular investigations [

16

]. Consequently, F344 was used as comparative strain for an earlier genetic quantitative trait linkage (QTL)-mapping study in a complementary project [

17

]. Based on their contrasting phenotype we tested the hypothesis that the fetal expression patterns between day 20 of development (E20) and week 14 in adult animals show differences between SHRSP and F344. By using this novel approach we aimed to identify potential candidates that are involved in the development of LVH.

Methods

Animals

All rats were obtained from our colonies at the Forschungseinrichtung für experimentelle Medizin (FEM), Charité—Universitätsmedizin, Berlin. SHRSP rats and WKY rats from these colonies were previously described [

18

,

19

] and breeder pairs of F344 rats were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.) to establish a new colony at our facility. The total number of male animals studied were for SHRSP E20 n = 7, week 14 n = 8, for F344 E20 n = 8, week 14 n = 8, and for WKY E20 n = 8, week 14 n = 17. Rats were grouped under a 12:12h light/dark cycle using an automated light switching device and climate-controlled conditions at 22°C. Adult rats at week 14 and maternal animals were fed a normal-salt diet (0.2% NaCl). All animal experiments were approved by the government committee in accordance with national animal protection guidelines (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (LAGeSo) Berlin, Germany).

At week 14 of age animals were weighed and sacrificed under a ketamine (Ketanest S, Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany)/xylazine (Rompun, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) anaesthesia (87 mg/kg and 13 mg/kg body weight, respectively).

Fetuses on stage E20 were dissected from the uterus and immediately killed by decapitation. Maternal animals were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany) and sacrificed by removing the heart.

Phenotyping

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured at week 14 in conscious animals by the tail-cuff method, which has been previously validated and reported [

20

]. In brief, two training periods were performed on two separate days. Subsequently, the final blood pressure measurements were recorded on three consecutive days. Due to three sets of two measurements at each session, the individual blood pressure phenotype was based on a maximum of 18 measurements for each rat. A minimum of 12 measurements was required for inclusion in the analysis, which was achieved in all animals.

For determination of cardiac hypertrophy the hearts at week 14 were arrested in diastole by rinsing in 1 M KCl and subsequently carefully blotted dry. The atria were trimmed away and the mass of the whole heart was determined by weighting to the nearest milligram. Removed hearts of E20 animals were rinsed in 1 M KCL and dissected by removing the atria. Hearts were weighted in total to the nearest milligram. In adult hearts LV was separated from septum and right ventricle for RNA isolation. Both ventricles were used for RNA isolation in E20 rats.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

RNA was isolated from the free wall LV with a trizol assay (TRIzol, Invitrogen Life Technologies) in week 14. Atria free hearts in state E20 were processed with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and concentration of the purified total RNA were confirmed by spectroscopy (Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA)

First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on 2μg of total RNA in a 20μl reaction using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas Life Sciences, St Leon-Rot, Germany) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Microarray analysis

Microarray analysis was performed in SHRSP and F344 samples in individual samples, thus no pooled data were analyzed. For gene expression profiling Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip with 22523 probes per array was used. Biotinylated, amplified RNA for direct hybridization was generated using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Raw data pre-processing was executed with Genome Studio (Illumina, Version 1.9.0) creating the probe and control profile and the sample information file for further analyses in R (R Core Team. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. 2013) Quality control and ongoing data processing was performed with package 'lumi' [

21

]. A log2-transformation and quantile normalization was applied to the data. For differential expression analysis we used the adequately supplied methods from package 'limma' [

22

]. T-statistics and log-odds of differential expression with empirical Bayes were computed and adjusted with Benjamini & Hochberg. Microarray data is deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus and available under accession number GSE53512. For functional annotation Gene Ontology Categories [

23

] were used. Pathways are annotated corresponding to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [

24

].

mRNA expression analysis

To quantify mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (Nppa), potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 1 (Kcne1), EF-hand calcium binding domain 6 (Efcab6), cytoplasmic epoxide hydrolase 2 (Ephx2), caspase recruitment domain family, member 9 (Card9), and defensin beta 1 (Defb1) in heart tissue, we used the quantitative Real time PCR (qPCR) method. Appropriate custom-made primers were designed with the Primer Express software and obtained by TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Oligonucleotide sequences are presented in

S1 Table

. The ABI PRISM 7000 SDS instrument and the Power Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) were used to perform the assays according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Relative quantification was done using the ΔΔ-ct method. Every sample was measured in triplicate. To normalize our expression data, we used hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) as a house-keeping gene.

Statistical analysis

All data were summarized as means ± SD and differences between strains were analyzed by student’s T-Test and ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni adjustments if not stated otherwise. Differences were considered significant at the level of p < 0.05.

Results

Phenotype

SHRSP showed significantly higher SBP values at week 14 compared to F344 as expected (

Fig. 1

, panel A). Relative heart weight measurements confirmed significant differences between the three rat strains SHRSP, WKY and F344 at week 14. In state E20 heart weight values were not significantly different (

Fig. 1

, panel B).

Comparison of mean systolic blood pressure (panel A) and relative heart weight (panel B) between F344 strain (white bars, E20 n = 8, week 14 n = 8), WKY strain (grey bars, E20 n = 5, week 14 n = 17) and SHRSP (black bars, E20 n = 7, week 14 n = 1) at state E20 and at week 14, respectively. Values are means ± SD, * p < 0.05 vs. F344 at week 14, ** p < 0.05 vs. F344 and WKY at week 14, respectively.

Regulation of fetal genes

Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4), Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) and 2 (Pdk2) as known regulated fetal genes in development showed the expected expression changes during development between E20 and week 14 in SHRSP as well as in F344 in microarray analysis (logFC > |1.5|, p < 0.05). Skeletal alpha actin (Acta1) was regulated in F344 only (logFC = 2.66, p < 0.05) and Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Mlycd) showed only a SHRSP specific regulation (logFC = -1.76, p < 0.05). In

S2 Table

in the supporting information we summarized the expression patterns of known regulated fetal genes in cardiac development.

Classification of differentially expressed genes

In microarray quality control we demanded intragroup correlation coefficients of expression intensities > 0.95. Samples with lower correlation were removed leaving us with four samples of group SHRSP E20, seven of F344 E20, seven of SHRSP week 14 and eight of F344 week 14. Altogether, 15232 expressed transcripts were detectable below a confident detection threshold of 0.05 and examined for differential gene expression.

For the identification of new potential candidate genes for LVH, we first calculated differentially expressed genes between SHRSP and F344 animals at week 14. Therefore, we applied the 'lmFit' function from package 'limma' of Bioconductor on normalized expression data. Statistics were computed with the 'eBayes' function and p-values were adjusted with False Discovery Rate of Benjamini & Hochberg. For further bioinformatic analysis we considered probes with log fold changes > 1.5 or < -1.5, resulting in 45 transcripts. In SHRSP 24 transcripts showed an up-regulation and 21 transcripts a down-regulation as compared to F344 (log FC > |1.5| and p < 0.05). 40 probes could be annotated with gene name and chromosomal position. A heat map with two-dimensional hierarchical clustering elucidates the expression patterns for the 40 annotated genes over all SHRSP and F344 samples in

Fig. 2

Fig 2

Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes.

Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes (log fold change > |1.5| and p < 0.01) between SHRSP and F344 in week 14 over all samples. Samples (columns) and genes (rows) are grouped by their expression profile. Expression values are scaled by Z-Score with zero mean and standard deviation of 1. Values above the mean are shown in red, equivalent to the mean are colored in yellow and below the mean in white. Animal samples of F344 E20 (n = 7), F344 week 14 (n = 8), SHRSP E20 (n = 4) and SHRSP week 14 (n = 7) are in order at the bottom.

To unveil biological functions and cellular processes of these genes we used Gene Ontology terms by which 36 genes could be assigned with at least one term (

S1 Fig.

) To reveal potential LVH susceptibility genes, we chose a new approach to reduce the earlier detected gene group of 40 specifically expressed probes. Therefore, we analyzed developmental expression patterns in each strain between the time points E20 and week 14 of these genes. Fold change limits were set > 1.5 or < -1.5 as described before. Generally, there were no candidates detected because of a discordant expression with an up-regulation between E20 and week 14 in SHRSP and a down-regulation between E20 and week 14 in F344 or vice versa. In SHRSP 8 genes with a significant differential expression in week 14 compared with F344 showed also a strain specific significant differential expression pattern during development between SHRSP E20 and SHRSP at week 14. In the F344 strain 10 genes with significant differential expression in week 14 compared with SHRSP and during F344 specific development were identified. 3 genes were identified in both strains showing a significant differential expression between E20 and week 14. However, our approach prioritized 5 genes as potential candidates for LVH because they showed only in the hypertensive SHRSP rat a differential expression in comparison with F344 at week 14 and a differential expression pattern during development as well. In contrast the remaining 7 transcripts with F344 specific differential expression were evaluated as less relevant for LVH. Thus, we decided to further explore Kcne1, Efcab6 Ephx2, Card9, and Defb1.

Values in the italic written column indicate significantly differentially expressed genes by comparing SHRSP and F344 in week 14 (SHRSP vs. F344). Negative fold changes demonstrate a down-regulation in SHRSP strain. LogFC values in the middle and right columns indicate gene expression by comparing SHRSP E20 and SHRSP in week 14 (E20 vs. week 14, middle column) and F344 E20 and F344 in week 14 (E20 vs. week 14, right column). Negative prefixes indicate a down-regulation in E20. Microarray chip probe ID with annotated gene symbol is indicated if available. Significantly differentially expressed genes with logFC > 1.5 by comparing the strains SHRSP and F344 in week 14 as well as by comparing animals in E20 and week 14 are given in bold. Validated candidate genes are labelled with asterisk.

A mapping of Gene Ontology Terms revealed immune system associated functions for Card9 and Defb1 (e.g. ‘positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade’, Gene Ontology Term number (GO): 0005737 and ‘innate immune response’, GO:0045087 for Defb1). Ephx2 could be mapped to ‘catalytic activity’ (GO: 0003824), ‘metabolic process (GO: 0008152)’ or ‘lipid phosphatase activity’ (GO: 0042577) among others. For Efcab6 only one term was found, i.e. ‘calcium ion binding’ (GO: 0005509). Terms like ‘heart contraction’ (GO: 0060047), ‘plasma membrane’ (GO: 0005886) and ‘regulation of heart rate by cardiac conduction’ (GO: 0086091) are assigned to Kcne1. Pathway annotation was only available for two of the five genes; Card9 is involved in the 'NOD-like receptor signalling pathway', whereas Ephx2 is associated with 'Arachidonic acid metabolism', 'Metabolic pathways' and ‘Peroxisome’.

Verification by qPCR

We performed qPCR analysis for validation of potential candidate genes identified in the microarray analysis. We measured mRNA expression of the known cardiac hypertrophy marker Nppa as positive control. Additionally, we used WKY samples as second control strain to distinguish strain dependent effects.

In week 14 Nppa, Kcne1, Efcab6 and Defb1 showed the highest mRNA levels in SHRSP in comparison with F344 and WKY animals of the same age by qPCR analysis. In this comparison SHRSP animals presented at least a 40% higher expression for these genes compared to both F344 and WKY (p < 0.05, respectively).

In contrast, Ephx2 and Card9 were significant lower (-77%, p < 0.001) or similarly (-6%, p = 0.43) expressed in SHRSP at week 14 in comparison with F344 in qPCR analysis. WKY animals at week 14 showed at least a 30% higher expression for these two genes compared to SHRSP animals (p < 0.01, respectively).

The demonstrated regulation between E20 and week 14 in SHRSP and F344 by microarray analysis could be confirmed by qPCR for Kcne1, Efcab6 and Ephx2. Kcne1, Efcab6 and Ephx2 showed in qPCR analysis an up-regulation of gene expression in SHRSP between E20 and week 14 (p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, expression value changes during development of these genes were not significant in F344. WKY animals showed up-regulation of Kcne1 as well as of Ephx2 and down-regulation of Efcab6 (p < 0.01, respectively). Defb1 gene expression in E20 was too low for further qPCR analysis.

Card9 was significantly regulated in both of the normotensive control strains (p < 0.05) but not in SHRSP (p > 0.5). Card9 showed discrepant expression values in microarray (significant up-regulation in SHRSP in week 14) and qPCR analysis and was therefore excluded as a candidate, because the detected significant up-regulation in SHRSP week 14 compared to corresponding F344 in microarray analysis was not confirmed by qPCR analysis.

Discussion

In this study we used a multi-stage approach to identify genes potentially involved in the development of LVH phenotype by comparing gene expression patterns of two contrasting strains (SHRSP versus F344) and two development stages (fetal E20 versus adult week 14). Our microarray analysis revealed 5 genes as potential candidates for LVH.

As the first step to assess gene expression, we used Illumina BeadArray technology with more than 22k transcripts. 15232 probes were detected as expressed (p < 0.05) and screened for differential expression. Subsequently, we validated our results with qPCR.

We tested Nppa encoding atrial natriuretic peptide as classical marker for LVH as positive control. As expected SHRSP rats at week 14 showed the highest Nppa expression values compared to F344 in microarray analysis (logFC = 2.78, p < 0.001) and in qPCR analysis compared with F344 (+630% compared to F344 at week 14, p < 0.01) and with WKY (+38% of WKY, p < 0.05).

We aimed to identify differences in fetal-adult cardiac expression programs by contrasting two informative rat strains. Our validation experiments do not show similar consistent expression differences between SHRSP and the two normotensive control strains.

Efcab6 and Kcne1 showed the highest gene expression in SHRSP at week 14 and a strong up-regulation during SHRSP development in comparison with both normotensive control strains in qPCR gene expression determination. Efcab6 showed 82% and 76% higher expression in adult SHRSP than in adult F344 and WKY. Efcab6 encodes for EF-hand calcium binding domain 6 and belongs to the large and diverse calcium regulating EF-hand superfamily; the EF-hand calcium binding motif was identified with functional importance in heart diseases in earlier studies [

25

,

26

]. Efcab6 is a poorly described transcript and was identified earlier in human as DJBP an oncogene binding partner [

27

]. A functional role of Efcab6 was not described to our knowledge.

Kcne1 showed in SHRSP and WKY an increase of gene expression during development but a decrease in F344 by comparing qPCR results. Maximum expression values in SHRSP at week 14 were at least about two fold higher than in the two normotensive strains. The influence of Kcne1 in heart failure was previously reported [

28

]. The strong regulation of Kcne1 resulting in high expression in week 14 may point out to an important adaption process during LVH development in SHRSP.

The further detected candidate gene Ephx2 was previously reported as a promising candidate for cardiac hypertrophy in rodents and patients [

29

,

30

]. Elevated Ephx2 expression values were associated with heart failure in rats [

30

]. However, in cardiac tissue of heart failure patients Ephx2 expression was found to be down-regulated [

30

]. Similarly, in our work Ephx2 gene expression was at least about 40% lower in SHRSP than in the control strains F344 or WKY, respectively. Furthermore, earlier studies identified Ephx2 as interesting drug target in heart failure [

31

,

32

]. Its influence on epoxyeicosatrienoic acids homeostasis has been suggested to modulate cardiac function but the mechanism is still not completely understood and needs to be clarified in further studies [

30

,

31

]. The latter is important, since our study does per se not allow differentiating whether the identified candidates are primarily, i.e. causative, involved in the development of LVH or whether they are related to cardiac adaption processes resulting in larger heart size in SHRSP [

33

]. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes could be still a general sign for genomic strain differences without relevance for cardiac hypertrophy development.

The basis of our study is the phenotypical difference between F344 and SHRSP in blood pressure and heart weight. In this regard it is important to consider the well-known influence of elevated blood pressure on gene regulation [

34

]. Thus, differences in cardiac gene expression in adult animals might occur as secondary changes in response to the elevated blood pressure. A follow-up study is therefore needed where the effect of blood pressure on the target genes, e.g. by reducing blood pressure in SHRSP to the same level as F344, could be investigated.

As a limitation of our study gene expression was measured in total LV tissue in adult and in whole heart samples of fetal E20 animals. Thus, we did not differentiate between right and LV tissue in E20 animals, although it should not be dismissed that the hemodynamic exposure of cardiac ventricles in E20 animals is per se quite different from the adult animals.

In light of the fact that both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts play an important role in LVH development and cardiac remodelling [

35

–

37

] our data do not allow distinguishing expression profiles between the two cell types. Furthermore, although the left ventricle is the primary and main target for hypertensive end organ damage, differences in gene expression profiles between cardiac tissues from the ventricle and atria have been reported earlier in addition to differences between cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblast [

38

–

41

].

We used only Hprt as house-keeping gene in qPCR analyses. Although Hprt is an established house-keeping gene in cardiac gene expression studies [

42

,

43

] and our data demonstrated only a low variability of Hprt expression between the analyzed strains and age groups, the use of additional house-keeping genes could have increased the validity of our analysis [

44

].

A further limitation is related to the fact that we measured heart weight and gene expression on two time points only, i.e. state E20 and week 14 as development time points of late gestation age and young adulthood, respectively. In this regard it is of interest, that a high cardiac metabolic gene expression including mitochondrial biogenesis genes and glucose transporter Glut-1 in rats at gestation age of E20 with a subsequent decrease has been reported [

45

]. The chosen time distance might also be an explanation for the observation that a significant differential expression of the known markers for cardiac development like Myh6 and Myh7 were missed in our analysis. Furthermore we could detect strain dependent difference in developmental regulation for Acta1 and Mlycd. The expression of these fetal genes may therefore be influenced by factors including cardiac mechanical influences that differ between the two analyzed rat strains [

46

]. Nevertheless we could verify representative markers for transcriptional changes in cardiac development in both strains [

11

].

The regulation of Nppa and F344 specific genes are discussed in the

S1 Discussion Appendix

.

To our knowledge, in this work we report a new approach to identify candidate genes for cardiac hypertrophy by analyzing both gene expression differences between strains with contrasting cardiac phenotype in combination with a comparison of cardiac fetal-adult gene expression patterns in the same strains. We thus identified Efcab6 as new potential candidate gene for the LVH phenotype and confirmed earlier published candidate genes. The functional relevance of the identified candidate genes for LVH needs to be tested in future studies, to exclude the possibility that their observed expression difference is solely related to a genetic inter-strain difference without functional relevance for LVH. Further validation and functional experiments are necessary to confirm these targets and new mechanisms related to cardiac hypertrophy.

S1 Discussion Appendix

A down-regulation of Nppa expression after birth in rat hearts has been previously described [

47

] and F344 exhibited lower Nppa expression in adult compared to E20 animals by qPCR analysis.

In contrast, LV Nppa expression increased in adult animals at week 14 compared to E20 animals in both SHRSP and WKY. This finding could be related to the smaller cardiac growth and/or adaptive cardiac response during aging in the F344 strain compared to both SHRSP and WKY. In addition, expression values of Nppa were significantly higher in E20 animals of F344 as compared to SHRSP (+ 20%, p < 0.01) which could point to a possible cardiac developmental mismatch between the two strains resulting in different cardiac expression patterns. Genes that showed a specific expression pattern with up-regulation only in F344, e.g. Adhfe1, were not further examined in the presented work, because we prioritized our analysis on up-regulated genes in SHRSP. Thus, potential candidate genes with LVH preventing function were not validated and could be studied in the further.

### Gene: LARGE1 (5 articles)

#### LARGE1 - Article 1: Exogenous expression of the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 restores α-dystroglycan matriglycan and laminin binding in rhabdomyosarcoma
<Date>: 2019-5-4
<PMCID>: 6500046
<Full Text Content>:
Background

Dystroglycan is a ubiquitously expressed extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor and plays key roles in the formation and maintenance of many tissues [

1

]. In skeletal muscle, dystroglycan is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which establishes a continuous link between the laminin-G-like (LG) domain-containing ECM proteins and the intracellular cytoskeleton. The key role that the DGC plays in muscle function is highlighted by the fact that mutations in almost any gene encoding one of its components can cause muscular dystrophy [

2

]. Furthermore, mutations in a single component of the DGC can result in instability and loss of the entire complex, highlighting the requirement for the complex to be intact.

Similarly, loss of dystroglycan function has been associated with human pathologies, including muscular dystrophy with or without various degrees of brain and eye defects [

1

]. Dystroglycan is synthesized as a single precursor that is subsequently cleaved into two subunits that remain tightly but non-covalently linked: the cell surface-associated α-dystroglycan and the membrane-spanning β-dystroglycan. α-Dystroglycan functions as a receptor for several LG domain-containing basement membrane proteins, including laminin [

3

–

5

], perlecan [

6

], agrin [

7

], and Slit [

8

], whereas β-dystroglycan binds to proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization (dystrophin and utrophin) [

9

–

11

]. α-Dystroglycan requires extensive glycosylation and post-translational processing in order to bind to its extracellular ligands. This functional glycosylation consists of the unique heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-beta1,3-Xyl-alpha1,3-]

n

called matriglycan, which has been reported only on α-dystroglycan and binds with high-affinity to ECM proteins that contain LG domains. In humans, mutations in any of the genes coding for the glycosyltransferases involved in this process can lead to a spectrum of syndromes known as secondary dystroglycanopathies. These conditions are characterized by an absence or reduction in the matriglycan modification on α-dystroglycan and by muscular dystrophy with or without brain and eye defects.

We and others have demonstrated that glycosylation of α-dystroglycan is also compromised in a wide variety of cancers, and that this defect correlates with poor prognosis [

12

–

16

]. An analysis of knockout mouse models for two of the DGC components, dystrophin (

mdx

) and α-sarcoglycan, demonstrated that primary defects in the DGC are sometimes associated with the formation of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) [

17

]. Specifically, among aged (> 1 year old) mice deficient for dystrophin (

mdx

) or α-sarcoglycan, 21% (32/150) and 5% (4/80) of mice developed such tumors, respectively. Mdx-derived tumors display both cellular and molecular characteristics of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS) and almost no characteristics of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS).

Biochemical evidence supporting the involvement of α-dystroglycan in RMS comes from a manuscript reporting on five RMS tumors, which found the expression of α-dystroglycan to be reduced or absent while that of β-dystroglycan was normal [

18

]. Parallel studies of human RMS have indicated that dystrophin may have roles as a tumor suppressor [

19

].

In the study described here, we expand on the above-described investigations by describing a functional role for dystroglycan in RMS, and begin to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its altered function. Analysis of a microarray panel containing eRMS and aRMS tissue revealed that matriglycan levels on α-dystroglycan are reduced in both sample types. Similarly, analysis of cell lines derived from human and mouse RMS shows that in a subset of these cell lines, α-dystroglycan lacks matriglycan, and that this is accompanied by reduced expression of the glycosyltransferase LARGE1. Lastly, we found that ectopic expression of

LARGE1

in RMS cells restored both the matriglycan modification of α-dystroglycan and the ability of α-dystroglycan to bind laminin, demonstrating that the loss of

LARGE1

expression causes the lack of matriglycan and a loss of high-affinity laminin binding in RMS.

Methods

Experimental replicates

All experiments were repeated in the laboratory three times. Data reported are representative.

Cell culture

Primary cells from genetically engineered mouse aRMS samples were cultured as previously described [

20

,

21

]. The collection of tumors and the culture of primary cells from human RMS were performed under an IRB approved protocol from Oregon Health & Science University. In brief, for each culture, the tumor was minced and digested with collagenase (10 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The dissociated cells were then incubated in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 5% CO

2

at 37 °C. Experiments were performed at or before passage 10.

were cloned into replication-deficient adeno-viral (Ad5) vectors. Adenovirus was generated by the Viral Vector Core at the University of Iowa. The generation of Ad5 constructs was described previously [

5

]. Cancer cells were grown to 70–80% confluency in 48-well or 10 cm plates, and were infected with Ad5 constructs at an MOI of 3 in the corresponding complete medium 48 h after infection.

cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cells in culture using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA using the AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche) and a combination of random hexamers and polyA primers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each of the target genes was amplified in real-time from cDNA using oligonucleotides specific to that gene (sequences and conditions available upon request), with 28S-RNA, Rpl27, and Rpl4 used as the normalization controls. cDNA levels were determined using SYBR green in a MyiQ rt-PCR detection system (BioRad). All samples were run in triplicate.

Western blotting

Proteins were extracted from cultured cells using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and protease inhibitor cocktail in 1x PBS). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000×

g

for 15 min. The solubilized supernatant was added to 200 μl of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) slurry (Vector Labs) and the samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The pelleted WGA beads were washed three times with 1 ml TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After the final wash, 250 μl of loading buffer (loading sample buffer (LSB)) was added to the beads. The samples were heated to 99 °C for 10 min before loading into 3–15% SDS–PAGE gels, and protein was subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, which were subsequently blocked in 2% nonfat dried milk in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). All antibodies were diluted in the same buffer that was used for blocking. Membranes were washed in TBST buffer. Blots were developed with IR-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and scanned using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE). α-Dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan core proteins were detected using antibody AF6868, and matriglycan was detected using antibody IIH6 [

22

,

23

]. Electrophoresis was performed by standard SDS-PAGE methods. Precision Plus Protein™ (BioRad) was used as the molecular weight marker for Western blot analysis.

Laminin overlay assay

Ligand overlay assays were performed on membranes using mouse Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm (EHS) laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) [

24

]. Briefly, PVDF membranes were blocked in laminin binding buffer (LBB: 10 mM triethanolamine, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl

2

, 1 mM CaCl

2

, pH 7.6) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) followed by incubation with laminin overnight at 4 °C in LBB. Membranes were washed and incubated with anti-laminin antibody (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100) followed by Licor dye-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG.

Solid-phase assay

WGA eluates were diluted 1:50 in TBS and coated on polystyrene ELISA microplates (Costar) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed in LBB and blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA in LBB. Mouse EHS laminin was diluted in LBB and applied for 2 h. Wells were washed with 3% BSA in LBB and incubated for 30 min with anti-laminin antibody (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000 dilution) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, 1:5000 dilution). Plates were developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and H

, and then reactions were stopped with 2 N H

SO

. Absorbance per well was read at 490 nm by a microplate reader.

Results

A previous study showed a loss of fully glycosylated α-dystroglycan in the majority of RMS samples from a small cohort; notably, the expression of β-dystroglycan, with which α-dystroglycan is co-translated, was not significantly altered [

18

]. Since the publication of that work in 2007, our understanding of the intricate glycosylation and post-translational processing events required to synthesize the functional form of α-dystroglycan has progressed significantly. In order to validate these results and expand the glycobiological analysis, we performed Western blotting using two distinct antibodies that recognize α-dystroglycan: “anti-core dystroglycan,” a polyclonal antibody that has specificity for epitopes along the backbones of both α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan, and thus does not depend on glycosylation status; and monoclonal antibody IIH6 (anti-matriglycan), which binds α-dystroglycan only when it has been modified with matriglycan by LARGE [

25

]. The Western blot results are complemented by a laminin overlay assay, which measures the ability of α-dystroglycan to bind laminin with high-affinity.

The first sample-set tested was the Children’s Oncology Group Lookback tissue microarray (P1542), which includes both aRMS and eRMS subtypes. Nearly all eRMS and aRMS samples that were examined were negative for IIH6 staining, whereas normal skeletal muscle was positive (Fig.

1

a–c). To determine whether the lack of matriglycan immunoreactivity in rhabdomyosarcomas reflects the loss of the core α-dystroglycan protein or a defect in its processing, we next analyzed RMS tumors by immunoblotting. In all of the samples tested, bands representing both α-dystroglycan (120–140 kDa) and β-dystroglycan (~ 43 kDa) were present (Fig.

1

d). However, the two eRMS samples, as well as one of the aRMS samples, showed loss of both matriglycan immunoreactivity (Fig.

1

e) and laminin binding (Fig.

1

f). These results demonstrate that although the expression of dystroglycan is generally maintained in RMS tumors, the mature form of the protein is not always present.

We next sought to develop a cell culture model for biochemical and expression studies. We first tested a mouse aRMS cell line (U23674) for functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan and the expression of various enzymes involved in this process. We found that although the amounts of α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan in this line were similar to those in the C2C12 normal muscle cell line and in mouse skeletal muscle (Fig.

2

a), matriglycan immunoreactivity and laminin binding were lower than in both controls (Fig.

2

b, c). Notably, comparing the expression of genes encoding glycosyltransferases that are known to modify α-dystroglycan in the U23674 vs C2C12 line did not reveal any changes large enough to explain the observed reduction in matriglycan immunoreactivity (Fig.

2

d); based on our experience assessing changes in the expression of such genes in cell culture, only a reduction to 20% or less results in measurable α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation. Since we could not rule out the existence of inactivating mutations in any of these genes, we further tested U23674 cells for functional complementation by overexpressing individual glycosyltransferases. For this purpose, we infected these cells with adeno-viral vectors coding for each of the known α-dystroglycan-modifying glycosyltransferases (individually) and tested the glycosylation status of α-dystroglycan using the anti-matriglycan antibody. Of these,

LARGE1

was the only gene tested whose expression was able to restore matriglycan immunoreactivity (Fig.

2

We then analyzed two cell lines obtained from human eRMS tumors (PCB82 and PCB232) and one from an aRMS tumor (PCB380). All three cell lines produced bands that were detected by the anti-core dystroglycan antibody (Fig.

a). However, matriglycan immunoreactivity was low compared to that in C2C12 muscle cells (Fig.

b) and laminin binding was nearly eliminated (Fig.

However, when RT-PCR analysis was used to compare expression of the glycosyltransferases in these three cell lines, no decreases in expression were sufficient to explain the reduced matriglycan immunoreactivity and laminin binding that were detected (Fig.

We next interrogated a publicly available RNAseq dataset of RMS biopsies and cell lines [

B3GALNT2

and

LARGE1

. Whereas

B3GALNT2

was downregulated in both ARMS and ERMS biopsies but not the corresponding cell lines,

LARGE1

was downregulated specifically in the ERMS cells and biopsy samples. For further studies, we selected two highly utilized human RMS cell lines from this panel: Rh18 (eRMS), which expresses low levels of

LARGE1

; and Rh41 (aRMS), which expresses

LARGE1

at normal levels. Analysis of both cell lines revealed that Rh18 is nearly devoid of functional α-dystroglycan as reflected by a lack of matriglycan and by a loss of activity in the laminin overlay assay (Fig.

a–c). Notably, these defects were accompanied by a nearly complete loss of

LARGE1

expression (Fig.

Lastly, we tested whether ectopic expression of recombinant

in Rh18 cells is sufficient to restore the modification of α-dystroglycan with matriglycan. To this end, we transduced Rh18 cells with particles produced by an adeno-viral vector encoding LARGE1 (Ad-LG1) and compared the resulting cells to the parental (non-transduced) line (Fig.

). We found that Rh18-LG1 cells produced a form of α-dystroglycan whose MW (150–200 kDa) (Fig.

overexpression restored both the addition of matriglycan onto α-dystroglycan (Fig.

Discussion

The DGC plays a well-established role in the formation, function, and regeneration of skeletal muscle fibers. The importance of this complex is highlighted by the muscle pathology observed in individuals with germline mutations in the genes encoding components of this complex and the glycosyltransferases involved in the modification of α-dystroglycan. Based on studies performed in both animal models and tumor samples, the DGC has also been suggested to contribute to the development of RMS [

17

,

18

].

The first indication that the DGC might play a role in RMS was the high frequency of this type of tumor in mice deficient for α-sarcoglycan and dystrophin, two central components of the DGC. In addition, a study of dystroglycan in pediatric cancers showed that α-dystroglycan is misprocessed in a subset of human patients with RMS, although the exact mechanism was not determined [

19

]. In the current study, we have expanded on these findings by analyzing tumor samples and cell lines derived from mouse and human RMS. We show that both eRMS and aRMS tumors retain expression of the α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan subunits, but that α-dystroglycan is not modified with matriglycan, the heteropolysaccharide that confers its ligand-binding ability. Given that abnormal glycosylation has been observed in many other cancer types and is correlated with a poor prognosis [

12

–

15

], we extended this study to a series of cell lines derived from mouse and human RMS tumors. This revealed that the reduction in matriglycan levels is a common feature in cell lines derived from both mouse and human RMS.

In epithelium-derived cancers, downregulation of glycosyltransferase expression has been found to underlie abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan [

14

,

15

,

27

]. Strikingly, although a reduction in

LARGE1

expression could account for the observed loss of matriglycan in particular, in certain RMS cases the collective decrease in the expression of several genes coding for α-dystroglycan-modifying glycosyltransferases is substantial, although this decrease varies across tumor types. This heterogeneity is consistent with other factors affecting the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan in RMS. On the other hand, ectopic expression of

LARGE1

in cell lines that are characterized by a lack of matriglycan modification on α-dystroglycan can restore both the modification (similar to levels in cell lines derived from skeletal muscle) and the ability of α-dystroglycan to function as a laminin receptor.

We previously reported that

LARGE1

is repressed in many epithelial cancer-derived cell lines, and showed that its ectopic expression reduces the invasiveness of such cells [

13

]. LARGE1 synthesizes and transfers repeating units of [-GlcA-beta1,3-Xyl-alpha1,3-]

n

onto α-dystroglycan [

28

], forming the terminal glycan moiety anchored by the Core M3 structure on α-dystroglycan. This structure resembles the ligand-binding glycan and its length correlates with the affinity of α-dystroglycan for its ligands [

25

]. The fact that ectopic expression of

LARGE1

restores the matriglycan modification in all of the RMS cell lines tested, irrespective of the internal levels of

LARGE1

, indicates that LARGE 1 restructures the binding of α-dystroglycan so that it functions as an ECM receptor in RMS. Correspondingly, in the RMS cell line Rh18, ectopic expression of LARGE1 resulted in functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan and conferred its ability to bind laminin, its natural ligand, with high-affinity.

With respect to whether defects in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan might contribute to tumor initiation versus progression, it seems more likely that it is a secondary (somatic) event involved in tumor progression. After the metastatic cancer cell has reached its secondary site, it may restore

LARGE1

expression in order to orchestrate the remodeling of the ECM in the growing secondary tumor. Although germline mutations in

LARGE1

have been reported in a group of congenital muscular dystrophies that also involve brain and eye defects, no increase in the rate of any cancer type, including RMS, has been described in patients. However, these are rare diseases and the number of patients available for such studies is limited. Similarly, higher cancer rates have not been reported in patients who carry mutations in dystrophin or α-sarcoglycan, two other components of the DGC that have been linked to RMS [

18

]. We reported that ectopic expression of

LARGE1

in these cell lines enables cells to bind laminin and reduces the invasiveness of the phenotype. Recently, two other dystroglycan-modifying glycosyltransferases, LARGE2 and B4GALNT2, were linked with the cancer-associated abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan [

14

,

15

]. Although the exact mechanisms underlying this phenotype are unknown, silencing of glycosyltransferase expression could play a role in some of these cancers. The current study is focused on establishing a proof of principle that LARGE1-driven loss of matriglycan is a common feature in rhabdomyosarcomas. Future studies will not only address the effect that matriglycan restoration may have on cell attachment and differentiation but also on in vivo invasion and metastasis.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that the modification of α-dystroglycan with matriglycan is dramatically reduced in a panel of RMS samples, and that this result is reproduced in RMS-derived cell lines. In some of the cell lines studied, the loss of matriglycan modifications could be attributed to the silencing of

LARGE1

expression. This defect was reverted by ectopic expression of

LARGE1

cDNA in all of the cell lines that were tested, which then showed normal levels of matriglycan modifications and restored the ability of α-dystroglycan to bind to laminin. Thus, ectopic expression of

LARGE1

may be worthy of further investigation as a potential therapeutic approach for RMS.

#### LARGE1 - Article 2: A novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion expanding the molecular alterations associated with the methylation class of neuroepithelial tumors with PATZ1 fusions
<Date>: 2022-2-3
<PMCID>: 8812055
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Neuroepithelial tumors (NET) with

PATZ1

fusions (NET-

PATZ1

) have been isolated by a distinct DNA methylation profile and are characterized by recurrent fusions of

PATZ1

in association with

EWSR1

or

MN1

genes [

1

]. These tumors present a wide variety of morphologies and immunophenotypes, having been initially classified as glioneuronal tumors, astroblastomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, primary neuroepithelial tumors, and round cell sarcomas, with different histopathological grades [

2

–

11

]. Because extra-CNS sarcomas may also harbor an

EWSR1-PATZ1

fusion and because of the uncertainty of the cellular origin of NET-

PATZ1

, this tumor type will not be added to the upcoming edition of the World Health Organization Classification of CNS Tumors [

12

]. Here we report a temporal tumor with a NET-

PATZ1

DNA methylation class (MC) but harboring a

LARGE1-AFF2

fusion. We compare its clinical, histopathological, immunophenotypical, genetic and epigenetic features with those previously described in NET-

PATZ1

.

Case presentation

A 3-year-old girl began experiencing seizures. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a left temporal mass with a hyperintense signal on T1-weighted images, a hypointense signal on T2-weighted-images and with a homogeneous and intense contrast enhancement after gadolinium injection (Fig.

1

A–D). The mass was cortical, well-circumscribed, solid with a small cyst, having slight perilesional edema and no leptomeningeal attachment. Neither hemorrhagic nor necrotic modification was observed and no calcifications were present on computerized tomodensitometry. Diffusion was not restricted (Fig.

1

E). Gross total resection was achieved. Microscopically, the tumor was well-delineated from the brain parenchyma (Fig.

1

F), and heterogeneous, presenting a sclerous stroma including isolated cells and nodules of glial cells with microcystic changes (F

i

g.

1

G-I). No ependymal nor astroblastic pseudorosettes, or rhabdoid component were evidenced. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells was abundant and eosinophilic. Some tumor cells were plurinucleated. No mitotic figures, nor necrosis or microvascular proliferation were observed and the MIB-1 labeling index was low (around 5%) (Fig.

1

J). Very few perivascular inflammatory infiltrates were present but no eosinophilic granular bodies or ganglion cells were observed. The tumor cells expressed glial markers (GFAP and Olig2 for a subset of cells; Fig.

1

K), MAP2 (Fig.

1

L) and NeuN (without expression of synaptophysin and chromogranin A), and CD34 (Fig.

1

M). There was no immunopositivity for CKAE1/AE3, CK18, CD99, BCOR, SOX10, IDH1R132H or Lin28A. The tumor cells focally expressed desmin but there was no immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin or myogenin (Fig.

1

N). The expression of ATRX, BRG1, INI1 and H3K27me3 was retained. Because of the fibrous stroma, a diagnosis of astroblastoma was initially suggested but a FISH analysis of the

MN1

gene failed to reveal a rearrangement. RNA sequencing (including

EWSR1, MN1

and

PATZ1

genes) evidenced a

LARGE1-AFF2

gene fusion (Fig.

2

A) and a DNA methylation analysis was conducted. The tumor was classified as NET-PATZ1 (with a strong calibrated score of 0.99) based on the DNA methylation profiling using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm as previously described (v12.3; Fig.

2

B) [

13

]. Twelve months later, the patient is well without adjuvant treatment and no residual tumor on MRI.

Discussion and conclusions

Here, we report an intracerebral tumor harboring a novel

LARGE1-AFF2

fusion, with clinical, radiological, histopathological, and epigenetic similarities to NET-

PATZ1.

Like most NET-

PATZ1

, our observation concerned a supratentorial tumor in a child (Table S1) [

1

–

8

,

11

]. Whereas neuroradiological data of this recently described tumor type is scarce, our case presented as a solid and cystic lesion with T2-weighted hypointensity suggesting fibrotic content, well-circumscribed from the brain parenchyma, as previously reported [

4

,

8

,

11

]. NET-

PATZ1

encompassed a wide variety of morphologies in the literature, including glial, glioneuronal, embryonal tumors and sarcomas (Table S1). Based on the literature review and our case, the presence of a collagenous stroma and microcysts seem to be frequent in NET-

PATZ1

(Table S1) [

1

,

4

,

8

,

11

]

.

Because of this pattern and because some of them present pseudorosettes (not seen in our case), pathologists tend to consider them a differential diagnosis for astroblastoma,

MN1

-fused [

1

,

2

,

8

]. However, NET-

PATZ1

, as with our case, exhibit frequent glioneuronal immunoprofiles and an extravascular expression of CD34 may be found, which is rare in astroblastomas (Table S1) [

1

,

11

,

14

]. The histopathological and epigenetic distinction between sarcomas with

EWSR1-PATZ1

fusion and NET,

PATZ1-

fusion positive is still not clear. Indeed, CNS and extra-CNS tumors with

PATZ1

fusion share some histopathological features (microcysts, collagenous stroma and pseudorosettes, and a mesenchymal component described in a part of NET-

PATZ1

) and a polyphenotypic immunoprofile (expression of glial, neuronal and CD34 in both) [

1

,

11

,

15

–

17

]. The DNA methylation analysis (v12.3) classified our case as a NET,

PATZ1

, although the tumor did not harbor a

PATZ1

fusion. Similarly, the case clustered with

PATZ1-

fused sarcomas, located outside the CNS on the whole RNA sequencing analysis. Our case presented a

LARGE1-AFF2

fusion which has not been previously reported in CNS or in soft tissue tumors. Whereas no

LARGE1

fusion has been described in tumors, several tumor types have been reported with

AFF2

fusions in association with different partners (

DEK

in squamous carcinomas,

RET

in lung cancer,

STAG2

in T-cell lymphoma) [

18

–

21

]. The fusion may drive the oncogenesis by deregulation of transcription as

AFF2

encodes a RNA-binding protein through the C-terminal domain that can activate transcription [

22

]. Moreover, the chimeric protein is predicted to contain the major functional domains of both LARGE1 and AFF2 proteins. Interestingly,

LARGE1

(22q12.3) and

PATZ1

(22q12.2) genes are found in close proximity on chromosome 22, and

PATZ1

was highly expressed at the RNA level (whereas

LARGE1

and

AFF2

are not) as observed in sarcomas with

PATZ1

fusion. Because DNA methylation profiles are thought to represent a combination of both somatically acquired DNA methylation changes and a signature reflecting the cell of origin [

23

], it is reasonable to assume that our case represents a subtype of NET-

PATZ1

. Because of the limited follow-up data and the heterogeneity of treatments applied in NET-

PATZ1

cases from the literature, no precise prognosis has been defined [

1

]. And despite histopathological signs of aggressivity, a probable intermediate grade has been suggested considering the better outcome associated with NET-

PATZ1

compared to high-grade tumors [

1

]. Our case is in line with these data, showing no recurrence one year after gross total resection without adjuvant treatment.

In conclusion, we expanded the defined MC NET-

PATZ1

genetic spectrum with one novel fusion that does not involve the

PATZ1

gene. This case illustrates that further studies are needed to characterize in detail this rare type of tumor in terms of cellular origin, histopathology, genetic features and outcome.

#### LARGE1 - Article 3: High LARGE1 Expression May Predict Benefit from Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Resected Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
<Date>: 2021-1-18
<PMCID>: 7822230
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

1

In 2020, it is expected that there will be 228,820 cases of lung cancer and 135,720 related deaths in the United States.

1

There are two main histological types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

2

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases and can further be divided into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).

2

The 5-year survival rate of all patients with lung cancer is only about 19%.

1

,

3

Surgical resection is the main and most effective choice for NSCLC patients, but only 20% of patients are suitable for surgery due to late diagnosis

4

and postoperative tumor recurrence is the major cause of treatment failure.

5–7

Platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy is one of the main means to improve the overall survival (OS) of patients with NSCLC after surgical resection, especially for patients with advanced tumors

8

after several previous randomized clinical trials demonstrated ACT is associated with statistically significant survival advantages in patients with completely resected NSCLC.

9–13

However, a meta-analysis of these studies suggested that ACT only provides an absolute benefit of 5.4% in 5-year OS

14

due to primary and acquired drug resistance.

15

And the remaining 85%–95% of patients do not get benefit from ACT but suffer the ACT toxicity. Thus, it is critical to identify NSCLC patients who will not benefit from ACT.

LARGE1

, encoding a bifunctional glycosyltransferase, participates in glycosylation of α-DG by synthesizing and transferring the laminin-binding repeating units of 3GlcA-1-3Xyl-1 onto α-DG.

16

LARGE1 downregulation has been found to underlie abnormal glycosylation of α-DG in epithelium-derived cancer cells lines derived from breast, cervical, and lung cancers and exogenous expression of LARGE1 restores normal glycosylation and laminin binding of α-DG, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and reduced cell migration in vitro.

17

Exogenous expression of LARGE1 has also been found to restore α-DG matriglycan and laminin binding in rhabdomyosarcoma.

18

Currently, the clinical significance of LARGE1 in lung cancer is not clear. In the present study, we utilized the large dataset of NSCLC patients from TCGA database to investigate the expression of LARGE1 and its clinical significance and further validated the results in external cohorts. In addition, we preliminarily explored the potential molecular mechanisms related to LARGE1 in NSCLC carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods

Expression of LARGE1 mRNA Expression in NSCLC

TCGA TARGET GTEx dataset, which contains gene expression data in tumor tissues, adjacent tissues, and normal lung tissues, was downloaded from Xenabrowser.net

19

and used to investigate LARGE1 mRNA expression in NSCLC tumor tissues, adjacent tissues, and normal lung tissues.

Kaplan–Meier Plotter

Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM plotter),

20

a web-based tool, is capable of assessing the effect of 54k genes (mRNA, miRNA, protein) on survival in 21 cancer types with the data from the databases including GEO, EGA, and TCGA. This tool consisted of 2,437 lung cancer cases with gene profile (mRNA) data determined by microarray. Of the 2,437 lung cases, 1,927 cases had OS information. We used the tool to initially analyze the association of LARGE1 expression with OS in lung cancer with Auto select best cutoff value and the JetSet best probe set (215543_s_at) for LARGE1.

Analysis of NSCLC Data from TCGA

To further investigate the associations of LARGE1 mRNA levels with clinicopathological features and OS in NSCLC, RNA-Seq data and corresponding clinical data of the NSCLC patients were downloaded from TCGA database by Xenabrowser.net.

19

The correlations between LARGE1 expression and baseline clinical characteristics in NSCLC patients were examined by the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier plot curves were used to explore the association of LARGE1 expression (optimal cutoff value) with OS in overall NSCLC patients. Univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were also used to explore the effects of LARGE1 mRNA levels on OS in overall and subgroups stratified by age, gender, smoking history, tumor stage, margin status, and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) treatment. Furthermore, LARGE1 expression and ACT were also combined to classify NSCLC patients to observe their OS difference in Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Validation

To validate the results from the TCGA cohort, external cohort studies were searched in NCBI GEO database. The datasets in which: 1) the subjects were resected NSCLC patients; (2) the patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and without chemotherapy; and 3) contained follow-up information (OS time and status) and contained LARGE1 expression levels analyzed by microarray or high throughput sequencing were downloaded. Only TNM stage I–III patients were enrolled. The datasets GSE42127,

21

GSE14814,

22

and GSE68465

23

were included (

Tables S1

and

S2

).

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To investigate the potential molecular mechanisms during LARGE1 alteration in lung cancer, the Spearman correlations analysis results of more than 20,000 genes with LARGE1 in lung adenocarcinoma in the TCGA database were downloaded via cBioPortal (cbiopartal.org).

24

,

25

The genes were ranked by the Spearman’s rank r and subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) via software, JAVA GSEA 3.0 (

http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp

).

26

,

27

The biologically defined gene sets “c2.cp.kegg.v7.1.symbols.gmt,” “c7.all.v7.1.symbols.gmt,” and “h.all.v7.1.symbols.gmt” were used as the reference databases.

Association of LARGE mRNA Expression with Cell Cycle Pathway Score

Akbani et al have used reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from TCGA to calculate the score for 10 cancer-related pathways in 32 cancer types including cell cycle pathway.

28

RPPA is a high-throughput antibody-based technique with procedures similar to that of Western blots. The pathway score is then the sum of the relative protein level of all positive regulatory components minus that of negative regulatory components in a particular pathway. For the cell cycle pathway, its score is the sum of the relative protein levels of CDK1, CYCLINB1, CYCLIND1, CYCLINDE1, CYCLINE2, P27PT157, P27PT198, and PCNA. Association of LARGE1 expression with cell cycle pathway score in lung adenocarcinoma was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare LARGE1 expression in NSCLC tumor tissues, adjacent tissues, and normal lung tissues and in patients with different stages. Fisher’s exact test or Chi-square test were used to determine the associations of LARGE1 expression with clinical features of NSCLC patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models as well as Kaplan-Meier curves adjusted by confounding factors and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to clarify the effects of LARGE1 expression on OS in NSCLC patients. All statistical analyses were performed with R software (v 3.4.3). A two-sided

P

< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

LARGE1 Was Downregulated in NSCLC

TCGA TARGET GTEx dataset was used to investigate LARGE1 mRNA expression in NSCLC tumor tissues, adjacent tissues, and normal lung tissues. LARGE1 was found to be downregulated in LUAD tumor tissues (

Figure 1A

) and LUSC tumor tissues (

Figure 1B

) compared with corresponding adjacent tissues and normal lung tissues. In addition, LARGE1 expression was determined in tumors with different stages in patients with TNM I–III NSCLC. The results suggested that LARGE1 was decreasingly expressed along with advancing tumor T stage (

Figure 1C

and

D

), N stage (

Figure 1E

and

F

), and TNM stage (

Figure 1G

and

H

) in both LUAD (

Correlations of LARGE1 Expression with Clinicopathological Features in Stage I-III NSCLC Patients

A total of 981 NSCLC patients from the TCGA database with baseline clinical characteristics and OS outcome information were split into a high LARGE1 expression group and a low LARGE1 expression group by the median value of LARGE1 expression. As shown in

Table 1

, high LARGE1 was associated with advanced T stage, N stage, TNM stage, LUSC, and older age but not with gender and smoking history.

Correlations of LARGE1 Expression Levels with Overall Survival in Stage I-III NSCLC Patients

Effects of LARGE1 expression levels on OS in NSCLC was first examined using Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM plotter) and high LARGE1 expression was found to be associated with favorable OS in 1,925 NSCLC patients (

Figure 2A

). Then the effect of LARGE1 expression on OS was investigated in the 981 NSCLC patients from TCGA. Increased LARGE1 expression was associated with favorable OS in NSCLC revealed by both Kaplan-Meier curve with Log rank test (optimal cutoff value,

P

=0.028;

Figure 2B

) and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model (HR=0.797; 95% CI=0.651–0.976;

P

=0.029). However, the association was not significant in the multivariate model (HR=0.806, 95% CI=0.633–1.027,

P

=0.081). Next, we used LARGE1 expression level as a continuous variable to explore its effects on OS in different subgroups stratified by age, gender, smoking history, histology, TNM stage, margin, adjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant radiotherapy. Association of increasing LARGE1 expression with OS was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy but not in other subgroups (

Figure 2C

). After splitting LARGE1 expression into high and low groups, similar results were obtained by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses (

Figure 3A–C

;

Table 2

). And ACT was found to provide more benefit in the high LARGE1 group compared to the low LARGE1 group (

Figure 3D

and

E

, and

Table 2

). We also found a significant interaction between LARGE1 expression and adjuvant chemotherapy when evaluating their effects on OS (

Table 2

). Furthermore, we classified the patients by combining LARGE1 expression and adjuvant chemotherapy into three groups, ie, non-ACT, low LARGE1/ACT, and high LARGE1/ACT. Compared with patients with non-ACT, HR of low LARGE1/ACT was 0.592 (95% CI=0.432–0.813,

P

=0.0012), and HR of high LARGE1/ACT was 0.124 (95% CI=0.031–0.505,

=0.0036) (

Validation

The above results suggested high LARGE1 expression might help to identify the patients who would get more benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I–III NSCLC, so next we validated the results in external cohorts from the GEO database. Datasets GSE42127, GSE14814, GSE29013, and GSE68465 contained resected NSCLC cases treated with ACT or not and provided OS information (

Table S1

). ACT was found to improve OS in datasets GSE42127 and GSE14814 while decrease OS in datasets GSE29013 and GSE68465, thus validation was only performed in datasets GSE42127 and GSE14814 (

Table S2

). Similar to the results from the TCGA cohort, in both GSE42127 and GSE14814 cohorts, LARGE1 expression was associated with OS in patients with ACT while not in patients without ACT, and ACT was associated with OS in patients with high LARGE1 expression while not in patients with low LARGE1 expression (

Figures S1

and

S2

;

Table 2

). The whole cohort of patients was also classified into three groups based on LARGE1 expression and ACT as well as TCGA cohort, compared to patients with non-ACT and those with LARGE1/ACT, patients with high LARGE1/ACT were found to be associated with significantly improved OS (

Figures S3

and

S4

;

Table 2

).

Potential Mechanisms During LARGE1 Alteration in Lung Adenocarcinoma

To elucidate the potential mechanisms during LARGE1 alteration in lung cancer, the Spearman correlations analysis results of more than 20,000 genes with LARGE1 in lung adenocarcinoma were download from TCGA. The genes were ranked by the Spearman’s rank r and subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). KEGG pathways, GO biological processes, and hallmarks that were positively or negatively correlated with LARGE1 expression were explored.

Figure 5

showed the top 10 negative- and top 10 positive-associated gene sets against KEGG (

Figure 5A

), HALLMARK (

Figure 5B

), and GO biological processes (

Figure 5C

) databases, respectively. KEGG Cell cycle pathway (

Figure 6A

), HALLMARK G2/M checkpoint (

Figure 6B

), and GO cell cycle G2/M phase transition (

Figure 6C

) were all negatively associated with LARGE1 expression, indicating LARGE1 might improve patients’ outcomes via partly downregulating cell cycle in lung adenocarcinoma. The result was further validated by examining the association of LARGE1 expression with cell cycle pathway score, which was calculated by summing cell cycle-related proteins expression (

Figure 6D

).

LARGE1 is important for α-DG glycosylation by adding the laminin-binding repeating units of 3GlcA-1-3Xyl-1 onto α-DG

16

and significant association of LARGE1 downregulation with abnormal α-DG glycosylation in cancer cells has been observed.

17

,

18

In the present study, we, for the first time, have reported that LARGE1 mRNA expression was downregulated in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues and normal lung tissues and in patients with advanced stages compared with early stages via analyzing the large dataset from the TCGA database. And there was a trend of significant association between LARGE1 downregulation with poor overall survival in stage I–III patients in overall and LARGE1 downregulation was significantly associated with poor overall survival in stage I–III patients receiving ACT.

ACT is the standard care for patients with NSCLC after complete resection, unfortunately, only a few of the patients get to benefit from ACT due to primary and acquired drug resistance.

14

,

15

Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive biomarkers to identify the patients who will benefit from ACT and who will not benefit from ACT to avoid unnecessary toxicity and the delay of further treatment. Previously, low expression of ERCC1

52

and high expression of TUBB3

53

were shown to be predictive of benefit from ACT in NSCLC patients from a large cohort or clinical trial. However, large cross-validation studies suggested that attempts to validate ERCC1 or TUBB3 as predictive biomarkers fell short.

54

,

55

Similar results were derived for validating other single biomarkers including p53, RRM1, and p27.

56–58

Here, we found high LARGE1 mRNA expression can be used to identify the patients who would benefit from ACT, which was also validated in external cohorts, although this should be validated in more and larger multi-center studies.

LARGE1 is essential for α-DG glycosylation, which mediates the interaction between cells and the ECM and may play critical roles in the development and progression of many cancers by modulating cell growth, differentiation, shape change, and movement.

36

,

37

,

59

In our study, we performed GSEA and found cell cycle regulation during LARGE1 alteration might be involved in carcinogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma, which might also be associated with ACT sensitivity. The potential mechanisms of LARGE1 downregulation in lung cancer were also unknown. Zhang et al reported that reduced LARGE1 expression was associated with its promoter hypermethylation in tongue cancer.

46

In lung cancer, we also identified the negative and significant association between LARGE1 mRNA expression and the methylation of the CpG islands at its promoter (data not shown). More in vitro and animal experiments should be performed to validate our results.

Conclusions

LARGE1 mRNA expression was aberrantly downregulated in NSCLC and especially in cancers with advanced stages. High LARGE1 mRNA expression was associated with favorable OS in NSLCLC patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy rather than in patients without ACT and improved OS after ACT was also found in patients with high LARGE1 than those with low LARGE1. External cohorts confirmed these results, indicating that high LARGE expression could be used to identify the NSCLC patients who benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy.

#### LARGE1 - Article 4: Structural basis for matriglycan synthesis by the LARGE1 dual glycosyltransferase
<Date>: 2022-12-13
<PMCID>: 9746966
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (LARGE1) is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase (GTase) [

1

] that plays a critical role in maintaining proper muscle function [

2

]. This enzyme is responsible for a post-translational modification on the extracellular matrix receptor, α-dystroglycan (α-DG), which enables it to interact with proteins containing a laminin-G domain [

1

,

2

]. This carbohydrate addition to α-DG is critical for the communication between the F-actin cytoskeleton network and the basal lamina [

3

,

4

]. The polysaccharide which LARGE1 synthesizes, termed matriglycan, is composed of xylose (Xyl) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) subunits in a linear repeating structure of [-3GlcA-β1,3-Xyl-α1-]

n

[

5

,

6

]. Matriglycan presents multiple binding sites for interacting with laminin G (LG)-like domains, leading to both high avidity and specificity. Binding between the LG-domain and matriglycan is facilitated by the chelation of a Ca

2+

ion bound to the hydroxyl groups of the GlcA & Xyl subunits [

7

].

Matriglycan is thought to be a unique modification of α-DG [

5

] and the initiation of its synthesis depends on a complex network of at least 16 other enzymes [

8

–

11

]. Initiation of matriglycan synthesis is dependent on Protein O-Mannose Kinase (POMK) phosphorylation of the mannose of a core M3 O-glycan, GalNAcβ(1,3)-GlcNAcβ(1,4)-Man-O-Thr [

10

,

12

,

13

]. Further studies showed that the M3 glycan is elongated with ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) [

14

–

16

], after which the priming enzymes, RXYLT1 [

17

] and B4GAT1 [

18

,

19

], add GlcAβ(1–4)Xyl, which can then be recognized by LARGE1 [

20

]. The length of α-DG-conjugated matriglycan chains varies substantially and is highly dependent on the tissue where it is produced [

4

,

5

]. Chain elongation of matriglycan is terminated by 3-O-sulfation on a GlcA subunit by the sulfotransferase, HNK-1ST [

21

].

Mutations in the genes responsible for the synthesis of these glycan precursors can result in hypoglycosylation of α-DG and disease-causing phenotypes [

22

]. Improper glycosylation of α-DG is responsible for various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), collectively termed dystroglycanopathies, which yield skeletal, brain, and eye abnormalities [

23

,

24

]. Mutations specifically within the

LARGE1

gene can cause severe forms of secondary dystroglycanopathies [

25

,

26

]. Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is considered to be the most serious form of dystroglycanopathies and is characterized by significant brain abnormalities, inability to develop significant motor function, and typically death within infancy [

23

,

24

]. Several point mutations within LARGE1 have been known to result in life-threatening phenotypes [

24

,

26

–

28

].

LARGE1

deficiency is also believed to be an underlying cause of epithelium-derived [

29

] & lung [

30

] cancers.

LARGE1 is present in the Golgi [

31

] as a type II membrane protein, composed of a transmembrane/cytosolic region, a predicted coiled-coil/stem (CC), and domains with xylosyltransferase (Xyl-T) and glucuronyltransferase (GlcA-T) catalytic activities, which are separated by a linker [

1

,

32

] (

Fig 1a

). Most of the currently available structural data for GTases were derived using X-ray crystallography. However, the organization of the GTases solved within a crystal lattice could make it difficult to determine their true native oligomeric states. Structural data on bifunctional GTases, like LARGE1, is scarce [

33

–

36

]. While the presence of the CC domain in LARGE1 suggests that it forms higher-order oligomers, it is unknown how LARGE1 would oligomerize. Additionally, how the two domains orchestrate alternating synthesis of this polysaccharide is unclear. GTases have frequently been observed as homo-oligomers and the oligomeric state can be required for the enzymatic function [

37

–

40

]. It was previously suggested that the transmembrane/stem region of a GTase is critical for their oligomerization [

41

,

42

] but it is still unclear as to which other factors facilitate oligomer formation.

The fraction of counts is noted for the two main peaks in the data sets that corresponds to the monomeric (~80 kDa) and dimeric (~160 kDa) forms of LARGE1. The rest of the counts (6% and 5%, for with and without CC, respectively) do not belong to these two main peaks. These are representative measurements that were repeated multiple times using different protein batches. (d) 2D class averages of LARGE1 particles from the two forms. For each LARGE1 form, two separate classes are shown, representing two distinct and perpendicular views. The 2-fold symmetry axes are shown as dashed yellow lines (for in-plane axes) or as an oval shape (for out-of-plane axis). Same-type domains are marked with asterisks.

Here, we investigated the structure of LARGE1 using a combination of X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We found that in solution, the catalytic domains of LARGE1 can dimerize in two distinct configurations. We further show that the CC domain promotes dimerization and further selects one of these configurations, which places the active sites of one Xyl-T and one GlcA-T in close proximity that may promote efficient synthesis of matriglycan.

Results

The ectodomain of LARGE1 forms a dimer in solution

To characterize LARGE1, we produced in HEK293F cells two soluble, affinity-tagged, secreted forms of this protein. Both forms include the entire catalytic ectodomain module without the transmembrane part of the protein, but one contains the CC domain, and the other does not (will be referred to as LARGE1

ecto

, and LARGE1

ΔCC

, respectively). Both forms were readily expressed and were easily captured from cells’ media using Ni

2

+ affinity chromatography. Subsequent purification of these two proteins using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) resulted in nearly-homogenous protein samples (

Fig 1b

). For both protein samples, the SEC elution profiles were similar, with a single main peak that contained the LARGE1 protein (

Fig 1b

). Analyzing both protein samples using mass photometry at a concentration of 30 nM (2.5 μg/ml) indicated the existence of a monomer/dimer equilibrium (

Fig 1c

). At this concentration, LARGE1

ecto

had a higher propensity to form a dimer compared with LARGE1

ΔCC

(

Fig 1c

). The CC-mediated higher propensity for dimer formation suggests that this region is indeed forming a coiled-coil as was previously predicted [

32

]. Noteworthy, this analysis indicates that even in the absence of the CC domain, the catalytic module of LARGE1 is sufficient to mediate dimerization.

While both LARGE1 constructs dimerize in solution, single-particle cryo-EM analysis indicated that they do so in two different configurations: 2D class averages indicate that in the presence of the CC domain, the dimer forms with a parallel orientation in which each of the two catalytic domains (

Fig 1a

) interacts with the same domain of the second protomer (

Fig 1d

). In contrast, LARGE1

ΔCC

forms an anti-parallel dimer in which each of the catalytic domains interacts with the other domain of the second protomer (

Fig 1d

). Therefore, the ectodomain of LARGE1 has an inherent propensity to dimerize and the presence of the CC domain favors a parallel orientation for dimer formation.

The dimeric structure of LARGE1

Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the two LARGE1 constructs yielded interpretable density maps (

Fig 2

). Both dimers exhibit a clear 2-fold symmetry, which was applied during reconstruction. The LARGE1

ecto

and LARGE1

ΔCC

dimers provided density maps extending to gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) resolution values of 3.9 Å, and 3.7 Å, respectively. While obtaining the single-particle EM data, we also managed to crystallize the LARGE1

ΔCC

and to collect X-ray diffraction data, extending to 2.6 Å (

Table 1

). We, therefore, utilized one-half of the EM density map (

Fig 2

) as a search model in Phaser [

43

] to obtain phases for the X-ray diffraction data, following a previously described method [

44

]. The crystal of LARGE1 belonged to a

C

2 space group, and we found two copies of LARGE1 in the asymmetric unit. We used Phenix-Autobuild [

45

] to provide an initial model and then manually completed the model using an iterative model building and refinement in Coot [

46

] and Phenix-Refine [

47

], respectively.

The crystal structure of LARGE1 consists of two chains that make a dimer in the asymmetric unit (

Fig 3a

). For both chains (i.e., A and B), electron density was visible and hence allowed us to model residues 134 to 752. The electron density for some loops was either poor or was lacking completely and hence the model lacks residues: 282–286, 362–367, 369–372, 382–391, 626–636, 718–719 for chain A, and 280–286, 361–367, 370–372, 383–391, 713–718 for chain B. The two chains adopt an almost identical configuration with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 1.4 Å for all shared Cα atoms (

Fig 3a

). Despite the fact that we have crystallized the LARGE1

ΔCC

construct, the two chains in the asymmetric unit formed a parallel dimer that resembles the EM map of the LARGE1

ecto

. Indeed, the crystallographic dimer readily fits into the EM density map of the LARGE1

ecto

(

Fig 3b

). Noteworthy, the crystal packing is such that two neighboring LARGE1 dimers have their N-termini facing each other in a way that does not leave enough room for accommodating two CC domains. Hence, LARGE1

ecto

will not be able to crystallize with a similar crystal packing. In order to fit into the EM map of the LARGE1

ΔCC

, the chains need to be rotated in respect to one another to form an anti-parallel dimer (

Fig 3c

). Considering the high similarity of chains, A and B of the crystallographic model (

Fig 3a

) and since a rotation of the LARGE1 monomers is sufficient to get a good fit into the EM map of the LARGE1

ΔCC

, it indicates that the relative orientation of the Xyl-T domain in respect to the GlcA-T domain is maintained in all of these states. In addition, the fact that the LARGE1

ΔCC

crystallized in the parallel dimeric form as observed for the LARGE1

ecto

(

Fig 3b

) implies that it also forms such parallel dimers in solution despite the fact that the EM analysis only revealed anti-parallel dimers (Figs

1d

,

2

and

3c

). Hence, in equilibrium, and in the absence of the CC domain, the anti-parallel dimeric form is energetically preferred and thus dominates. The parallel dimers do exist, but at a lower abundance that is not apparent in our EM data. Likely due to packing considerations, these low-abundant parallel dimers were the ones that first nucleated and subsequently dictated the organization of the LARGE1 crystals. Noteworthy, the LARGE1 molecules that were incorporated into the solid crystal phase are no longer at equilibrium with the soluble LARGE1 molecules, which according to Le Chatelier’s principle, shifts the equilibrium toward the formation of this parallel dimer form.

(e) Detailed view of the Xyl-T/XylT interface that makes the buried patch. (f) Detailed view of the GlcA-T/GlcA-T interface that makes the buried patch.

The selection of the parallel dimeric form by the presence of the CC domain (Figs

1d

and

3b

) indicates that this may be the preferred physiological dimer

in-vivo

. We hence focus our analysis on this dimeric form. Inspection of the parallel dimer interface shows an overall buried surface area of 2,589 Å

2

(1,350 Å

2

on chain ‘A’ and 1239 Å

2

on chain ‘B’) (

Fig 3d

). However, if we consider additional residues at the interface, which make very narrow cavities (i.e., using a probe with a radius of 2.0 Å for detecting buried surfaces), the buried surface area then becomes 4,443 Å

2

. This buried surface area spans the Xyl-T and GlcA-T catalytic domains as well as some residues at the linker region between the domains (

Fig 3d

). In this dimer form, more surface is buried at the interface of the two Xyl-T domains than between the GlcA-T domains, and in both cases, most of the buried residues make continuous patches (

Fig 3d

). Examining the surface electrostatic potential shows that the dimer interface is mostly uncharged (

Fig 3d

). Various residues contribute to the buried, hydrophobic patches on the Xyl-T (

Fig 3e

) and on the GlcA-T (

Fig 3f

) domains. Besides the hydrophobic patches, polar residues exist at various locations along the dimeric interface. These residues may participate in water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks that may also contribute for dimerization. Having fairly flat hydrophobic surfaces on both catalytic domains may help to rationalize the ability of LARGE1 to form an anti-parallel dimer when the CC domain is not dictating a parallel configuration.

The Xyl-T and GlcA-T catalytic domains

The Xyl-T domain of LARGE1, which is classified by the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (

http://www.cazy.org/

) as a GT family 8 retaining transferase [

48

], adopts a canonical GT-A fold. This fold is composed of 7-stranded major & 3-stranded minor β-sheets, encompassed by α-helices (

Fig 4a

). In its active site, the Xyl-T domain presents a conserved DXD motif (Asp242-X-Asp244) (

Fig 4a

), which is a motif that mediates binding of nucleoside-bound sugars through a manganese ion and is important for the activity of GTases from many distinct enzyme families [

49

]. Structures of other xylosyltransferases have been solved. Comparing the Xyl-T domain with the structure of a mouse-derived xyloside α-1,3-xylosyltransferase (XXYLT1) [

50

], which is an enzyme unrelated to LARGE1, reveals a similar general architecture (

Fig 4a

). In the active site of the Xyl-T domain, we could not detect a clear density that would indicate the presence of a divalent cation. Nevertheless, the superimposition of these two structures places the XXYLT1-derived Mn

2+

such that it would be coordinated by the DXD-residues Asp242 and Asp244, and by His380 of LARGE1 (

Fig 4a

). These three residues are conserved in XXYLT1 as well as in other xylosyltransferases [

50

,

51

]. The Mn

2+

helps to position the UDP-xylose in the active site [

50

]. Based on the XXYLT1 structure, we can postulate the position of the UDP-sugar donor in the active site of the LARGE1 Xyl-T (

Fig 4a and 4b

). Gln335 of LARGE1 is also a conserved residue (

Fig 4a

), and based on the enzymatic mechanism of XXYLT1 [

50

], it likely binds the substrate and also functions in stabilizing high-energy intermediate states, making it a critical residue for catalysis. Overall, the superimposition with XXYLT1 elucidates how the UDP-xylose and growing substrates would fit into the catalytic site of the LARGE1 Xyl-T (

Fig 4b

).

are noted, as well as a UDP and a growing substrate that were resolved in the structure of XXYLT1. (b) Surface representation of the LARGE1 Xyl-T domain. The aspartic acids of the DXD motif are colored yellow. The UDP and the growing substrate derived from the structure of XXYLT1 are shown as sticks.

The GlcA-T domain of LARGE1 also adopts a canonical GT-A fold and has a conserved DXD motif (Asp563-X-Asp565) (

Fig 5a

). It is classified by the CAZy database as a GT family 49 inverting transferase [

48

]. The closest structural homolog of the LARGE1 GlcA-T according to 3D-BLAST [

52

] is the chondroitin polymerase from K4

E

.

coli

(K4CP) (PDB:2z86) [

53

]. Similar to LARGE1, K4CP is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of GlcA and

N

-acetylgalactosamine to the chondroitin polymer [

53

], but unlike GlcA-T, it belongs to GT family 2 according to the CAZy database [

48

]. In the electron density map, we observed density for a coordinated ion in the active site of the GlcA-T domain (

Fig 5b

) and we therefore modeled a Mn

2+

atom, which is an essential metal for the activity of LARGE1 [

54

]. Compared with K4CP, the Mn

2+

atoms in the GlcA-T domain are slightly shifted away from the coordinating aspartic acids and histidine residues (

Fig 5a

, inset). The exact position of Mn

2+

may change when UDP-GlcA is bound in the active site as this shifted location seems to collide with the UDP as seen in the K4CP structure. The LARGE1 GlcA-T domain has an extra histidine (His708) that seems to participate in the binding of the Mn

2+

. This histidine residue is not conserved in K4CP which has a proline (Pro389) instead (

Fig 5a

, inset). As in the Xyl-T domain, the Mn

2+

in the GlcA-T domain is important for holding the UDP-sugar donor in place. A surface representation of the GlcA-T domain reveals the approximate location of UDP in the active site (

Fig 5c

). The K4CP-derived UDP fits into a deep pocket, leaving a narrow tunnel for the growing matriglycan substrate to enter (

Fig 5c

).

atoms of LARGE1 (purple) and of K4CP (green) are shown as semi-transparent spheres. A UDP from the K4CP structure is shown in purple. The conserved DXD motif and histidine residues that participate in the coordination of the Mn

atoms. (c) Surface representation of the LARGE1 GlcA-T domain. The aspartic acids of the DXD motif are colored yellow. The UDP derived from the structure of K4CP is shown as sticks.

Matriglycan synthesis by the dimeric LARGE1

The matriglycan polymer that LARGE1 synthesizes is made of alternating Xyl and GlcA monomers. Hence, the growing matriglycan chain needs to enter into the active sites of the Xyl-T and the GlcA-T domains in an alternating manner. Interestingly, the closest Xyl-T and GlcA-T sites in the context of the LARGE1 dimer are located on opposite monomers rather than on a single protomer (

Fig 6

). These two sites are approximately 40 Å away from each other and make the shortest possible path for a matriglycan non-reducing end to encounter the two different transferases. The alternative path between the two catalytic sites of a single protomer, requires the matriglycan chain to travel around the dimer to reach its far side. Hence the most diffusion-efficient synthesis of matriglycan will make use of the Xyl-T and the GlcA-T domains of separate monomers in the context of the dimer.

The closest active sites of the Xyl-T and GlcA-T domains are located of different monomers. The LARGE1 dimer is shown using a surface representation and the catalytic domains are colored as in

Fig 3a

. The two LARGE1 monomers are highlighted by different tones. A yellow arrow shows the openings of the closest Xyl-T and GlcA-T catalytic sites.

Disease-causing mutations in LARGE1

Several alterations in LARGE1 were previously identified as disease-causing mutations. Such mutations include: S331F [

27

], C443Y [

24

], W495R [

28

], and E509K [

26

]. Having the structural information for LARGE1 allows us to gain some insights for the possible molecular mechanisms that underly the deleterious effect of these mutations. Ser331 is a surface-exposed residue in the Xyl-T catalytic domain (

Fig 7a

). Introducing phenylalanine in this position does not have an obvious consequence on the structure of LARGE1. Nevertheless, Ser331 is located at the vicinity of some surface-exposed hydrophobic residues like Trp276 and Leu332 (

Fig 7a

). Potentially, introducing a S331F mutation may form a hydrophobic patch that would drive aggregation of LARGE1. Cys443 is located within the linker between the Xyl-T and GlcA-T domains (

Fig 7a

). It makes a disulfide bond with a cysteine residue in the GlcA-T domain (

Fig 7a

). A tyrosine residue instead of a cysteine in position 443 will abrogate the disulfide bridge and will likely also prevent proper folding due to steric clashes with its bulky side chain. Trp495 is located in the GlcA-T domain and is making an integral part of the hydrophobic core (

Fig 7a

). A positively-charged arginine facing straight into the hydrophobic core of the protein is likely to be highly destabilizing for the folded state of the protein, which will effectively prevent its proper folding. Glu509 is located within the dimer interface of the GlcA-T domains near its 2-fold symmetry axis (

Fig 7a

). Glu509 is making long-range electrostatic interactions with the nearby Lys536 (

Fig 7a

), which likely balance the overall surface electrostatic potential at this position. Mutating Glu509 to a lysine will likely cause the accumulation of a local positive surface electrostatic potential, which will make dimer formation to be less favorable.

(b) Western blot analysis using anti-His antibody showing the expression of soluble LARGE1-His WT or E509K mutant. Samples include the total cell lysates and cells’ media as indicated. (c) Similar to ‘b’, a western blot analysis showing the cells’ media and lysates from cell transfected with LARGE1-WT, -S331F, -C443Y, or -W495R. Lysate from non-transfected cells is shown as a negative control (NC).

From the abovementioned structural analysis, it seems like the underlying molecular mechanisms of these four mutations involve the disruption of the global structure of LARGE1 rather than a direct interference at the catalytic sites. Indeed, after individually incorporating each of the four point mutations on the secreted form of LARGE1

ecto

, we could no longer detect secreted LARGE1 in the cells’ media (

Fig 7b & 7c

). Interestingly, all of these mutated LARGE1 variants do express in the cells as could be seen in the total cell lysates (

Fig 7b & 7c

). Hence, these proteins are produced but fail to secrete from the cells. This failure in secretion is likely due to the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum [

55

], which supports the notion of a global effect of these mutations on the stability of LARGE1. Interestingly, the clinical manifestations of these mutations are not identical [

24

,

26

–

28

]. Hence, while the biochemical end result seems to be the same for all of these mutations, subtle changes do exist, which warrant further investigations.

Discussion

LARGE1 has a high propensity to form dimers. Mass-photometry measurements at a LARGE1 concentration of 30 nM indicated the presence of significant amounts of both the monomer and of the dimer forms in equilibrium (

Fig 1c

). At higher concentrations, as were used for preparing the EM grids for example (

i

.

e

., ~4 μM), the predominant form was already dimeric as no 2D class averages were obtained for a monomeric LARGE1. It is also clear that the CC domain promotes dimerization of LARGE1 (

Fig 1c

) and further selects a parallel organization for the dimer (Figs

1d

,

2

&

3b

). Taken together, under physiological conditions, in cells, LARGE1 is likely in the form of a parallel dimer, but future

in-vivo

studies will need to corroborate this notion. Interestingly, this parallel dimer form of LARGE1 includes homo-association of the Xyl-T and the GlcA-T domains (

Fig 3a

).

Homo-association of other Xyl-Ts and GlcA-Ts, which are not related to LARGE1, has been previously observed [

38

,

50

,

56

–

59

]. Additionally, homo-association has been shown to be important for the enzymatic activity of some GTases. For example, the generation of a monomeric form of human lysyl hydrolase 3 (LH3), which is a multifunctional GTase, results in deterioration of enzymatic activity [

60

]. Destabilization of the homodimeric interface area by disease causing mutations in O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) was found to decrease its catalytic activity [

61

]. Additionally, disruption of homodimerization for the dual glycosyltransferase 1 (dGT1) also lead to a significantly decrease in its GlcNAc-T activity [

36

]. As postulated below, the association of LARGE1 into a dimer may also be important for its catalytic activity.

The assembly of LARGE1 into a dimer brings into a close proximity the active sites of Xyl-T and GlcA-T from opposite monomers (

Fig 6

). This proximity between the two active sites increases the probability that the growing matriglycan chain will be sequentially modified by the two domains before the matriglycan polymer dissociates from LARGE1. While preparing this manuscript for submission, a complementary investigation of LARGE1 was deposited in a preprint server [

62

]. This work also supports the notion that active sites from two opposite chains contribute for the synthesis of matriglycan, which likely represent the most efficient way that LARGE1 can generate matriglycan.

Interestingly, the matriglycan product can potentially consist of hundreds of repeating Xyl-GlcA units [

5

]. Since HNK-1ST terminates matriglycan synthesis [

21

], the production of long matriglycan chains suggests that encounters of HNK1-ST with the growing matriglycan are not frequent, and perhaps even restricted, during the elongation process. Delaying capping of matriglycan could potentially be achieved if the growing matriglycan chain will not be completely released from LARGE1 after the addition of each sugar monomer. Due to the high content of GlcA, matriglycan has a negative charge. Examining the surface electrostatic potential of the LARGE1 dimer, we see a positively-charged patch at the interface of the two GlcA-T domains and a significantly larger positively-charged surface formed at the interface of the Xyl-T domains (

Fig 8

). We therefore speculate that unspecific electrostatic interactions may form between these positively-charged surfaces of LARGE1 and matriglycan, which may delay the release of the polymer during synthesis. By that, the effective local concentration of matriglycan will increase, which will promote synthesis of long matriglycan chains.

Several point mutations within the

LARGE1

gene were linked to pathological conditions. The E509K missense mutation, for instance, results in a significant loss of matriglycan generation, along with α-DG:laminin binding, and thus causes a serious form of α-dystroglycanopathy, termed MDC1D [

26

,

63

]. The E509K LARGE1 mutant was shown to localize in the ER and does not progress to the Golgi [

63

]. Our observations corroborate this notion as the soluble His-tagged LARGE1

ecto

that carries the E509K mutation is also produced in cells but is not secreted (

Fig 7b

), indicating a failure to progress in the secretory pathways. Our structural analysis suggests that the E509K mutation may abrogate dimerization of LARGE1 by localizing positive charge at the symmetry axis of the dimer interface, which will disfavor dimerization due to electrostatic repulsion (

Fig 7a

). Dimerization of LARGE1 seems to be required for progressing through the ER/Golgi network. Interestingly, oligomerization has been shown to be a prerequisite for Golgi translocation for other membrane-bound proteins. The GTases, EXT1 & EXT2 that function as a heterodimer for example, are retained in the ER when expressed alone. Only upon co-expression of both of these GTases can the heterodimer form and reach the Golgi [

64

,

65

]. Other membrane proteins, such as prenylin, are believed to require homodimerization to enter the Golgi [

66

], and a failure to multimerize retains various other proteins in the ER [

67

–

70

]. Taken together, we propose that dimerization of LARGE1 is essential for its proper function in cells.

Overall, we have deciphered the structure of the LARGE1 bi-functional glycosyltransferase. Dictated by the CC/stem domain, a parallel dimer of LARGE1 is formed and is required for proper localization in the cells. Dimerization enables advantageous properties for LARGE1 that likely contribute to its ability to synthesize long chains of matriglycan.

Materials & methods

Enzyme expression & purification

Two variants of LARGE1 were generated, both from the human LARGE1 (xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase) gene, obtained from the Forchheimer plasmid bank (Weizmann Institute of Science, Clone ID 100000367). Both variants were cloned without the transmembrane and cytosolic tail domains into a modified pHLSEC plasmid. The cloning, expression, and purification for this enzyme have been previously described [

71

]. Briefly, the LARGE1 gene with its coiled-coil (LARGE1

ecto

) domain (residues 29–756), with a His tag + GSGG linker at its C-terminal end, was cloned into

pHLsec

using BglII/NotI restriction sites. The same LARGE1 gene without its CC domain (LARGE1

ΔCC

) (residues 92–756), with a 6x His tag + GSGG linker at its N-terminal end was cloned in the same manner. Both plasmids were then separately transfected into HEK293F cells at a density of approximately 1 x 10

6

million cells/ml. The transfections occurred with 40 kDa poylethylenamine at a ratio of 1:2.5 DNA:PEI (PEI Max, PolySciences). The productions were harvested after 1 week, spun down at 600 xg (the cells were then discarded), and the supernatants was then centrifuged at 15,800 xg to remove cellular debris. The supernatant of each production was then passed through a 0.45 μm Stericup filter (Merck Millipore) and supplemented with 100 μM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.02% sodium azide. After which, the productions were buffer exchanged to TBS (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0) using a Pellicon Tangential Flow Filtration system (Merck Millipore) and purified by their 6x His tag by a 5 ml HiTrap IMAC FF Ni

2+

column (GE Healthcare). Elution from the column was then carried out with 10% imidiazole, and the proteins were concentrated using a 4 ml 30 kDa Amicon (Merck Millipore) and run on a Supderdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a running buffer of TBS + 0.2% sodium azide. The aliquots from the main HPLC peak were then pooled, concentrated using another 4 ml 30 kDa Amicon (Merck Millipore), and finally flash frozen and stored at -80°C.

Cryo-electron microscopy data collection & analysis

LARGE1 variants (0.3 mg/ml) were dispensed onto R 0.6/1 Cu/C Quantifoil grids (EMS) and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot system (Thermo Fisher/FEI; 4°C, 100% humidity) and then stored under cryogenic conditions. Plasma treatment for the grids was carried out at 90 seconds, 15 mA, and plunging used 3.5 μl of samples with a blot force of -1 for 3 seconds. Grids were first screened on the Talos Arctica microscope (200 kV; Thermo Scientific) and then transferred to the Titan Krios 3Gi (300 kV; FEI) with a Gatan K3 direct detection camera for data collection. The beam size used was 900 nm and the magnification was 120,000 X, with a defocus range of -1.6 to -0.6 μm and a pixel size of 0.52 Å.

Data processing was carried out using the cryoSPARC v2 software. For both LARGE1 variants, patch motion correction & CTF estimation were first completed. For the LARGE1

ΔCC

, a total of 7,969 movies were initially obtained and 5,451 movies were then accepted for particle selection using the blob picker. Initially, 1,760,546 particles were chosen. We then extracted the particles using a 400-pixel box, which was Fourier-cropped to a 200-pixel box size with a pixel size of 1.04 Å. After multiple iterations of the 2D classifications, 92,093 particles were finally obtained which belonged to a single class. To improve the GSFCS resolution, we applied a twofold symmetry. The 3D reconstruction had a final GSFSC resolution of 3.65 Å. For LARGE1

ecto

, the same data processing method was used. A total of 5,250 movies were initially obtained, and 4,896 movies were used for further processing. After patch motion correction & CTF estimation, the blob picker in cryoSPARC v2 selected 223,954 particles. Using twofold symmetry, 164,336 particles were chosen, all of which related to a single class. A density map with a final GSFSC resolution of 3.86 Å was then obtained.

Crystallization, X-ray data collection, and structure determination

The initial crystallization hit occurred with the SaltRx screen (Hampton Research) using the Mosquito robot (LLP Labtech) in a 96-well plate (LLP). Optimization was carried out with the Dragonfly robot (LLP), where LARGE1- CC crystals were obtained in a 200 nl drop, at a 1:1 ratio (protein:crystallization reagents), containing 1.0 M Na

dibasic / pH 5.0. PEG 200 (20% final concentration) was added to the crystals as a cryopreservative before storing in liquid N

for transport. Data collection was carried out at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF), with Beamline ID ID30a. A Dectris Eiger 4M detector was used. Diffraction data was successfully obtained using a wavelength of 0.9677 Å to a resolution of 2.6 Å. Data was indexed using XDS [

72

] and subsequently merged and scaled using Aimless [

73

]. Half of the EM density map, corresponding to a single LARGE1 monomer, was used for solving the X-ray structure via molecular replacement with Phaser [

43

], as part of the Phenix suit [

47

]. An initial model was obtained using the Phenix-Autobuild function [

45

]. The model was completed by iterative rounds of manual model building using Coot [

46

] and refinement using Phenix-Refine (NCS & secondary-structure restrains, individual b-factors, TLS, real-space and reciprocal-space coordinate refinement) [

47

].

Mass photometry

LARGE1 samples were analyzed on a Refeyn One

MP

(Refeyne) mass photometer. The calibration curve was carried out using jack bean urease (100 μg/ml) (Sigma). LARGE1 samples were diluted in TBS to approximately 30 nM (2.5 μg/ml) and were analyzed at room temperature over 60 second recordings using the Acquire

MP

software, at 100 frames per second (fps). Analysis occurred using Refeyne’s Discover

MP

software.

construct in a modified pHLsec plasmid. Point mutations were carried out via the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis protocol (Aligent). After sequence verification, mutants were amplified (via MaxiPrep) and transfected into HEK293F cells.

Western blot analysis

Cell lysates, collected 4 days-post transfections, were boiled in 4x sample buffer containing 40% glycerol, 240 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 0.04% Bromophenol blue, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol. Samples were run on a 10% acrylamide, Tris-glycine gel. Western Blot analysis was then carried out using an anti-His antibody (Qiagen) at a 1:2,000 dilution, in Tris-Buffer Saline + Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween) containing 1% BSA, incubated overnight at 4°C. Then, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted at 1:10,000, before being developed with EZ-ECl (Biological Industries).

#### LARGE1 - Article 5: Alteration of LARGE1 abundance in patients and a mouse model of 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy
<Date>: 2024-3-12

Introduction

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disease, is the second most common recessive disorder and caused by pathogenic variants affecting the Survival of Motor Neuron (

SMN1

) gene (localized on the long arm of chromosome 5; 5q-related SMA) subsequently leading to reduced protein abundances [

17

]. SMA is characterized by motor neuron (MN) degeneration leading to severe muscular atrophy, which in the past was often leading to early death [

4

]. Depending on the expression of

SMN2

, a homologous gene copy of

SMN1

, the severity of SMA might range from cases with prenatal onset to cases with adult onset. Given that

SMN2

harbors a polymorphism in exon 7, leading to the production of a protein with reduced stability, expression of

SMN2

can only insufficiently compensate the loss of functional SMN1 [

19

]. Along this line, therapies have mainly focused on increasing full-length SMN expression in patients. Currently, three therapies for SMA are available. These are either based on the promotion of exon-7 inclusion in

SMN2

-derived transcripts using specific Antisense Oligonucleotides [

3

,

11

] or the risdiplam molecule [

8

], or on AAV-based

SMN1

gene replacement [

21

]. Although these therapies significantly ameliorate the severity and progression of SMA, they do not constitute a full cure for SMA. Existing proteinogenic biomarkers that enable disease and therapy monitoring are mostly restricted to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), indicating the need for less invasive markers providing relevant information. Moreover, there is a significant number of non-responders, and an intervention delay strongly impacts on the efficacy—later stages of motor neuron degeneration cannot be reversed by restoration of SMN-expression [

6

,

11

,

14

,

22

]. Thus, complementary, SMN-independent strategies are crucial and should target such SMN-irreversible degenerative processes. Those are defined as pathological alterations that are not reversed by SMN-restoration for a given dose and intervention delay [

14

]. On the other hand, strengthening the activation of molecular processes facilitating neuronal survival might reflect an additional starting point for the invention of supportive therapeutic concepts. Furthermore, this again accentuates the need for (prognostic and minimally invasive) biomarkers predicting motor-response to allow for optimal clinical decision-making [

27

]. In addition to the

SMN2

copy number and less frequent genetic modifiers, only few (invasive) proteinogenic biomarkers are available for SMA, including Cathepsin D [

26

] and neurofilaments (pNF-L, light-chain; pNF-H, heavy chain), which are intermediate filaments and structural proteins of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Both intermediate filaments are secreted to serum/plasma and CSF during axonal damage, thus serving as non-specific markers of neurodegeneration in different diseases [

25

,

31

]. In the plasma of younger patients with SMA type 1 and 2, pNF-H was found to be increased, and a faster decrease was detected during nusinersen treatment in these patients compared to untreated patients [

31

]. A recent study applying proteomic profiling of CSF confirmed the suitability of pNF-L and Cathepsin D and moreover introduced Arylsulfatase B (ARSB), Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (ENTPD2), and Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (IFI30) as the CSF-proteins most predictive of clinical improvement upon therapeutic intervention with nusinersen [

1

]. However, it is important to note that significant changes are mostly identified in patients younger than 1 year of age, limiting the use in clinical routine. In accordance, analysis of CSF for neurofilament level in SMA patients undergoing nusinersen treatment likewise showed a decline in a smaller cohort of young type 1 patients [

24

] without significant correlation with motor response in older patients [

9

,

29

,

30

].

In the light of the emerging and yet available treatment options for SMA and the remaining need to define biomarkers [

28

], we performed a proteomic-based discovery study on CSF derived from SMA type 3 patients before and under nusinersen treatment enabling the identification of LARGE1 as a protein increased in SMA patients pre- and post-treatment with nusinersen compared to controls. Based on this finding, LARGE1 levels were further studied in CSF and serum samples derived from pediatric SMA patients (pre-symptomatic as well as type 1, 2 and 3) and derived from adult SMA type 3 patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Investigation of serum aimed to define the potential of LARGE1 to serve as a minimal invasive proteinogenic marker. Additionally, LARGE1 levels were studied by immunofluorescence in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle of a murine model of SMA presenting with late disease onset at two different ages.

Materials and methods

Cerebrospinal fluid samples of SMA patients

CSF samples of 35 adult patients (age 16–65 years; demographic data of patients are provided in Supplementary Tab. 1 online resource) and of 14 pediatric cases (age 8–12 years; demographic data of patients are provided in Supplementary Tab. 2 online resource) with genetically proven 5q- SMA (type 1, 2, or 3, respectively), as well as controls, were analyzed. Moreover, serum samples derived from 8 adult patients (age 16–65 years) 3 and as well as 8 adult controls were analyzed in addition to 14 pediatric cases (age 1–6 years) with 5q-SMA (SMA type 1 to 3). All patients or their caregivers gave written informed consent. Control CSF was obtained from non-SMA patients (diagnostic procedure to exclude CNS disease; non-disease controls) and from non-SMA patients with inflammatory (

n

= 11 pediatric and

n

= 3 adult) and non-inflammatory CNS diseases (

n

= 6 pediatric and

n

= 2 adult) serving as disease controls. Serum control samples were obtained from healthy donors (non-disease controls) or patients suffering from other neuromuscular conditions (disease controls with genetically confirmed

VWA1

-related neuromyopathy (adult;

n

= 6),

BICD2

-related spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMALED with adult onset;

n

= 6), and

CHRNE

-related congenital myasthenic syndrome (pediatric;

n

= 7)). SMA-patients responding to therapeutic intervention with nusinersen (were distinguished from such not responding according to the Scores on the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND). Ranging from 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating better motor function; a CHOP INTEND non-response was defined as a failure of an increase of at least 4 points from baseline. The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) is a neurological examination consisting of 26 items, each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, designed for evaluating infants between 2 and 24 months of age. Motor scores of adult patients were measured using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) score or the Revised Upper Limp Module (RULM). Treatment response was classified with an increase of 3 or more motor points. The time point of 180 days post-treatment was chosen as it reflects the ending of the nusinersen “loading phase” and the beginning of the “maintenance phase”, thus providing the full nusinersen effect for each patient and providing robust information regarding the value of therapy markers. Study approval was obtained from the University Duisburg-Essen ethics committee (approval number 18-8285-BO).

Proteomic profiling on human CSF

Sample preparation

Human CSF samples were stored on -80 °C until further processing. A total of 50 μl of each sample (

n

= 16; 2 samples from non-SMA affected individuals, 4 samples from SMA patients not responding to treatment with nusinersen and 10 samples from SMA patients responding to treatment with nusinersen) was denatured with Biognosys’ Denature Buffer. Reduction and alkylation were carried out by adding Biognosys’ Reduction/Alkylation Solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Digestion was then performed with 0.5 μg trypsin (Promega) per sample overnight at 37 °C.

Clean-up for mass spectrometry

After digestion, samples were desalted using a BioPureSPEMIDI C18 spin plate (The Nest Group) following the manufacturer’s instructions and dried using a SpeedVac system. Peptides were then dissolved in 20 μl of 1% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (FA). Prior to mass spectrometric measurements, iRT calibration peptides from Biognosys were added to all samples prepared in this manner. Peptide concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher).

HPRP fractionation

To perform high-pH fractionation of peptides, equal volumes of digested samples were pooled according to time point (pool 1: baseline, pool 2: 6 months). Ammonium hydroxide was added to achieve a pH > 10. Fractionation was performed using a DionexUltiMate3000 RS pump (ThermoScientific) on an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm column (Waters). The gradient was 1% to 40% solvent B in 20 min, the solvents were A: 20 mM ammonium format in water, B: acetonitrile. Fractions were collected every 30 s and sequentially combined into 6 fraction pools. These were allowed to dry and dissolved in 17 μl solvent A. Before mass spectrometric analyses, they were spiked with iRT calibration peptides from Biognosys. Peptide concentrations were determined using a UV/Vis spectrometer (SPECTROstarNano, BMG Labtech).

Shotgun LC–MS/MS for spectral library generation

For DDA LC–MS/MS analyses, 2 µg of peptides per sample or fraction were loaded onto a self-packed C18 column (Dr. Maisch ReproSilPur, 1.9 μm particle size, 120 Å pore size; 75 μm inner diameter, 50 cm length, New Objective) in a Thermo Scientific Easy nLC1200 nano-liquid chromatography system. This system was coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer with a standard nano-electrospray source. The following were used as solvents: A: 1% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% FA; B: 15% water in acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA. The following method was used as the nonlinear gradient: 1–52% solvent B in 120 min, followed by 52–90% B in 10 s, 90% B for 10 min, 90–1% B in 10 s, and 1% B for 5 min. The MS method used was a modified TOP12 method by [

15

]. Full MS covered the m/z range of 350–1650 with a resolution of 70 000 (AGC target value was set to 3e6) and was followed by MS/MS scans with a resolution of 17 500 (AGC target value was 5e5). The isolation width of the MS/MS acquisition precursor was 2 m/z, while the normalized collision energy was set at 25 (10% staged collision energy) and the default charge state was 2 + .

HRM mass spectrometry acquisition

Exactly as for the DDA LC–MS/MS measurements, 2 μg of peptides per sample were loaded onto the in-house packed C18 column in a Thermo Scientific Easy nLC1200 nano-liquid chromatography system for the DIA measurements. The system was coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer equipped with a standard nano-electrospray source. The LC solvents were A: 1% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% FA; B: 15% water in acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA. The nonlinear LC gradient was 1–55% solvent B in 120 min, followed by 55–90% B in 10 s, 90% B for 10 min, 90–1% B in 10 s, and 1% B for 5 min. The DIA method included a one full range scan followed by 22 DIA windows.

Database search of LC–MS/MS data and spectral library generation

Shotgun and HRM mass spectrometry data were analysed using SpectroMine software (Biognosys). The false discovery rate was set to 1% at the peptide and protein levels. Data were validated against a human UniProt protein database (Homo sapiens, 2019-–07-01). The search preferences were set as follows: 2 missed cleavages were allowed. Modifications were set as variable for N-term acetylation, methionine oxidation, deamidation (NQ), carbamylation (KR)). To create a CSF resource spectral library, shotgun data were obtained from commercially available healthy individual CSF and searched using the above settings. Shotgun, HRM, and resource search data were used to create a hybrid spectral library (library ID: 2452_R03) in SpectroMine software.

HRM data analysis

HRM mass spectrometric data were analysed using Spectronaut Pulsar software (Biognosys) with the hybrid spectral library generated in this project. The false discovery rate on protein and peptide level was set to 1%, data was filtered using row-based extraction. The HRM measurements analyzed with Spectronaut were normalized using local regression normalization [

2

].

Data analysis

Data analysis and plotting was performed in R. Distance in heat maps was calculated using the “manhattan” method, the clustering using “ward.D” for both axis. Principal component analysis was conducted in R using prcomp and a modified ggbiplot function for plotting, and partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed using mixOMICS package.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

The level of LARGE1 were measured in CSF and serum samples derived from adult and pediatric SMA patients and matching controls by making use of the ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s protocol (#MBS281249, MyBioScource, San Diego, CA, USA).

(4 copies) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Habor, ME, USA) and bred in the Animal Research Lab of the University Hospital Essen. Male and female mice were used for spinal cord tissue (P10, P20, P28, P42, and P52) harvesting and muscle tissue (

Musculus tibialis anterior

(TA)) at postnatal days P10, P28, and P52. Age-matched male FVB/N mice (wild-type, wt) served as control. At P42, SMA mice already show loss of spinal motor neurons [

18

].

All animals were kept on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with water and standard food pellets available ad libitum.

All experiments were conducted under the animal welfare guidelines of the University Duisburg Essen. Furthermore, the use of the SMA mouse model was approved by the State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV) in North Rhine-Westphalia (reference number 81–02.04.2020.A335).

Preparation of murine spinal cord tissue and tibialis anterior as well as human quadriceps muscle slices

Lumbar spinal cord tissue of late-onset SMA and wild-type mice were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until usage. Spinal cord cryosections of 20 µm were prepared. Every fifth section of each spinal cord is placed on one independent microscopy slide.

The murine TA was removed and immediately snap-frozen in a mold of Tissue-Tek

®

O.C.T.

™

Compound on dry ice in isopropanol. Afterwards, muscles were stored at − 80 °C until usage. Muscle cryosections of 12 µM were prepared for immunostaining studies. For immunostaining studies on quadriceps muscle derived from pediatric SMA type 3 patients (muscle biopsies were collected for diagnostic purposes), 10 µM cryosections were used.

Immunostaining of spinal cord tissue slices and muscle biopsy specimen

Murine lumbar spinal cord or TA sections were fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized (PBS, 0.1

v/w

Triton X-100), and blocked (PBS, 5% bovine albumin serum). Primary antibodies for motor neurons (anti-SMI-32, mouse, 1:400, #801,701, BioLegends, San Diego, CA, USA), LARGE1 (anti-LARGE1, rabbit, 1:500, #PA5-78,393, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Taufkirchen, Germany), Golgi marker GM130 (anti-GM130, mouse, 1:500, #AB169276, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and BiP (GRP78) (anti-BiP BD, mouse, 1:500, Transduction Laboratories #610,978) were diluted in blocking solution and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Sections were washed, and secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, 1:300, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and DAPI (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) were diluted in blocking solution. Sections were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature.

Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 Apotome (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope and Zeiss Zen software to determine the relative protein levels. All microscope settings such as laser intensity, exposure time, or contrast were kept the same to analyze LARGE1, GM130 and BiP immunoreactivities.

Immunoreactivity of LARGE1 in the entire ventral horn or SMI-32 positive spinal motor neurons as well as in the TA sections and immunoreactivity of GM130 and BiP was measured using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). LARGE1, GM130 or BiP immunoreactivity was measured and normalized against the background of each slice.

The relative protein level of LARGE1 or GM130 was calculated by normalizing the intensity of SMA tissue against wild-type tissue.

Colocalization of LARGE1 and GM130 as well as LARGE1 and BiP was determined using Image J software plug-in “Coloc 2” and calculation of Pearson coefficient.

Western blot analysis

We performed Western blot analysis to substantiate the evaluated protein level by immunostaining. Therefore, the spinal cord tissue of SMA or wt mice were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany). The amount of protein in those lysates was determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay.

Ten micrograms of protein were applied to 4–15% TGX Stain-Free gels (Biorad, Germany), and proteins were transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting technique. Images of membranes were taken for total-protein evaluation. Afterward, the membranes were incubated in fast-blocking solution (Biorad, Germany) under gentle agitation for 10 min at RT. Then, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (in blocking solution) against LARGE1 (anti-rabbit, 1:10,000) at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody against β-actin (hFAB,1:10,000 #12,004,164 BioRad, Germany; anti mouse 1:10,000 #ab8226 Abcam, United Kingdom) as well as GAPDH (anti-mouse, 1:10,000, # MA5-15,738, Thermo-Fisher) was used as an additional loading control.

After washing, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1.5 h at RT. Immunoreactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate and a Western blot imaging system (Biorad, Germany).

Analysis of Western blot signals was performed using Biorad imaging software. First, the signal of each protein and actin lane was measured. Then, the protein signal of each lane was normalized to its total protein value (PonceauS). Finally, the calculated protein level of SMA mice was further normalized to the value detected in age-matched wt mice, and additionally the wt mice were normalized.

All Western blots and total protein staining used for mean value calculations are provided in the supplementary material (Supplementary Figs. 7–8 online resource).

Results

Unbiased proteomic profiling identified increase LARGE1 in CSF derived from SMA type 3 patients responding to therapy with nusinersen

To identify novel CSF-related biomarkers of therapeutical relevance for SMA, untargeted proteomic profiling was carried out on CSF derived from adult SMA type 3 patients (n = 14 with additional 2 non-disease controls) pre- and post-treatment with nusinersen as a discovery approach. For post-treatment conditions day 180 (prior fifth application of nusinersen) was chosen. Our cohort also included two patients not showing a clinical amelioration after 180 days of therapy (non-responders). In total, 17 proteins were significantly changed between baseline samples (day 0) from responder and non-responder SMA patients including LARGE1 (ratio 2.62; Log ratio 1.39; p-ANOVA = 0.03) (Fig.

1

; Supplementary Tab. 3 online resource). Given that LARGE1 (acting as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase with both alpha-1,3-xylosyltransferase and beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase activities) is localized to the ER-Golgi network and other ER-Golgi resident proteins were already unveiled as critical factors for motor neuron survival in SMA [

5

] and other motor neuron diseases such as ALS [

10

], were selected this protein as promising candidate for further analyses. This decision was also motivated by the known role of LARGE1 in the genesis of neuromuscular diseases (MIM: 608,840 & MIM:613,154).

ELISA-based quantification of LARGE1 in SMA-patient derived CSF samples

To validate our proteomic findings and to further elucidate the potential of LARGE1 to serve as a (therapeutic relevant) biomarker for SMA, ELISA-based quantification of LARGE1 level was carried out in CSF samples derived from pediatric patients suffering from SMA type 1 (

n

= 3), type 2 (

n

= 4) and type 3 (

n

= 3) responding to therapeutic intervention as well as in 4 pediatric non-responders in addition to adult patients suffering from SMA type 3 (

n

= 18). Moreover, LARGE1 was quantified in pediatric and adult disease controls (inflammatory and non-inflammatory CNS diseases). Results of these studies show an increase of LARGE1 level in CSF derived from adult SMA-patients 180 days post treatment with nusinersen (Fig.

2

a and b;

p

< 0.01;

p

= 0.051). This effect was similar in patients responding to treatment and not responding to treatment (Fig.

2

b and c). However, in adult patients not responding to therapy, lower LARGE1 levels are identified in CSF at baseline visits compared to controls and patients responding to treatment (Fig.

2

b and c). This finding not only confirms our proteomic results but moreover yields into a higher delta value of LARGE1 in pg/ml in the non-responder cohort (720.4) compared to the responder cohort (320.5). In pediatric patients, increase of LARGE1 levels in CSF at baseline visit is more pronounced compared to the observation obtained in the adult cohort and independent of the SMA sub-type or effect of therapeutic intervention with nusinersen. Moreover, a further increase of LARGE1 in CSF is observed in all SMA sub-types responding to therapy, whereas non-responders, in contrast, show a decrease of LARGE1 at day 180 (Fig.

2

d–h). The latter finding is in line with our proteomic data. This—in contrast to the data obtained in the adult cohort—in turn results in a negative delta value of LARGE1 in pg/ml in the non-responder cohort (− 256,2) compared to the responder cohort (175,4). LARGE1 levels are significantly increased in pediatric patients compared to adult patients (

p

< 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 1 online resource). We also quantified the levels of LARGE1 in the CSF of both adult and pediatric patients afflicted with different central nervous system (CNS) diseases, and compared these measurements with those obtained from SMA (Supplementary Fig. 2 online resource). Analysis revealed a significant elevation of LARGE1 in the CSF of SMA patients, especially the pediatric CSF was increased compared to non-inflammatory and inflammatory CSF in pediatric patients (

p

< 0.001;

p

< 0.05). In the pediatric and adult disease controls LARGE1 level were rather decreased: 119.0 pg/ml and 56.4 pg/ml (inflammatory and non-inflammatory CNS diseases in pediatric patients, respectively), as well as 110.7 pg/ml and 45.8 pg/ml (inflammatory and non-inflammatory CNS diseases in adult patients, respectively).

To investigate a potential correlation between altered (elevated) LARGE1 levels in CSF and therapeutic outcome in terms of improvement of motor function, delta of different motor scores was calculated for each patient and correlated with delta of LARGE1 protein levels (baseline versus day 180 post treatment). Whereas for RULM, this approach showed no correlation between the increase of LARGE1 in CSF and improved motor function, for HFMSE, four patients showed an increase of LARGE1 without an effect on improved HFMSE score. Thus, eight patients showed increased LARGE1 level accompanied by improvement of the HFMSE score (Fig.

3

a and b). HINE score was available for six pediatric patients and showed an increase accompained by increase of LARGE1 level in CSF for four of these patients (Fig.

ELISA-based quantification of LARGE1 in SMA-patient derived serum samples

We next addressed the potential of LARGE1 to serve as a minimal invasive biomarker by investigating the level in serum samples derived from adult and pediatric SMA patients at baseline visit: the investigation of 8 adult patients (4 responder and 4 non-responder) revealed a significant increase of LARGE1 level in serum samples derived from the patient cohort compared to controls (

n

= 5). However, when comparing responders and non-responders, only patients which show a clinical benefit from therapeutic intervention present with a profound and significant elevation of LARGE1 level whereas the increase in non-responders was rather mild an statistically not significant (Fig.

4

a–c). However, in the pediatric cohort (

n

= 17), no increase of LARGE1 serum level was observed in SMA patients (Fig.

4

d). A subcategorization of the pediatric cases according to the clinical presentation (pre-symptomatic and SMA 1–3) did also not reveal a statistical significant increase in one of these subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 3 online resource). Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of baseline LARGE1 levels in serum samples derived from pediatric and adult patients with SMA against the serum LARGE1 levels observed in various other neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Serum samples from pediatric and adult SMA patients exhibited significantly elevated LARGE1 levels when compared to those from patients with other NMDs (

p

< 0.05;

p

< 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. 4 online resource). These other NMDs served as disease controls and included

Mouse model of late-onset SMA shows loss of motor neurons at P42 and P42 but not at P20 or P28

To determine the number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of wild-type or SMA mice, immunostaining for SMI-32, a marker for motor neurons, was performed, and the number of positive neurons was counted (Supplementary Fig. 5a online resource).

At P20 and P28, no reduction in the number of spinal motor neurons in SMA mice was observed, compared to wild-type mice (

p

> 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c online resource). This is in contrast to the findings at P42 and P52. We observed a reduction in the number of spinal motor neurons in SMA mice compared to wild-type mice at the same age (P42 and P52) as well as SMA mice at P20 and P28 (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e online resource). The MN loss can be classified into two stages, the active MN loss starting after P28 to P42 and the stagnation phase starting after P42 to P52 (Supplementary Fig. 5f online resource).

Abundance of LARGE1 in spinal cord tissue of late-onset SMA mouse model is increased at P52 but not at P28

To examine LARGE1 expression in the spinal cord derived from a mouse model of late-onset SMA at two different time points, spinal cord slices were prepared, and immunostaining for LARGE1 and SMI-32 was performed (Fig.

5

a). In addition, immunoreactivity of LARGE1 was measured for the entire ventral horn of the spinal cord and within SMI-32 positive neurons as well.

When comparing LARGE1 immunostaining between SMA-animals and matching controls in relation to the MN loss, identical phases can be identified: a phase of MN loss, commences at P28 and extends until P42, followed by a stagnation phase from P42 to P52. Between P42 and P52, no significant changes in protein levels can be observed (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b online resource). Our Western Blot data show an elevation in LARGE1-protein levels at P10 and P52. When evaluating the temporal progression, LARGE1 exhibits a transient increase at P10, subsequently returning to control levels at P28, and rising again until P52 (Supplementary Fig. 6c and d online resource). Generally, a fundamentally heightened level of LARGE1 protein is evident at P10 (Supplementary Fig. 6c and e online resource). P28 and P52 demonstrate a distinctly reduced protein level of LARGE1 (both wildtype and SMA mouse models) compared to P10 (Supplementary Fig. 4c and e online resource). Further analysis of the non-normalized values from the Western Blot reveals that SMA animals exhibit a significantly elevated protein level at P10 compared to P28 and P52. However, P52 also displays a significant increase relative to P28 (Supplementary Fig. 6e online resource).

GM130 abundance is increased in motor neurons of late-onset SMA mouse model at P52 without alteration in co-localization with LARGE1

Assuming the relevance of the Golgi-resident glycosyltransferase LARGE1 (

https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O95461

) in the central nervous system pathology of SMA, we next performed immunostaining of spinal cord slices to determine the abundance and distribution within the Golgi. For that purpose, co-staining with Golgi matric protein 130 (GM130, a well-established Golgi marker, was carried out in spinal motor neurons of late-onset SMA mouse model at P28 and P52 (Supplementary Fig. 7a online resource): immunoreactivity of GM130 was measured, and co-localization with LARGE1 was calculated using the Pearson coefficient.

Although we observed increased GM130 immunoreactivity in spinal motor neurons of late-onset SMA tissue at P52 (

p

< 0.001) but not a P28 (

p

> 0.05), compared to wild-type conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3b and d), no alteration in GM130/LARGE1 co-localization was observed between wild-type and late-onset SMA mice at P28 or P52 was observed (

p

> 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 7c and e online resource).

BiP abundance is not altered in the late-onset SMA mouse model, but co-localization with LARGE1 is reduced at P52

To further elucidate the impact of subcellular LARGE1 distribution (not co-localizing with GM130) in the etiology of SMA, we moreover performed immunostaining focusing on the localization of LARGE1 to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) forming a functional network with the Golgi. For that purpose, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) was selected as a well-established ER marker, and the level of BiP along with its co-localization with LARGE1 were determined in spinal motor neurons of late-onset SMA mouse model at P28 and P52 (Supplementary Fig. 8a online resource): immunoreactivity of BiP was measured, and co-localization with LARGE1 was calculated using the Pearson coefficient.

We observed no changes within the BiP immunoreactivity in spinal motor neurons of late-onset SMA tissue neither at P28 (

p

> 0.05) nor P52 (

p

> 0.05), compared to wild-type conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4b and d). However, the co-localization of BiP and LARGE1 was significantly reduced between wild-type and late-onset SMA mice at P52 (

p

< 0.001) but not at P28 (

p

> 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 8c and e online resource).

LARGE1 abundance in tissue of tibialis anterior of late-onset SMA mice is increased at P52 but not at P28

To examine LARGE1 level in TA muscle tissues from a mouse model of late-onset SMA at two different time points, cryosections were prepared, and immunostaining for LARGE1 was performed (Fig.

Discussion

Combined results of our study unveil LARGE1 as a novel fluid biomarker in 5q-realted SMA: we demonstrate that LARGE1 is increased in CSF derived from pediatric patients suffering from SMA irrespective of the clinical subtype of the disease but not in CSF derived from children suffering from inflammatory or non-inflammatory CNS diseases. Moreover, in pediatric patients, LARGE1 level further increased in CSF 180 days post-successful treatment with nusinersen whereas an opposite effect was identified in non-responders. These findings may indicate the potential of LARGE1 to serve as a general CSF biomarker in addition to a therapy marker in pediatric SMA. However, increase of CSF LARGE1 in pediatric responders is statistically not significant. Thus, analyses of larger cohorts of treatment responder and non-responder are needed to address the question if this promising finding will yield into statistical significance and will consequently enable a robust patient stratification. Adult SMA patients show increased LARGE1 levels also in patients not responding to therapeutic intervention with nusinersen after 180 days. However, in contrast with the results obtained in the pediatric cohort, adult non-responders show decreased LARGE1 levels compared to controls at baseline visits. In consequence, the fact that the fold of CSF LARGE1-increase upon treatment (almost statistically significant in responders;

p

value = 0.051) does not significantly differ between adult therapy responder and non-responder supports the concept that LARGE1 baseline level should be taking into consideration as a stratification determinant. Regarding the disease genesis and assuming that the increased LARGE1 levels in the serum are attributed to the loss of motor neurons, this molecular observation might reflect that an inadequate therapeutic response is consistent with a greater loss of motor neurons and thus less release of LARGE1 into the CSF. Along this line, we assume that the molecular differences between pediatric and adult SMA-patients reflect the profound motor neuron-degeneration associated with early onset of SMA in the pediatric cohort versus the adult cohort. This assumption is supported by the results of our experiments towards LARGE1 quantification in spinal cord derived from a late-onset SMA mouse model. Here, immunological-based studies unveiled no LARGE1 increase in ventral horn or SMI-32 positive cells at P20 and P28 but at P42 and P52 in turn suggesting a later involvement of LARGE1 increase in the molecular etiology of late-onset SMA. Along this line, the decrease in pediatric non-responders may reflect the progressive loss of LARGE1-expressing neurons impacting on the amount of release of this protein from damaged/ apoptotic neurons to the CSF whereas lower base-line level in adult SMA patients classified as therapy non-responders may reflect an insufficient compensatory LARGE1-upregulation during in the molecular etiology of the disease. This is in line with the assumption that in adult SMA-patients (therapy responders) LARGE1 acts as a possible rescue mechanism (preventing motor neuron degeneration and associated release of cellular proteins to the CSF) and as such is not being released into the CSF like in pediatric patients. A general protective role of LARGE1 in SMA is also suggested by the identification of decreased level in CSF derived from pediatric and adult disease controls in turn supporting the concept a less pronounced LARGE1 degradation in SMA. The weak correlation coefficient between Δscore of each motor function scale and ΔLARGE1 CSF level might indicate that changes in LARGE1 level molecularly precede associated functional outcomes. To prove this assumption further longitudinal studies are needed. Of note, similar observations were described for other SMA-related biomarker studies: a biomarker study on 16 adults with SMA type 3 and 4 under Nusinersen treatment over 22 months reported on a significant decrease of pNF-H and increase of Chitotriosidase-1 (CHIT1) in CSF upon treatment but no correlation of this molecular change with clinical outcome measures. In contrast, a decrease of Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) which was observed upon therapeutic intervention strongly correlated with improvements in the revised upper limb module (RULM) [

7

]. These findings highlight that therapy markers in SMA do not necessarily correlate with clinical outcome measures even in adult patients in which uniformed standardized motor tests are applicable. Although further studies on larger cohorts are also needed to decipher whether decreased LARGE1 levels at baseline in adult non-responders and decrease of LARGE1 at day 180 after treatment in pediatric non-responders hold the potential to distinguish between patients showing a benefit of nusinersen treatment and such showing no improvement in motor scores, our data suggest that LARGE1 may serve as a therapy relevant marker in CSF of both adult and pediatric patients. The observed LARGE1 decrease in CSF samples derived from pediatric controls hint towards a specificity of LARGE1 increase in CSF in SMA with pediatric onset. However, further studies on CSF samples derived from children suffering from other neurological diseases are needed to draw final conclusions.

Testing the potential of LARGE1 to serve as a minimal-invasive fluid biomarker was addressed by investigating serum samples derived from adult and pediatric SMA patients at baseline visits. Indeed, in adult patients, a significant LARGE1 increase was detected, and subcategorization of patients into responder and non-responder even unraveled a prediction of future clinical response to therapeutic intervention by showing elevated levels only in responders but not in non-responders. However, our data also indicate that in serum, LARGE1 only holds the potential to serve as a predictive biomarker in adult patients, as in pediatric cases, no changes in LARGE1 serum concentration were detected. LARGE1 was also significantly decreased in serum samples derived from disease controls reflecting other neuromuscular diseases with impaired neuromuscular transmission compared to the level detected in SMA-patients. This result is in line with the molecular observation obtained in CSF samples and in principle supports the assumption of a generalized protective role of LARGE1 in SMA (see above). Doubtless, studies on larger cohorts are needed to further validate this finding and thus to introduce LARGE1 as a robust predictive and specific blood biomarker in adult SMA patients. The molecular observation that LARGE1 is not elevated serum of pediatric cases but is higher in adults after a long period of disease progression, might hint toward a constant release of this protein from the muscle cells, which are increasingly vulnerable due to disease progression in adults, whereas in the childhood forms skeletal muscle shows profound damage very early on [

26

]. This in turn suggests the above-mentioned compensatory role of the LARGE1 increase also in muscle. Functional studies ideally on mouse models representing the different onset forms of SMA are crucial to address the exact role of LARGE1 increase in different tissues in relation to varying severity grades of this neurological disorder. Such studies may also clarify why LARGE1 is conversely elevated with treatment in CSF and along this line if LARGE1 plays different roles within different affected cellular populations.

LARGE1 encodes the bifunctional glycosyltransferase with both alpha-1,3-xylosyltransferase and beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase activities involved in the maturation of alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1), in turn enabling DAG1 to bind ligands, including laminin 211 and neurexin. Recessive pathogenic variants in

LARGE1

lead to muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies type A6; MIM: 613,154) and muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with mental retardation type B6; MIM: 608,840). An impact of LARGE1 in proper function of neuromuscular transmission has already been shown in previous studies: deficits in nerve conduction and neuromuscular transmission were observed in LARGE (

myd

) animals, and these deficits were fully rescued by muscle-specific expression of LARGE1, which resulted in restored structure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [

13

]. Based on this observation, Gumerson and colleagues postulate that in addition to muscle degeneration, impaired neuromuscular transmission contributes to muscle weakness in

myd

mice and that the noted defects are primarily due to the effects of LARGE1 and glycosylated dystroglycan in stabilizing the NMJ [

13

]. Additionally, a study was designed to explore differentially expressed genes associated with acute and chronic stages of spinal cord injury and unraveled

Large1

as being differentially expressed [

23

]. Moreover, neuropathological findings indicate that LARGE1 also plays a role in the spinal cord: the spinal cord of a LARGE1-autopsy case was smaller than normal and had a “sombrero hat” configuration, indicative of degeneration or absence of the corticospinal tracts [

20

]. Our finding of increased LARGE1 in the skeletal muscle of SMA mice accords with its muscular role in proper neuromuscular transmission and moreover supports the concept of SMA being a multisystemic disease with primary vulnerability of skeletal musculature rather than being “a pure” MN-disorder [

12

]. The impact of elevated LARGE1 in SMA-diseased skeletal muscle derived from a mouse model of SMA type 3 is even supported by the identification of increased LARGE1 serum level in adult SMA patients. However, further functional studies are needed to precisely delineate to role of LARGE1 in muscle- of SMA and, along this line, to link elevated serum levels to muscle cell vulnerability. The finding of increased abundance of LARGE1 in MN of 52-day-old SMA mice supports the concept of a profound role of this protein in MN survival as already indicated by the neuropathological findings obtained in a LARGE1-autopsy case [

20

]. This assumption is also supported by our finding of increased LARGE1 level in CSF of SMA patients compared to controls characterized by a further LARGE1-increase in pediatric and adult cases under nusinersen therapy. The latter observation might arise from the activation of survival programs in MNs promoted by the restoration of efficient expression of a functional SMA protein. One might speculate that LARGE1 level in CSF allows to differentiate between pediatric responders and non-responders to nusinersen therapy but not between the same ones in adult patients. Again, further studies on larger cohorts of pediatric and adult responders and non-responders are crucial to finally draw this conclusion. GM130 (also known as Golgi subfamily A member 2) is a 130 kDa

cis

-Golgi protein encoded by

GOLGA2

. GM130 is a peripheral membrane component of the cis-Golgi stack that acts as a membrane skeleton maintaining the structure and integrity of the Golgi apparatus and as a vesicle tether that facilitates vesicle fusion to the Golgi membrane and, moreover, acts in cell proliferation and autophagy. Recessive loss of function variants in

GOLGA2

was linked to a neurological phenotype defined by microcephaly, seizures, and myopathy [

16

], in turn indicating the impact of GM130 on proper integrity and function of both the nervous system and skeletal muscle. Thus, an increase of GM130 in MNs of the SMA mouse model and muscle cells of SMA patients might accord with the activation of defense mechanisms toward cellular survival. However, further functional studies are crucial to confirm the assumption and to precisely delineate the role of GM130 in survival of cell populations along the neuromuscular axis. Given that elevated LARGE1 level did not correlate with an increase of co-localization with GM130, we assumed an interplay of LARGE1 elevation and the ER forming a functional continuum with the Golgi apparatus. To prove this assumption, co-localization studies with BiP (known ER marker) were carried out in murine spinal cord, revealing a decrease in the co-localization of both proteins. This microscopic finding may hint toward an impact of subcellular LARGE1 distribution and further functions of LARGE1 in the molecular etiology of SMA. Further functional studies, such as investigations of the LARGE1 interactome, would be helpful in deciphering the exact role in the pathophysiology of SMA.

Conclusions

LARGE1 level in CSF enable to distinguish between SMA-cases responding and not responding to nusinersen therapy in both, adult patients (based on baseline level) and pediatric patients (based on level 180 days post-treatment). Moreover, LARGE1 serves as a (minimal invasive) serum biomarker only in adult SMA patients and here even enables to predict treatment response based on baseline protein level.

LARGE1 is increased in spinal cord and skeletal muscle of a SMA3 mouse model upon disease progression. The decreased interaction of LARGE1 with BiP in murine spinal cord and may hint toward a yet undiscovered role of subcellular LARGE1 distribution in the molecular etiology of SMA as a multisystemic disorder. The observed decrease of LARGE1 in CSF and serum derived from patients suffering from other neurological diseases support the concept of a protective role of LARGE1 in SMA. Our combined data thus introduce LARGE1 as a novel SMA biomarker holding the potential to address different demands such as suitability in patient stratification, specificity, pathophysiological relevance and reflection of treatment response.

#### CELSR1 - Article 1: CELSR1 Promotes Neuroprotection in Cerebral Ischemic Injury Mainly through the Wnt/PKC Signaling Pathway
<Date>: 2020-2-13

<Full Text Content>:
1. Introduction

Stroke is the second-most fatal disease worldwide [

1

], and approximately 87% of stroke cases are ischemic stroke triggered by blood flow blockage within major cerebral arteries. Currently, the only FDA-approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke is intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) [

2

], but the majority of patients cannot benefit from this agent due to its narrow treatment time window and association with hemorrhagic complications [

3

,

4

]. Therefore, it is necessary to find other more effective therapies for cerebral ischemia.

Cerebral ischemic can induce spontaneous neurological repair processes, including neurogenesis and angiogenesis [

5

,

6

]. Adult neurogenesis occurs mainly in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) [

7

,

8

]. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, neural stem cells (NSCs) in the SVZ can generate many neuroblasts and migrate to the ischemic penumbra, improving neurological functional recovery [

9

]. Cerebral ischemia injury can stimulate the expression of endogenous vascular-related factors, thereby promoting the rapid proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, and migrate to the damaged areas to form new blood vessels, providing nutrients and oxygen for the neurons in the ischemic penumbra [

5

,

10

].

CELSR1 is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor [

11

,

12

,

13

,

14

].

Celsr1

was identified as a susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals by a genome-wide association study [

15

,

16

]. Recent evidence has suggested that CELSR1 regulates the direction of dendrite initiation sites [

17

,

18

]. In vitro, CELSR1 is a positive regulator of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis [

19

]. In addition, CELSR1 is also a key component of the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, and it is involved with Fzd3, Fzd6, Dvl1, Dvl2 and Vangl2 in the Wnt/PCP pathway [

20

,

21

]. In this decade, more studies have indicated that the noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway also regulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis [

22

,

23

,

24

]. Thus far, the role of CELSR1 in cerebral ischemia is still unclear. To address these questions, we administered lentiviral microinjections to MCAO rats to knock down the expression of Celsr1 to assess the role of CELSR1 in neuroprotection, neurogenesis and angiogenesis in cerebral ischemia in an MCAO model.

2. Results

2.1. The Expression Level of Celsr1 Increased Significantly in the Ischemic SVZ and DG

To test whether CELSR1 participates in the process of cerebral ischemia, we investigated the mRNA expression of

Celsr1

by quantitative RT-PCR after 2 h of ischemia/22 h of reperfusion. Compared to that in the sham group (100%), the mRNA expression of

Celsr1

in the MCAO group was significantly increased in the SVZ and DG (SVZ: 271.4% ± 48.69%,

p

= 0.0180; DG: 175.9% ± 26.26%,

p

= 0.0446,

Figure 1

A), decreased in the ischemic penumbra (83.74% ± 3.635%,

p

= 0.0110,

Figure 1

A), and showed no obvious change in the ischemic core (58.81% ± 28.14%,

p

= 0.2809,

Figure 1

A) and striatum (71.53% ± 15.89%,

p

= 0.1477,

Figure 1

A). These results suggest that CELSR1 may play a role in cerebral ischemic injury.

2.2. A Celsr1-shRNA Lentivirus Was Constructed and Microinjected into the Brain

To identify the roles of CELSR1 in cerebral ischemic injury, a

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed. To test the efficiency of

Celsr1

knockdown, HEK293T cells were transfected with the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus and a control lentivirus. According to the results of quantitative RT-PCR, the interference efficiency of the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus reached approximately 50% compared to that of the control lentivirus (54.88% ± 8.69% vs. 100%,

p

= 0.0016,

Figure 1

B). The

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus and control lentivirus were microinjected into the lateral ventricle and DG of rats. After 12 days, rats underwent MCAO. The rats were sacrificed three days after MCAO (

Figure 1

C).

2.3. Knockdown of Celsr1 in the SVZ Accelerated Brain Injury Induced by Ischemia/Reperfusion

The

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus and control lentivirus were microinjected into the SVZ of rats twelve days before MCAO. After 2 h of ischemia/70 h of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed. Then, the cerebral infarct volume was assessed. The group treated with

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus had a significantly larger infarct volume than the control group (0.06% ± 0.02% vs. 0.14% ± 0.03%,

p

= 0.047

Figure 2

A,B). Neurological deficits were assessed after 22 h, 46 h and of reperfusion following 2 h of ischemia. The

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group showed a significantly higher Bederson score than that of the control group at different time points, peaking after 2 h of ischemia/46 h of reperfusion (1.26 ± 0.09 vs. 2.2 ± 0.17,

p

< 0.001,

Figure 2

C). Interestingly, we found that most of the rats that died after MCAO were in the

Celsr1

-shRNA group. Therefore, we calculated the mortality of rats in the control group and

Celsr1

-shRNA group after MCAO. Compared to that of the control group, the mortality rate caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury in the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group increased three-fold (

Figure 2

D). This shows that

Celsr1

knockdown increased the brain infarct volume and neurological deficit score and then led to animal death. This suggests that CELSR1 has a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury.

2.4. Celsr1 Knockdown in the SVZ Increased the Percentage of Apoptotic Cells in the Peri-infarct Cerebral Cortex

The mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of CELSR1 was explored. Can

Celsr1

knockdown promote cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex to increase brain injury? Cleaved caspase-3 and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were applied to brain sections. Compared with that in the control group, the number of caspase-3-positive cells in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex was increased significantly in the SVZ of the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group (59.72 ± 4.14 vs. 35.5 ± 2.40,

p

= 0.0001,

Figure 3

A,B). Both the cleaved caspase-3-positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells were apoptotic cells. There were more TUNEL-positive cells in the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group than in the control group (129.10 ± 5.34 vs. 80.58 ± 9.90,

p

= 0.0001,

Figure 3

C,D). These results indicate that

Celsr1

knockdown in the SVZ can increase the number of apoptotic cells in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex.

2.5. Celsr1 Knockdown in the SVZ Inhibited Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis after Cerebral Ischemia

Another mechanism by which CELSR1 exerts neuroprotection was explored by investigating neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the SVZ. BrdU (a marker that labels newborn cells) and DCX (an immature neuronal marker) were used to identify neurogenesis in the SVZ. There were fewer BrdU/nestin-positive cells in the SVZ of the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group than in the SVZ of the control group (68.91% ± 5.41% vs. 40.00% ± 5.29%,

p

= 0.0008,

Figure 4

A,B). CD31 (a marker of vascular endothelial cells) was used to evaluate angiogenesis around the SVZ. The

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group had a lower CD31-positive vascular area ratio around the SVZ (12.88% ± 2.11%) than the control group (24.61% ± 3.68%,

p

= 0.0109,

Figure 4

C,D). These results indicate that

Celsr1

knockdown inhibits neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the SVZ.

2.6. Celsr1 Knockdown in the SVZ Suppressed the Wnt/PKC Signaling Pathway after Cerebral Ischemia

To deeply clarify the neuroprotective mechanism of CELSR1 in cerebral ischemic injury, tissues of the SVZ and ischemic penumbra from the control group and

Celsr1

-shRNA group were harvested. The results showed that the expression level of p-PKC was significantly reduced in two brain areas in the

Celsr1

-shRNA group compared to the control group (SVZ: 0.52 ± 0.12 vs. 1.09 ± 0.11,

p

= 0.004,

Figure 5

A,B; ischemic penumbra: 0.62 ± 0.13 vs. 1.00 ± 0.07,

p

= 0.0396,

Figure 5

C,D), but the expression levels of PKC, p-JNK, JNK and β-catenin were not obviously different in the

Celsr1

-shRNA group compared to the control group. These results indicate that the neuroprotection exerted by CELSR1 in cerebral ischemic injury may occur through the Wnt/PKC signaling pathway.

2.7. Celsr1 Knockdown in the DG Had no Influence on Cell Apoptosis in the Peri-infarct Cerebral Cortex or Neurological Deficit Scores

To deeply test the neuroprotection exerted by CELSR1 in cerebral ischemic injury, the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus and control lentivirus were microinjected into the DG of the hippocampus twelve days before MCAO. Immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL staining were used to identify cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex. The numbers of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells (34 ± 2.29 vs. 41.36 ± 3.38,

p

= 0.0814,

Figure 6

A,B) and TUNEL-positive cells (117.50 ± 9.20 vs. 110.40 ± 5.86,

p

= 0.5056,

Figure 6

C,D) were not significantly different between the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group and the control group. Similarly, we found that the neurological deficit score of the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group was not significantly different from that of the control group (1.67 ± 0.33 vs. 1.33 ± 0.33,

p

= 0.5185,

Figure 6

E). These results indicate that CELSR1 in the DG might not be neuroprotective against cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex.

2.8. Celsr1 Knockdown in the DG Inhibited Neurogenesis but did not Affect Angiogenesis after Cerebral Ischemia

Next, neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the DG were explored. BrdU and DCX were used to identify neurogenesis in the DG. Compared with that in the control group, the number of BrdU/DCX-positive cells in the

Celsr1

-shRNA group was significantly reduced (6.00% ± 0.58% vs. 1.60% ± 0.33%,

p

= 0.0029,

Figure 7

A,B). In the peri-infarct cerebral cortex, the CD31-positive vascular area ratio in the

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus group was similar to that in the control group (34.91% ± 7.42% vs. 41.54% ± 3.75%,

p

= 0.4391

Figure 7

C,D). These results suggest that CELSR1 in the DG promotes neurogenesis but did not affect angiogenesis in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex.

3. Discussion

In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of CELSR1 on cerebral ischemia in MCAO rats. The present data provide the first evidence that knocking down the expression of

Celsr1

in the SVZ increases cell apoptosis and the infarct volume and reduces neurogenesis and angiogenesis and the motor function and survival rate of MCAO rats. Moreover, the expression of p-PKC was downregulated in the SVZ and peri-infarct tissue. Knocking down

Celsr1

expression in the DG only reduced neurogenesis. Therefore, CELSR1 has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia injury by reducing cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex and promoting neurogenesis and angiogenesis, mainly through the Wnt/PKC pathway (

Figure 8

).

In this study, we observed for the first time the neuroprotective effect of CELSR1 on cerebral ischemia injury by knocking down the expression of

Celsr1

with a lentivirus in MCAO rats. Although

Celsr1

has been identified as a susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke [

15

,

16

], the role of CELSR1 in cerebral ischemia injury is unknown. The rats were treated with a

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus twelve days before MCAO was performed. Our data showed that knocking down the expression of

Celsr1

in the SVZ increased the infarct volume, the percentage of apoptotic cells, motor function and the mortality rate. However, knocking down the expression of

Celsr1

in the DG did not affect the above indexes. The neuroprotective effect of CELSR1 on cerebral ischemia injury in MCAO rats was found for the first time.

A major observation of this study was that CELSR1 promoted neurogenesis and angiogenesis in MCAO rats. The mRNA expression of

Celsr1

has been reported to be primarily confined to areas of NSCs proliferation, including the ventricular zones during brain development, the telencephalic ependymal zone, and the subgranular layer of dentate gyrus in the adult brain [

11

]. CELSR1 can regulate the direction of dendrite initiation sites of newborn granule cells during adult hippocampal neurogenesis [

17

]. Loss of function of

Celsr1

in mice results in neural progenitor fate decision defects, cortical hypoplasia and behavioral impairment [

18

]. CELSR1 plays an important regulatory role in the nervous system. The SVZ of the lateral ventricle and the SGZ of the hippocampal DG are two areas in which neurogenesis occurs in the mammalian adult [

25

,

26

]. In an MCAO model, ischemic injury can promote neurogenesis in the SVZ and SGZ [

27

,

28

,

29

]. NSCs in the SVZ can migrate to infarct-damaged areas and become newborn neurons to repair the neural circuit [

30

,

31

,

32

,

33

]. NSCs in the SGZ can migrate to the granular cell layer and become new neurons to reverse the learning and memory dysfunction induced by ischemia [

34

].

Celsr1

knockdown in the SVZ or DG by shRNA lentivirus inhibited neurogenesis in MCAO rats. In human aortic endothelial cells, CELSR1 promotes cell proliferation and migration, and the formation of capillary-like structures [

19

]. Angiogenesis in the peri-infarct area is very important for the recovery of cerebral ischemia.

Celsr1

knockdown in the SVZ but not the DG inhibited angiogenesis.

Celsr1

knockdown in the DG did not affect angiogenesis and had no significant neuroprotective effect in MCAO rats. The reason may be that NSCs in the DG are unable to migrate to the cerebral ischemic damage areas near the cortex and striatum.

In addition to canonical Wnt signaling, noncanonical Wnt/ PCP signaling has an important regulatory role in neurogenesis, angiogenesis and cell apoptosis [

17

,

24

]. The Wnt/PKC, Wnt/JNK and Wnt/ROCK pathways are downstream pathways that are noncanonical [

35

,

36

,

37

]. CELSR1 is a core protein of the Wnt/PCP pathway. Thus far, the role of CELSR1 in ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury has not been reported. To explore the mechanism by which CELSR1 regulates neurogenesis and angiogenesis in MCAO rats, the phosphorylation levels of JNK, PKC and β-catenin were measured in SVZ and ischemic penumbra. Only the expression level of phosphorylated PKC was significantly reduced when

Celsr1

was knocked down. Based on our present study, it seems that CELSR1 regulates neurogenesis and angiogenesis in ischemia/reperfusion injury through the Wnt/PKC pathway, but not the Wnt/JNK pathway or canonical Wnt signaling.

In conclusion, this is the first report to explore the neuroprotective effect of CELSR1 on cerebral ischemia by lentiviral knockdown in MCAO rats. First, CELSR1 in the SVZ was shown to reduce neuronal apoptosis, the infarct volume and the mortality rate and restore motor function. Furthermore, neurogenesis in the SVZ and DG and angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra were promoted by CELSR1, mainly through the Wnt/PKC pathway. These data demonstrate that CELSR1 plays a critical role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, which provides a potential target for the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia. In this study, we verified that loss of CELSR1 protein can aggravate brain injury in rat MCAO models, but due to the limitations of lentivirus, we did not positively verify the role of CELSR1 protein (overexpression of

Celsr1

) in cerebral ischemic injury. Moreover, the study of the downstream pathways affected by CELSR1 protein is too simple, and there is no detailed study of a series of protein changes downstream of PKC. Our next work will focus on these two aspects.

4. Materials and Methods

4.1. Experimental Model

Healthy 2-month-old adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 270–300 g were obtained from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and used for this study. The temperature of the feeding environment was controlled at 22 °C ± 2 °C, and the rats were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experiments of Medical School of Shandong University (No. LL-201702002, 20 May 2017).

4.2. Intracerebral Microinjection

After anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate, each rat was placed into a stereotaxic frame. The head was further stabilized in a customized head mold. The right lateral ventricle was targeted at the following coordinates from bregma: −0.9 mm anterior, ±1.5 mm lateral and −3.6 mm deep. The DG of the hippocampus was targeted at the following coordinates from bregma: −3.72 mm anterior, ±2.2 mm lateral and −3.4 mm deep. The

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus and control lentivirus used in this study, with titers ranging from 2 × 10

8

to 8 × 10

8

CFU/mL, were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Company (Shanghai, China). Two microliters of lentivirus was injected at a rate of 1 μL/min, and the needle was retained in place for 5 min following the injection. Twelve days after injection, the animals underwent MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h.

4.3. Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Occlusion Model

Rats were subjected to MCAO based on a published protocol [

38

]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate. The right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. A nylon filament (0.28 mm in diameter) with an expanded tip was gently advanced from the CCA into the lumen of the ICA. The tip of the filament was positioned at the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The right MCA was occluded with the filament for 2 h, and then the filament was withdrawn to allow 22 h of reperfusion. During recovery from the anesthesia, the animals were returned to their home cages.

4.4. Examination of Neurological Deficits

Behavioral assays were performed as previously described [

1

,

38

]. Scales from zero to four were used to assess the effects of MCAO on neurological behavior. After 22-h, 46-h or 70-h reperfusion, the rats were scored according to the guidelines.

4.5. Evaluation of Infarct Volume

Three days after MCAO, the infarct area was measured by 2% TTC (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) staining as previously described [

1

]. The infarct area of each slice was measured with NIH’s ImageJ software, version 1.46 (Bethesda, MA, USA), as previously described.

4.6. BrdU Labeling

After MCAO 72 h, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma). The rats were perfused 2 h after the injection (SVZ: Con-shRNA group, n = 5;

Celsr1

-shRNA group, n = 4; DG: n = 3 in each group). Rats were transcardially perfused with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

4.7. Immunohistochemistry

Serial sagittal or coronal (40 µm) sections were cut with a cryostat and stored at −80 °C. For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-CD31 (1:50; Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL, USA), sheep monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and rabbit monoclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The nuclei of the cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

4.8. Western Blot Analysis

Three days after MCAO in rats, tissues from the SVZ and ischemic penumbra were harvested. The tissues were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor and 1% phosphatase inhibitor followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked and incubated with an appropriate primary antibody and secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-GAPDH (1:5,000, CST, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-PKC (1:500, Wanleibio, Shen Yang, China), rabbit anti-JNK (1:500, Wanleibio, Shen Yang, China), rabbit anti-β-catenin (1:10,000, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL, USA), rabbit anti-p-PKC (1:10,00, CST, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-p-JNK (1:500, Wanleibio, Shen Yang, China), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

4.9. Quantitative RT-PCR

Tissues from different areas of the brain were harvested from the MCAO group and the sham operation group. TRIzol was used to extract total RNA, and the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR in the presence of oligonucleotide primer pairs designed to target

Celsr1

cDNA and β-actin. The primers used for PCR were as follows: β-actin fo: gag agg gaa atc gtg cgt gac, re: cat acc cag gaa gga agg ct;

Celsr1

fo: gcc agt ttg ctg ttg ctc, re: gac agg ctt gct tcg ttc. The PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 °C, 39 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min and maintenance at 4 °C.

4.10. TUNEL Staining

Three days after MCAO, brains were serially sliced in coronal sections at a thickness of 40 μm with a cryostat. The sections were assessed by TUNEL assay. The kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), and the experiment was conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

4.11. Cell Transfection

HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO

2

for 24 h. Then, the old culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 4 μL of

Celsr1

-shRNA lentivirus with GFP. After 48 h of viral infection, the cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted.

4.12. Statistical Analysis

The results are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis of differences was conducted using Student’s

t

-tests. A statistically significant difference was set at

p

< 0.05.

5. Conclusions

CELSR1 has neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the protective mechanism of CELSR1 seems mainly through the Wnt/PKC pathway. These findings suggest that CELSR1 may be a potential target for the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia.

INTRODUCTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and one of the most evolutionarily diverse membrane protein superfamilies.

1

GPCRs direct multitudes of fundamental biological processes by linking extracellular stimuli to intracellular responses. Adhesion GPCRs (aGPCRs) are a large GPCR class, with 33 members in humans, yet their biological functions and signal transduction mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

2

–

5

A major obstacle is the lack of a universal understanding of how the aGPCR class is agonized and how they control signaling cascades.

6

,

7

Virtually all aGPCRs have a GAIN (GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing) domain, which harbors a GPS (GPCR proteolysis site) capable of autoproteolysis, thereby generating an extracellular N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a 7-transmembrane C-terminal fragment (CTF).

8

The most extensively studied activation mechanisms for aGPCRs involve removal or non-covalent attachment of their NTF following autoproteolysis, allowing a membrane-proximal tethered agonist (TA) peptide, also known as the

Stachel

peptide, to agonize the GPCR.

9

,

10

How universal these TA exposure-dependent or -independent mechanisms of aGPCR activation are across all aGPCRs remains unclear.

Recent structural studies have defined the TA-mediated activation mechanism of several aGPCRs, including latrophilin-3 (LPHN3/ADGRL3), ADGRG1, ADGRG2, ADGRG4, ADGRG5, ADGRD1, and ADGRF1, thereby providing crucial insights into TA-dependent activation.

11

–

15

Many aGPCRs have displayed important TA-dependent functions, for example ADGRG6 and ADGRD1 in zebrafish.

16

Interestingly, cleavage-independent signaling modes and functions have been previously reported, including evidence for TA exposure in the absence of cleavage.

17

Certain aGPCRs may contain a cleavage-deficient GAIN domain, as previously shown for human BAI3 (brain angiogenesis inhibitor-3).

8

Moreover, ADGRG5 is not efficiently autoproteolyzed yet can still become activated via its TA.

18

GPS motif presence but not cleavage of

C. elegans

LAT-1 is essential for rescuing developmental deficits in lat-1 mutants.

19

An LPHN3 autoproteolysis mutant was capable of rescuing deficits in synapse formation in LPHN3-deficient neurons.

20

Autoproteolysis has been shown to be dispensable for ADGRD1 coupling to Gαs.

21

Autoproteolysis-independent G protein-mediated signaling has also been reported for GPR56/ADGRG1. Namely, synthetic ligands that bind to the extracellular region of ADGRG1 were capable of modulating signaling in ADGRG1 mutants that diminish autoproteolysis.

22

Also, an ADGRG1 mutant lacking a TA exhibited a subset of preserved signaling capabilities, while a BAI1 mutant lacking a TA displayed robust and fully preserved signaling capabilities.

23

Collectively, increasing evidence supports that several distinct modes of signaling including both cleavage-dependent and -independent paradigms exist for aGPCRs. How certain aGPCRs engage these distinct modes to orchestrate specific functions remains poorly understood.

aGPCRs have emerging roles in critical aspects of diverse biological processes. LPHNs and CELSRs (cadherin EGF LAG-repeat 7-transmembrane receptors) are aGPCRs conserved from invertebrate to vertebrates, suggesting that they underlie evolutionarily ancient functions.

24

,

25

The mammalian LPHNs (LPHN1–3/ADGRL1–3) and their extracellular interaction partners teneurins and FLRTs (fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins) function in synapse formation and circuit wiring specificity.

20

,

26

–

29

LPHNs have also displayed other important roles during early brain development, including neuronal migration.

30

As GPCRs, LPHNs and their invertebrate orthologs have been shown to interact with numerous G protein-dependent pathways.

C. elegans

LPHN ortholog LAT-1 has been shown to interact with a Gαs pathway,

31

while

Drosophila

LPHN ortholog CIRL (calcium-independent receptor for latrotoxin) interacts with a Gαi pathway.

32

In mammals, LPHN1 has displayed interaction with Gαs,

33

Gαi,

33

,

34

Gαo, and Gαq pathways.

35

LPHN2 is currently less examined but has exhibited coupling to Gαs

36

,

37

and Gα12/13

38

. LPHN3 has shown several G protein interactions, including Gαs,

39

Gαi,

,

34

,

39

Gαq,

,

40

and Gα12/13.

40

The G protein-dependent engagement mechanisms and signaling pathways of CELSRs remain unexplored despite their crucial roles in neurodevelopment, although a connection to the RhoA/ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase) pathway via the planar cell polarity pathway has been illustrated.

41

Functionally, initial studies found that the

Drosophila

CELSR ortholog starry night (Flamingo) was essential for tissue polarity via Frizzled.

42

–

44

Seminal neurobiological studies found that Flamingo mutants exhibited disruptions in

Drosophila

visual system topographic maps, suggesting a role in neuronal target selection during circuit assembly.

45

,

46

The single

C. elegans

CELSR ortholog Flamingo/cFMI-1 underlies a crucial role in axonal pathfinding and neuronal development.

47

,

48

cFMI-1 mutants exhibited substantial deficits in GABAergic motorneuron axonal pathfinding, synapse density, and accumulation of synaptic vesicles at non-synaptic regions.

49

cFMI genetically interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway for proper neurite targeting functions.

50

,

51

In the

Drosophila

nervous system, Flamingo/starry night functions in limiting dendrite extension and promoting axon extension from sensory and motor systems.

52

Important studies showed that

Drosophila

Flamingo functions as a short-range signal to influence growth cone choice of correct postsynaptic partners,

53

supporting a role in circuit wiring. Interestingly, the Flamingo mutant phenotype was partially rescued by a mutant lacking most of the Flamingo extracellular region, suggesting a critical role of the C-terminal 7-transmembrane GPCR.

54

Despite these important previous studies, the biological functions of mammalian CELSR1–3 and how they signal as aGPCRs remain unclear.

Here, we investigate autoproteolytic cleavage and G protein-coupling mechanisms of the aGPCRs CELSR1–3. We combine aGPCR protein engineering approaches to enable acute TA exposure

40

,

55

with a panel of BRET2 (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) sensors for the GPCR “transducerome” of 14 different Gαβγ combinations

56

to assess TA exposure-dependent and autoproteolysis-dependent modes of G protein coupling. Furthermore, we determined the differential spatial expression profiles of

Celsr1–3

during postnatal neural circuit assembly. Our results show that different CELSR isoforms induce G proteins in autoproteolysis-dependent or -independent manners and display partially non-overlapping spatial expression patterns during neurodevelopment. These studies reveal insights into how aGPCRs coordinate intracellular signal transduction.

RESULTS

Mammalian CELSR1–3 exhibit distinct autoproteolytic cleavage profiles

Efficient autoproteolysis in the GAIN domain of LPHNs and several other aGPCRs has been well established. However, it remains unclear if CELSRs display autoproteolysis. We first set out to assess the autoproteolytic cleavage events present in

Mus musculus

(

Mm

) full-length CELSR1–3. Multiple sequence alignments showed that

Mm

and

Homo sapiens

CELSR1 and CELSR3 display an unusual GAIN domain compared with other aGPCRs including LPHN1–3, with the catalytic threonine/serine cleavage residue that is part of the typical HL/T or HM/T (the slash denotes a cleavage site) auto-proteolysis sequence replaced with an alanine or glycine, respectively (

Figures 1A

and

1B

).

Mm

and

Homo sapiens

CELSR2 exhibit a GAIN containing the catalytic threonine. The ancestral CELSR ortholog in

C. elegans

(Flamingo/FMI-1) contains a glycine residue at the typical autoproteolytic catalytic region and is more comparable to mammalian CELSR3 (

Figure 1B

).

We began by cloning full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3, fusing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag to allow detection of the putative NTF and CTF, respectively (

Figure 1A

). We tested surface vs. total expression in HEK293T cells via immunocytochemistry and found that full-length tagged

Mm

CELSR1–3 were efficiently overexpressed and localized to the surface of HEK293T cells (

Figures 1C

and

1D

). While these high-magnification images comparing surface with total immunolabeling illustrate the cell surface localization of our tagged full-length constructs, low-magnification images show the distribution of intensities across the cell population (

Figures S1A

and

S1B

). We subsequently used these constructs to assay autoproteolytic cleavage of full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3.

We used our tagged full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3 constructs to monitor the putative NTF or CTF resulting from potential autoproteolytic cleavage via HA or FLAG immunoblotting, respectively (

Figures 1E

,

S1C

, and

S1D

). Our experiments included tagged human LPHN3, which is established to be effectively cleaved, as a positive control. When transfected into HEK293T cells, we observed HA and FLAG products corresponding to the predicted sizes of the cleaved NTF and CTF of CELSR2 (

Figures 1E

,

S1C

, and

S1D

). However, N- and C-terminal tagged products for CELSR1 and CELSR3 corresponded predominately to uncleaved, full-length receptors (

Figures 1E

,

S1C

, and

S1D

). Thus, consistent with predictions based on sequence alignments (

Figure 1B

), full-length

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient in their GAIN domain, while full-length CELSR2 displays autoproteolysis.

More extensive multiple sequence alignments of the GAIN region of numerous mammalian and non-mammalian CELSR1 orthologs revealed that the important catalytic autoproteolytic cleavage residue and/or activating phenylalanine important for autoproteolysis and TA-dependent activation have diverged in certain mammalian species (

Figure S2

). While many mammalian orthologs lack the typical threonine important for GAIN autoproteolysis (i.e., human, mouse, chimp, sheep, rat, and cow), other mammals, including cat and horse, contain this residue (

Figure S2A

). This suggests that some mammalian CELSR1 orthologs may have diverged to be cleavage deficient, while others may have preserved autoproteolytic cleavage activity. To examine this further, we generated a point mutation in full-length

Mm

CELSR1 to introduce this threonine (CELSR1 A2464T). Similar to our previous experiments, we fused an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag to probe for the potential NTF and CTF, respectively, and assessed surface vs. total cell staining. Mutant CELSR1 A2464T was expressed and localized to the surface of HEK293T cells comparable to wild type (WT) (

Figures S2B

–

S2F

). Interestingly, introduction of the threonine alone in the A2464T CELSR1 mutant failed to induce robust and efficient autoproteolysis compared with full-length WT

Mm

CELSR1, indicating that the determinants of autoproteolysis extend beyond this single residue (

Figure S2G

).

Residue T2357 is critical for

Mm

CELSR2 autoproteolysis

Autoproteolysis of

Mm

CELSR2 generates a putative TA peptide, similar to LPHNs. A predicted residue important for autoproteolytic cleavage of CELSR2 based on known cleaved aGPCRs and alignments in

Figure 1B

is T2357. To determine if this residue is involved, we mutated this threonine to generate two CELSR2 point mutants, T2357A and T2357G, and examined their expression and autoproteolytic cleavage compared with WT CELSR2 and empty vector (

Figures 2

and

S3

). Mutant T2357A and T2357G CELSR2 harbored an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag similar to our WT full-length construct. Tagged CELSR2 T2357A and CELSR2 T2357G were expressed on the surface of HEK293T cells at relative levels indistinguishable from WT CELSR2 (

Figures 2A

–

2C

and

S3

). We then tested these mutant CELSR2 forms in autoproteolysis assays and found that both point mutations diminished autoproteolytic cleavage of

Mm

CELSR2, resulting in predominately a single band via FLAG immunoblotting corresponding to the expected size of the full-length receptor (

Figure 2D

). Therefore,

Mm

CELSR2 requires residue T2357 for effective GAIN domain autoproteolysis.

Evaluation of aGPCR acute TA exposure-dependent and -independent G protein coupling

Our results support that full-length

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient in mammalian cells, while CELSR2 is efficiently cleaved (

Figures 1

and

2

). The differential mechanisms of cleavage-dependent and -independent aGPCR:G protein coupling and G protein pathways controlled by CELSRs remain unclear. To establish a system to evaluate acute TA-dependent G protein coupling of aGPCRs, we implemented recent advances allowing for acute, thrombin-mediated exposure of the aGPCR TA peptide.

40

We combined the thrombin-mediated acute TA exposure approach with BRET2 sensors (termed TRUPATH) that assay the “transducerome’ of 14 Gαβγ combinations (

Figures 3

and

S4

).

56

We validated this approach using LPHN3, as in previous studies.

40

We began by replacing the extracellular portion of

Mm

LPHN3 (NCBI:NM_001359828.1) that is N-terminal of the autoproteolytic cleavage site with PAR (N-terminal domain of protease-activated receptor) (

Figures 3A

and

3B

). This approach allows for overexpression of a TA-protected LPHN3, and subsequent thrombin-mediated cleavage and removal of PAR,

57

which thereby exposes the TA peptide (

Figure 3B

). Similar to Mathiasen et al.,

40

we fused the PAR sequence to LPHN3 so that thrombin-mediated cleavage in PAR at LDPR/SF would expose the critical activating phenylalanine in the endogenous LPHN3 TA, thereby generating a thrombin-exposed TA of N-SFAVLM ... -C (

Figure 3B

).

We validated this approach with the TRUPATH sensors for Gα13 (Gα13/Gβ3/Gγ9), which was previously shown to couple LPHN3 in a TA exposure-dependent manner,

40

and GαoB (GαoB/Gβ3/Gγ8) as a negative control. BRET2 experiments were conducted in G protein knockout (GKO) HEK293 cells to minimize interference with endogenous G proteins and our overexpressed receptors of interest (

Figure 3C

).

58

,

59

We transfected the same TRUPATH sensors in cells co-transfected with empty vector (EV) to control for non-specific effects of thrombin treatment. Consistent with previous studies,

40

we found thrombin dose-dependent PAR-LPHN3 coupling to Gα13. Importantly, no significant change in net BRET2 was observed in EV conditions treated with similar concentrations of thrombin, supporting that Gα13 coupling was specific for thrombin-mediated cleavage of LPHN3 (

Figure 3C

). Thus, combining the PAR-LPHN3 approach with TRUPATH sensors provides a system to assess TA-dependent G protein coupling in aGPCRs.

Multiple putative transcript variants are present in public databases for

Mm

LPHN3 in intracellular loop 3 (ICL3), which is important for G protein coupling, as well as the C-terminal intracellular tail sequence, which has been shown to modulate signal transduction pathway specificity for LPHN1.

Next, we tested how three putative LPHN3 sequence variants (NCBI transcript variant 5 NM_0013 47371.2, NCBI transcript variant 7 NM_001 359828.1, and NCBI transcript variant 9 NM_001359830.1; here referred to as LPHN3

tv

5, LPHN3

tv

7, and LPHN3

tv

9, respectively) impact G protein coupling (

Figures 3D

–

3L

). Given that several aGPCRs have shown TA exposure-dependent and -independent activity, and LPHN3 has been reported to exhibit both basal and agonist-dependent G protein coupling,

39

we examined basal vs. TA exposure-dependent G protein coupling in parallel. As an initial control to assess potential differences in expression levels of the three PAR-LPHN3 variants tested, we immunolabeled for overexpressed PAR-LPHN3 variants containing a C-terminal HA tag but observed no statistically significant differences (

Figures S4A

and

S4B

).

LPHN3

tv

5 exhibits a relatively short ICL3 followed by an intracellular C-terminal tail region with a PDZ-binding motif (

Figure 3D

). We found that PAR-LPHN3

tv

5 displayed modest basal GαsS coupling and more substantial basal Gα13 coupling in the absence of thrombin-mediated TA exposure (

Figure 3E

), as well as exposed TA-induced Gα13 coupling (

Figure 3F

). Further control experiments showed effective agonist-induced (10 μM isoproterenol) coupling of GαsS and GαsL to β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) (

Figure S4C

), as reported in the TRUPATH study.

56

PAR-LPHN3

tv

7, which contains a 9 amino acid insertion (NYEDNRPFI) in ICL3 compared with LPHN3

tv

5 (

Figure 3G

), also displayed modest basal and exposure-dependent G protein coupling (

Figures 3H

and

3I

). PAR-LPHN3

tv

9, which contains the same ICL3 as LPHN3

tv

7 but a short C-terminal intracellular tail (

Figure 3J

), displayed no detectable basal Gα coupling (

Figure 3K

) but did display robust TA-dependent Gα13 coupling (

Figure 3L

). To control for other possibilities, such as receptor-induced changes in the expression of TRUPATH sensors, we plotted the donor luminescence measurements from these experiments but found no significant differences between conditions for given sensors (

Figure S4D

). These experiments further validate these approaches and suggest that aGPCR transcript variants may impact G protein-coupling efficacy.

Given the importance of LPHNs in mechanisms of synapse formation and brain development, we subsequently conducted RNA

in situ

hybridizations with C-terminal variant-specific and pan-

Lphn3

probes at three time points during synaptogenesis. Interestingly, the C-terminal tail present in Lphn3

tv

5 and −7 harbors a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with postsynaptic SHANK proteins.

60

We co-labeled brain sections from postnatal day 5, 10, and 21 mice with a probe detecting all

Lphn3

transcript variants (pan-

Lphn3

) together with a probe specific for the C-terminal tail sequence present in Lphn3

tv5/−7

but not Lphn3

tv9

(Ct-

Lphn3

) (

Figures 4

and

S5

). Probes specific for pan-

Lphn3

as well as the Lphn3

tv5/−7

C-terminal intracellular tail were robustly detected throughout the developing mouse hippocampus (

Figure 4A

). We quantified the intensities of each probe relative to the area occupied by DAPI and found that Lphn3 expression increased during postnatal development, particularly in the CA1 (

Figures 4B

and

4C

) and CA3 (

Figures 4D

and

4E

) compared with the dentate gyrus (

Figures 4F

and

4G

). The pan-

Lphn3

and Ct-

Lphn3

probes did not completely co-localize in all hippocampal subregions analyzed (

Figure S5

). The small size of the ICL3 insert sequence precluded similar analyses with this sequence variant, and future studies are required to determine its significance

in vivo

. Altogether, these experiments support that

Lphn3

expression increases in the hippocampus during early postnatal development and that the large C-terminal tail harboring a PDZ-binding motif is highly prevalent during this developmental period.

Full-length CELSR1–3 engage in G protein coupling with GαsS

While autoproteolysis of

Mm

CELSR2 will produce a putative TA peptide, our results support that full-length

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient in mammalian cells. This indicates that autoproteolysis-independent modes of signaling may exist for

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3. To begin interrogating this, we applied the complete panel of TRUPATH BRET2 sensors to full-length CELSR1–3 to assess G protein coupling (

Figures 5

and

S6

). Given the basal Gα13 coupling we observed upon PAR-LPHN3

tv

5 overexpression, we utilized this as a control within these experiments. Full-length

Mm

CELSR1 displayed GαsS coupling (

Figure 5A

). Heatmaps illustrate that in these conditions, full-length CELSR1 coupled to GαsS within the panel of TRUPATH sensors (

Figure 5B

). We subsequently performed plasmid copy number titer experiments where we increased the amount of CELSR1 plasmid transfected together with a given amount of TRUPATH GαsS sensors (

Figure 5C

). These experiments demonstrated an increasing BRET2 response with increased CELSR1 plasmid copy number compared with EV transfected cells (

Figure 5C

). Interestingly, similar experiments with full-length

Mm

CELSR2 and CELSR3 also revealed GαsS coupling and plasmid copy-dependent GαsS coupling (

Figures 5D

–

5I

). Notably, while a direct comparison has caveats, CELSR2 induced a stronger plasmid copy-dependent GαsS response (

Figure 5F

) compared with CELSR1 (

Figure 5C

) or CELSR3 (

Figure 5I

). Similar to our LPHN3 BRET2 studies, we also analyzed the donor luminescence readings but found no differences between TRUPATH sensors for a given CELSR isoform (

Figures S6A

–

S6C

). Altogether, these results support that full-length cleavage-deficient

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3 and full-length cleaved CELSR2 engage in G protein coupling with GαsS.

Celsr1–3

are highly abundant during neural circuit assembly and display partially non-overlapping spatial expression patterns

Despite the fundamental importance of the invertebrate CELSR orthologs Flamingo/FMI-1/starry night in circuit assembly, the functions of mammalian CELSR1–3 remain unclear. Thus, we conducted spatial expression analysis of

Mm Celsr1–3

through the developing mouse brain to obtain insights into their

in vivo

roles (

Figures 6

and

S7

). Similar to our

Lphn3

studies, we performed RNA

in situ

hybridizations for

Celsr1–3

at postnatal days 5, 10, and 21, which is a major period of synaptogenesis in the mouse brain. Interestingly,

Celsr1–3

were present in partially non-overlapping spatial patterns during postnatal development, with persistent expression through postnatal day 21 (

Figures 6A

and

S7

). We quantified the intensity of each

Celsr

isoform relative to the area occupied by DAPI in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions.

Celsr2

and

Celsr3

were the predominant isoforms expressed and were largely restricted to the pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampal CA1/CA3 and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus (

Figures 6B

–

6G

).

Celsr1

was distinct compared with

Celsr2

and

Celsr3

.

Celsr1

was expressed in the hippocampal region at postnatal day 5 but became increasingly restricted to the granule layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus over development (

Figure 6

). While

Celsr1

was uniformly distributed throughout the dentate gyrus granule cell layer at postnatal day 5, it became selective for the subgranular zone, where cells responsible for adult neurogenesis reside, by postnatal day 21 (

Figures 6F

and

6G

). Thus, different

Celsr

isoforms display discrete spatial expression patterns, with

Celsr1

and

Celsr2/3

being particularly distinct.

We examined

Celsr2/3

spatial expression more globally by imaging

in situ

hybridizations from sagittal sections and found that

Celsr2

was broadly expressed, while

Celsr3

co-expressed with

Celsr2

in discrete areas including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum (

Figure S7

). To determine if

Celsr2/3

expression in hippocampal subregions was enriched in neurons of the pyramidal and granule cell layers, we conducted double immunohistochemistry (IHC)/RNA

in situ

hybridizations for the mature neuronal marker NeuN together with the RNA probes for

Celsr2/3

(

Figures 6H

and

6I

). These experiments revealed that

Celsr2/3

expression overlapped with NeuN in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (

Figures 6H

and

6I

). Altogether, these studies support that

Celsr1–3

display differential autoproteolysis as well as spatial expression patterns in the developing mouse brain.

Autoproteolysis in the context of full-length

Mm

CELSR2 is important for GαsS coupling

While full-length

Mm

CELSR2 exhibits GαsS coupling properties, CELSR2 autoproteolytic cleavage generates a TA peptide with potential TA exposure-dependent or -independent functions. To first address if autoproteolysis is important for CELSR2:GαsS coupling, we tested the ability of mutant T2357A CELSR2 to couple to GαsS (

Figure 7A

). We conducted similar plasmid copy-number-dependent GαsS coupling experiments as in

Figure 5

and found that the T2357A mutation significantly attenuated GαsS coupling compared with WT CELSR2 (

Figure 7A

). This supports that efficient

Mm

CELSR2 autoproteolysis enhances its GαsS coupling.

To examine this further, we generated a PAR-CELSR2 construct to allow for acute thrombin-mediated TA exposure (

Figures 7B

and

7C

). We designed PAR-CELSR2 in a similar manner to PAR-LPHN3 by fusing PAR to the CELSR2 CTF so that thrombin-mediated cleavage of PAR at LDPR/S (the slash denotes a cleavage site) would produce the following TA peptide: N-SFAVLM ... -C (

Figure 7B

). We subsequently examined G protein coupling of PAR-CELSR2, using PAR-LPHN3

tv

7 coupling to Gα13 as a control (

Figure 7C

). Surprisingly, acute CELSR2 TA exposure alone failed to induce G protein coupling including for GαsS or other G proteins (

Figure 7C

). While Gα12 exhibited modest changes following thrombin treatment, control experiments revealed that thrombin treatment alone in cells transfected with EV can induce the Gα12 TRUPATH BRET2 sensor (

Figure S8A

). As before, PAR-LPHN3

tv

7 displayed strong thrombin-induced Gα13 coupling in the same experiments. Since acute thrombin-mediated TA exposure in PAR-CELSR2 failed to induce G protein coupling in our BRET2 assay, we next tested for arrestin2/3 (Arr-2/3) induction following acute CELSR2 TA exposure using NanoBiT Arr-2/3 membrane recruitment assays (

Figures S8B

–

S8D

).

62

Acute CELSR2 TA exposure with the PAR approach also failed to induce Arr-2/3 recruitment (

Figures S8C

and

S8D

), supporting a lack of GPCR activation. Altogether, these results suggest that while autoproteolysis is critical for effective

Mm

CELSR2 G protein coupling, acute TA peptide exposure alone using the PAR approach is insufficient for G protein and/or Arr-2/3 induction.

Importantly, the PAR-aGPCR approach generates a “scarred” TA harboring a serine at the N terminus that is not present in the native TA. While this does not interfere with the LPHN3 TA function, it may impact the CELSR2 TA. Therefore, we utilized another acute TA exposure approach recently developed that generates a native exposed TA.

55

This approach is based on the entirely P′-substrate selectivity of enterokinase, which cleaves following DDDK/.

55

This system has been used to generate functional native exposed TAs for ADGRG6

55

and LPHN3.

61

We adopted this approach for CELSR2 by capping the native CELSR2 TA (N-TSFAVLM ... -C) with SNAP tag-linker-FLAG (

Figure 7D

). Enterokinase-mediated cleavage in FLAG following DDDK/ exposes the native CELSR2 TA. As a control, we also used a SNAP tag-linker-FLAG-LPHN3

tv

7 in parallel. Surface SNAP-tag labeling demonstrated that these fusions were effectively expressed on the cell surface and that enterokinase-cleavage diminished this surface signal, relative to a C-terminal HA tag (

Figures 7E

and

S8E

). We subsequently used this system for BRET2 G protein-coupling experiments, including enterokinase (EK)-treated cells transfected with EV and 10 nM ISO-treated cells expressing β2-AR as controls (

Figures 7F

and

7G

). As in Perry-Hauser et al.,

61

this approach effectively induced Gα13 coupling with LPHN3 (

Figure 7F

). However, consistent with our PAR-CELSR2 experiments (

Figures 7B

and

7C

), acute CELSR2 native TA exposure with this approach failed to induce GαsS coupling (

Figure 7G

).

These results support that CELSRs may display distinct G protein induction mechanisms compared with LPHN3. To investigate this further, we generated nine point mutations in residues within the CELSR1–3 TA peptide region (

Figure 7H

). In LPHNs, these residues have shown to be important for autoproteolysis and/or TA-mediated agonism.

8

,

61

As before, our CELSR1–3 mutations were generated in full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3 displaying N-terminal HA and C-terminal FLAG tags. We first assessed mutant receptor surface localization and autoproteolysis compared with WT forms (

Figure S9

). CELSR2 F2359A, L2362A, and M2363A mutations impaired autoproteolysis efficiency compared with WT CELSR2 (

Figures S9A

–

S9D

). CELSR1 C2466A, L2469A, and M2470A displayed surface levels and an autoproteolysis profile comparable to WT CELSR1 (

Figures S9E

,

S9F

,

S9I

, and

S9J

). The CELSR3 F2511A mutation significantly diminished surface expression and localization, while CELSR3 L2514A and M2515A were efficiently expressed on the cell surface and exhibited autoproteolysis comparable to WT CELSR3 (

Figures S9G

–

S9J

). We subsequently conducted GαsS coupling assays with the mutants that were effectively expressed on the cell surface (

Figures 7I

–

7K

). Interestingly, CELSR1 C2466A, L2469A, and M2470A all induced GαsS at a similar intensity to WT CELSR1 (

Figure 7I

). The three CELSR2 point mutations either abolished (F2359A) or significantly attenuated (L2362A and M2363A) GαsS induction (

Figure 7J

). However, interpretation of these results in confounded by the observation that these point mutations also impact CELSR2 autoproteolysis. CELSR3 L2514A induced GαsS coupling, while CELSR3 M2515A exhibited a slight reduction in GαsS induction intensity (

Figure 7K

). Collectively, these results support that these residues are not essential for CELSR1 or CELSR3 GαsS coupling, while CELSR2 requires autoproteolysis in the context of the full-length receptor for robust GαsS induction.

DISCUSSION

Despite the crucial roles of CELSRs in neurodevelopment, how they function as GPCRs remains unknown. Here, we examined aGPCR:G protein induction principles by focusing on mammalian CELSR1–3 and LPHN3, which represent members of evolutionarily conserved aGPCR families shared across invertebrates to vertebrates. We first examined full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3 autoproteolysis in a heterologous system and found that CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient, while CELSR2 is cleaved with residue T2357, crucial for efficient autoproteolysis (

Figures 1

and

2

). We then used an approach to interrogate acute TA exposure-dependent and -independent aGPCR:G protein coupling, first validating this system using

Mm

LPHN3 (

Figure 3

). Next, we assessed Lphn3 expression together with one C-terminal tail variant in the developing hippocampus and determined that they were highly abundant during postnatal synaptogenesis (

Figure 4

). Applying the aGPCR:G protein-coupling system to

Mm

CELSR1–3, we found that overexpression of full-length

Mm

CELSR1–3 was sufficient to induce G protein coupling, particularly with GαsS (

Figure 5

). We then found that

Mm

Celsr1–3 exhibited distinct, non-overlapping spatial expression profiles during neural circuit assembly (

Figure 6

). Mechanistically, CELSR2 autoproteolysis was important for effective GαsS coupling, yet acute TA exposure alone was insufficient (

Figure 7

). Also, mutations in the CELSR1 and CELSR3 TA peptide region failed to block GαsS coupling (

Figures 7H

–

7K

). Collectively, these results reveal insights into how CELSRs function as aGPCRs and how aGPCRs mediate G protein coupling.

Our study has several inherent limitations that require future experiments to address. First, while even high immunoblot exposures support that the majority of full-length CELSR1 and CELSR3 are uncleaved in our experiments, consistent with their atypical autoproteolysis regions (

Figure S1D

), we cannot exclude the possibility that a small amount of cleavage product is present. We employed a panel of 14 G protein BRET2 sensors to assess G protein coupling, but we did not examine CELSR downstream signal transduction pathways. Future studies using a range of approaches are required to define the downstream signaling cascades regulated by CELSR1–3

in vivo

. Moreover, while our studies focused on mammalian CELSRs, the autoproteolysis and G protein-signaling mechanisms of the invertebrate ortholog (cFMI/Flamingo/starry night) remain to be identified. Interestingly, alignments suggest that cFMI-1 may be cleavage deficient (

Figure 1B

), and thereby more comparable to

Mm

CELSR3, but further experiments are required to address this. The PAR/thrombin-mediated acute TA exposure approach also has certain limitations. The endogenous aGPCR TA peptide is protected within the GAIN domain and is surrounded by numerous hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The PAR-aGPCR fusions remove this molecular context and may alter the native TA conformation. However, our results show robust, thrombin-inducible Gα13 coupling to PAR-Lphn3 as in previous studies,

40

further supporting the validity and effectiveness of this approach for acute TA exposure. Development of approaches with enhanced specificity and temporal resolution for inducible TA peptide exposure, such as the EK cleavage strategy, benefit studies of aGPCR signal transduction.

Our results also prompt multiple new questions. We show in a heterologous system that

Mm

CELSR1/3 exhibit a cleavage-deficient GAIN, while CELSR2 is efficiently cleaved. However, full-length CELSR1–3 all engage GαsS, and effective CELSR2 coupling to GαsS requires autoproteolysis. Interestingly, while autoproteolysis is important for CELSR2:GαsS coupling, acute TA exposure alone using the PAR-CELSR2 or EK-CELSR2 approach is insufficient. This contrasts with LPHN3, where acute TA exposure effectively induces Gα13 coupling in the same experiments using the same approaches (

Figure 7

). This suggests that autoproteolysis is required in the context of the native protein for CELSR2. One possibility is that the extracellular region plays a crucial role in G protein-coupling induction and therefore acute TA exposure alone is insufficient. Indeed, previous models have been proposed where the extracellular region and 7-transmembrane region communicate, and conformational changes in the extracellular region may directly induce activation without TA exposure.

22

,

23

Autoproteolysis may be necessary for the conformational changes allowing communication of the CELSR2 extracellular region with the GPCR.

How do cleavage-deficient aGPCRs, such as CELSR1 and CELSR3, induce G protein coupling in the absence of robust autoproteolysis? A model involving the extracellular region may also help explain this. For CELSR1 and CELSR3, the membrane-proximal TA sequence may be still capable of communicating to the 7-transmembrane GPCR via the extracellular region, as shown for other aGPCRs.

17

,

18

Thus, certain aGPCRs (mouse/human CELSR1 and CELSR3) have acquired mutations over evolution rendering them cleavage deficient yet still capable of inducing G protein coupling. However, a typical TA-dependent mechanism is unlikely for

Mm

CELSR1 and CELSR3 given that mutations in residues important for TA-mediated agonism fail to block GαsS induction (

Figures 7H

–

7K

). Unfortunately, we were unable to unequivocally determine the contribution of these residues in CELSR2 toward autoproteolysis-dependent vs. TA-dependent GαsS induction given that point mutations at these sites reduced CELSR2 autoproteolysis (

Figures 7J

and

S9A

–

S9D

). Nonetheless, our studies support that cleavage-independent mechanisms and several modes of signal transduction exist for aGPCRs.

What are the biological roles of CELSR1–3 in the mammalian brain? Critical insights into

C. elegans

and

Drosophila

Flamingo/starry night function have been determined in invertebrate systems, and Flamingo has been associated with the planar cell polarity pathway in development.

41

–

53

These previous studies support that CELSRs play integral roles in circuit wiring and brain development. Intriguingly, important studies have shown that CELSR2 and CELSR3 modulate opposing roles in mammalian neurite development in cultured neurons.

63

Our studies support differential spatial expression patterns of

Celsr1–3

during neural circuit assembly (

Figure 6

). These results show that

Celsr2/3

are the predominant isoforms and are expressed in neurons through postnatal life, supporting a neuronal role of

Celsrs

during mammalian postnatal development.

Celsr2/3

also partially overlap in the hippocampus, and therefore we speculate that a cleaved (

Celsr2

) and a cleavage-deficient (

Celsr3

) isoform may have functions in the same cells. Cleavage-deficient

Celsr1

was restricted to early development and persisted in the region responsible for granule cell adult neurogenesis, suggesting a distinct biological role from

Celsr2/3

. Therefore,

Celsr1–3

likely have non-overlapping functions. Our studies elucidating CELSR1–3 autoproteolysis and G protein-coupling mechanisms provide a framework for future studies of CELSR function

in vivo

.

In summary, we investigated autoproteolytic cleavage and Gαs coupling mechanisms of vertebrate

Mm

CELSR1–3. We demonstrated that

Mm

CELSR1–3 display different autoproteolytic cleavage profiles and distinct autoproteolysis-dependent G protein induction paradigms. Thus, aGPCRs exhibit several modes of G protein engagement. Overall, these studies expand our current understanding of aGPCR molecular mechanisms and open avenues of future investigation into CELSR biological function.

Limitations of the study

Here, we utilized a heterologous system to examine full-length mouse CELSR1–3 autoproteolysis upon overexpression in HEK293T cells. We were unable to investigate native mouse CELSR1–3 autoproteolysis in brain tissue due to the lack of reliable antibodies together with lack of CELSR1–3 KO brain homogenate to serve as a control. Future studies are required to determine native CELSR1–3 autoproteolysis

in vivo

.

METHOD DETAILS

Plasmids

All full-length

CELSR1–3, PAR fusion, and SNAP-FLAG fusion overexpression cDNAs were encoded in the pEB Multi-Neo vector (Wako Chemicals, Japan). All PAR constructs contained an N-terminal fusion of the human thrombin receptor PAR1 signal peptide and PAR cleavage sequence N-MGPRRLLLVAACFSLCGPLLSARTRARRPESKATNATLDPRS-C. PAR-LPHN3 and PAR-CELSR constructs were designed according to Mathiasen et al., 2020. For PAR-LPHN3, the PAR sequence was fused immediately upstream of the tethered agonist sequence beginning at N-FAVLMAH ... -C. Thrombin-mediated cleavage of the PAR at N- … LDPR/S-C (/denotes cleavage site) exposes the following tethered agonist sequence (N-SFAVLMAH ... -C).

The following antibodies and reagents were used at the indicated concentrations for immunocytochemistry: anti-HA mouse (Covance Cat# MMS101R; 1:1,000), anti-HA rabbit (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat# 3724; 1:2,000), Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen Cat# A22287; 1:40 diluted in methanol), and corresponding fluorescently-conjugated goat secondary antibodies from Life Technologies (1:1,000). For autoproteolysis assays, anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to iFluor 488 (GenScript A01809) at 1:2,000 dilution, or anti-HA antibody conjugated to iFluor 647 (GenScript A01808) at 1:1,000 were used. For double IHC/RNA

in situ

experiments, anti-NeuN mouse (EMD Millipore #MAB377) was used at a 1:500 dilution and detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Biotium #20400–1mL) at 1:500 together with Opal 520 reagent at 1:1,000 (Akoya Biosciences #OP-001001).

BRET2 assays

HEK G protein K.O cells (Grundmann et al.,

Nature Commun

., 2018) were plated into 12-well plate at a density of 3–4 × 10

5

cells in 1 mL per well. HEK G K.O. media contained 1x DMEM (Gibco Cat# 11995065) plus 10% FBS (Gibco Cat#16000044), 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning Cat#MT30002Cl) with 1x MEM Non-essential Amino Acid (NeA) Solution (Sigma Cat# M7145). After 16–24 h, cells were co-transfected with receptor of interest and TRUPATH plasmids at 1:1:1:1 DNA ratio (receptor:Gα-R-Luc8:Gβ:Gγ-GFP2) via TransIT-2020 (Mirus Cat# MIR5400). Each condition required 97 μL of room temperature 1x Opti-MEM (Gibco Cat# 31985070), 1 μL each DNA plasmid at 1μg/μL concentration), and 3 μL of room temperature and gently-vortexed TransIT-2020 reagent. The TransIT-2020:DNA complexes mixture were gently mixed via pipetting 10 times and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before adding drop-wise in the well. The plate was rocked gently side to side and incubated at 37°C 24 h before harvesting. In each well, media was aspirated, and cells were washed with 1 mL warm PBS. Cells were detached with 300 μL warm Versene (Gibco Cat# 15040066) and incubated at 37°C for 5 min then resuspended via pipetting 10 times. Cells were plated in complete DMEM containing 1x NeA at 200 μL with a density of 30,000–50,000 cells per well in Matrigel-coated 96-well assay plate. Each experimental condition was plated into three separate wells within the 96-well assay plate. BRET2 assays were performed 48 h after transfection. In each well, media was aspirated and cells were incubated in 80 μL of 1x Hanks’ balanced Salt Solution (Gibco Cat# 14175095) with 20

Mm

HEPES (Sigma Cat# H3375, pH 7.4) and 10 μL 100 μm Coelenterazine-400a (NanoLight Technologies Cat# 340) diluted in PBS for 5 min before adding 10 μL of vehicle solution, isoproterenol agonist (Sigma #I6504), or Thrombin (Sigma Cat# T4648) at 100 U/mL concentration for a final concentration of 10 U/mL, or 10 μL of Thrombin vehicle, which is 0.1% BSA (Roche Cat# 10735086001) in PBS. After 10 min of incubation, BRET intensities were measured via BERTHOLD TriStar

2

LB 942 Multimode Reader with Deep Blue C filter (410nm) and GFP2 filter (515 nm). The BRET ratio was obtained by calculating the ratio of GFP2 signal to Deep Blue C signal per well. The BRET2 ratio of the three wells per condition were then averaged. Net BRET2 was subsequently calculated by subtracting the BRET2 ratio of cells expressing donor only (Gα-RLuc8) from the BRET2 ratio of each respective experimental condition. Net BRET2 differences were then compared as described in the Figures, by subtracting Net BRET2 ratios of induced (thrombin/isoproterenol) conditions from vehicle treated conditions, or conditions overexpressing indicated receptors compared to empty vector (EV). For plasmid copy-dependent BRET2 experiments, conditions were transfected in a 12-well plate format with the same total amount of plasmid DNA and varying copies of experimental plasmid, adjusted to the same total amount with empty vector (pEB-multi). For Enterokinase treatment BRET2 assays, GKO HEK293 cells were plated and transfected as above. On the day of the assay, media in each well was aspirated and cells were incubated in 80 μL of 1x Hanks’ balanced Salt Solution with 20 mM HEPES and 10 μL 100 μm Coelenterazine-400a diluted in PBS for 5 min before adding either 10 μL of 5.5 U of Enterokinase (New England Biolabs #P8070S) in PBS or 10 μL of vehicle PBS. After 15 min incubation, BRET2 intensities were measured as above.

Adhesion GPCR autoproteolysis assays

The autoproteolysis assay was performed similarly to previously described (Araç et al., 2012). HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco 11965118) + 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma F0926) at 37°C in a 5% CO

2

atmosphere. At 70% confluency, cells were transfected with 2 μg of either CELSR constructs or empty vector DNA in a 6-well plate (Fisher Scientific FB012927) using a 1:3 mixture of LipoD293 (SignaGen Laboratories SL100668). 48 h later, the cells were washed with 1 mL of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (Gibco 14190144) and the PBS was aspirated; dry adhered cells were placed at −80°C. Cells were thawed the following day and the following steps were performed at 4°C: cells were resuspended in a solution of PBS +0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma A3803) and centrifuged using a swinging-bucket rotor at 2,600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of solubilization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl

2

0.1mM EDTA, 2 mM CaCl

2

, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The resuspended cell pellet was incubated at 4°C with rotation for 30 min for solubilization. The solubilized cell pellet was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected as the solubilized cell lysate fraction. Cell lysates were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.45 μm pore nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad 1620251) using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 100 V in a transfer buffer of 24.9 mM Tris-HCl and 193 mM glycine with 20% (v/v) methanol. Either the Kaleidoscope (Bio-Rad 1610375) or the PageRuler Plus (Thermo 26619) protein standards were used. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 4% BSA in TBST (20 mM Tris Base pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). After blocking, membranes were incubated with either anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to iFluor 488 (GenScript A01809) at 1:2,000 dilution, or anti-HA antibody conjugated to iFluor 647 (GenScript A01808) at 1:1,000 dilution overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. The next day, membranes were washed 4 times with TBST for 5 min each at room temperature. The membranes were imaged at respective wavelengths using the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).

Tissue preparation and sectioning

Wild-type C57BL/6J (Jackson #000664) mice were taken from their home cages at postnatal day (P) 5, P10, and P21, and whole brain tissue was collected in the following manner. Brains were rapidly dissected following brief anesthesia with either ice (P5) or isoflurane (P10 and P21) and placed in a rectangular cryomold (Epredia Peel-a-way #18–30) which was flash-frozen in liquid N

2

for 15 s to allow for indirect exposure of the tissue with liquid N

2

. The brain was subsequently embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Fisher Healthcare, #4585) within a second cryomold using a bath of 2-methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, #M32631–46) equilibrated with dry ice. Once frozen, the blocks were stored at −80°C until cryosectioning.

The frozen blocks were removed from the −80°C freezer and allowed to sit in the cryostat (Leica CM 1950, #047742456) at −20°C for 1 h to equilibrate. The microtome blade for slicing (Sakura, #4689), forceps (Fine Science Tools), razor blade for block trimming, and paintbrushes for manipulating sections, and the antiroll plate (Leica, #14047742497) were also all placed in the cryostat and allowed to equilibrate. Tissue was sectioned at 15 μm and mounted directly onto room temperature Diamond White Glass microscope slides (Globe Scientific Inc., white frosted 25 × 75 × 1mm, charged +/+, #1358W). Once mounted, the slides were kept in the cryostat until all sectioning was complete. Sections were subsequently dried at −20°C for 1 h, then stored at −80°C.

Tissue Pre-Treatment: The RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent manual assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics #323100) was carried out using the Fresh Frozen sample preparation according to the manufacturer’s protocol as described below. The RNAscope Hydrogen Peroxide (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #322335) and RNAscope Protease IV (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #322336) reagents were set out on the benchtop to equilibrate to room temperature. Sections were removed from the −80°C freezer and placed immediately into ice-cold 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15714)/PBS (MP Biomedicals, 1 tab/100 mL, #2810306) within a glass slide holder (Epredia RA Lamb Glass Coplin Jar, Fisher #E94). Slides were incubated at 4°C for 15 min to fix the tissue and subsequently washed twice with 1x PBS. Slides were subsequently dehydrated in the following ethanol (Decon Laboratories, Inc., 200 proof, #2705HC) gradient: 50% EtOH/ddH

2

O for 5 min, 70% EtOH/ddH

2

O for 5 min, followed by two treatments with 100% EtOH (50 mL of each treatment). After the final 100% step, the slides were placed section side up on a paper towel and allowed to air dry for 5 min. Then a hydrophobic pen (IHC World, super pap pen, #SPR0905) was used to draw a barrier around each section, which dried at room temperature for 5 min. While the barriers were drying, the HybEZ Humidity Control Tray with lid (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #310012) was prepared. A sheet of HybEZ Humidifying Paper (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #310025) was placed on the bottom of the tray and sprayed with ddH

2

O until damp. The EZ-Batch Slide Holder (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #310017) was placed inside the humidity control tray and the slides were placed in the holder. Three drops of hydrogen peroxide were added to each section. The cover was placed over the humidity control tray and the slides were left to incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Once the incubation was complete, the slides were washed twice with ddH

2

O, removing excess liquid after each wash via a vacuum. Slides were reinserted into the slide holder and 4 drops of Protease IV were added to each section, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. While the slides were incubating the RNAscope Probes were prepared in the following manner. First the C2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics: Mm-Adgrl3-O2-C2 Mus musculus Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3 (Adgrl3) transcript variant 7 mRNA, #1046031-C2) and C3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Mm-Adgrl3-C3, #317481-C3) probes and 100 μL/sample of the RNAscope Probe Diluent (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #300041) were placed in a heat block (Thermo Scientific, #88870003) at 40°C for 10 min, and subsequently removed from the heat and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The probes were combined to form a probe mix consisting of 100 μL of probe diluent per section, and 2 μL each of the C2 and C3 probes per section, respectively. The HybEZ II Oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #321720) was then pre-warmed to 40°C. Once the Protease IV incubation was complete, the slides were washed twice with 1x PBS, placed back in the slide holder and humidity control tray and 100 μL of probe mix were added to each section. The tray was placed in the HybEZ Oven for 2 h at 40°C to hybridize the probes. While the incubation was occurring, the 1x RNAscope wash buffer solution (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #310091) and 5x Saline Sodium Citrate (SSC) buffer was prepared. The 20x SSC stock contained175.3 g of NaCl (Fisher Chemical, certified ACS, crystalline, #S271–1) and 88.2 g of sodium citrate (Fisher Chemical, dihydrate, granular, #S279–500) in ddH

2

O, pH 7.0. Following the 2-h period slides were washed twice with 1x RNAscope wash buffer and placed in 5x SSC buffer overnight at 4°C.

RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay: The following reagents were equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h: RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 AMP1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323101), RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 AMP2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323102), RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 AMP3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323103), RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 HRP C1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323104), RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 HRP C2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323105), RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 HRP C3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323106) and RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 HRP Blocker (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 323107). While this equilibration was occurring, the HybEZ Oven was equilibrated to 40°C. Slides were removed from 5x SSC and washed twice with RNAscope wash buffer. Three drops of the AMP1 were applied to each section and the humidity control tray was placed back in the oven where it incubated for 30 min at 40°C. Slides were subsequently washed twice with wash buffer and placed back in the slide holder and 3 drops of AMP2 were applied to each section and left to incubate in the oven at 40°C for 30 min. Slides were washed twice, and treated with 3 drops of AMP3 at 40°C for 15 min. While the AMP3 incubation was occurring, the dye solutions were prepared as follows. The green and red dyes were prepared at a concentration of 1:1000 by combining 1000 μL of TSA Buffer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 322809) with 1 μL of Opal 520 Reagent (in DMSO, Akoya Biosciences, OP-001001) and Opal 570 Reagent (in DMSO, Akoya Biosciences, OP-001003) respectively.

Once the 15-min AMP3 incubation was complete the slides were washed and inserted back into the slide holder, then 3 drops of HRPC1 were applied to each slide, and that was allowed to incubate for 15 min at 40°C. Once that was complete the slides were washed and put back into the slide holder and 3 drops of the HRP Blocker were added to each section. This was allowed to incubate for 15 min at 40°C. Slides were washed and 150 μL of the Opal 570 dye mix was added to each section. This was allowed to incubate at 40°C for 30 min. This process was then repeated for the C3 channel, which was treated with Opal 520 dye.

Counterstaining Mounting and Imaging: Four drops of RNAscope DAPI (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, #323108) were added to each section for the purpose of counterstaining and left to sit at room temperature for 30 s. The DAPI was gently tapped off the slide and 50 μL of Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, #P36930) was added inside the barrier but not directly touching the section, avoiding bubbles. A glass coverslip (Corning, 24 × 60 mm, #2975–246) was lowered onto the slide, slides were allowed to dry overnight in a dark slide box (Fisher Brand, #03–448-4) at 4°C before imaging. Slide boxes were stored in the cold room a 4°C for long term storage. Slides were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 Confocal Microscope within 1 week of RNAscope completion. Images were taken at 10x and 60x magnification.

Images were analyzed using NIS-Elements AR 5.41.02 software in the following manner. Using the Automated Measurements and Automated Measurements Results functions, thresholds were assigned to the 405, 488, 561, and 640 channels. This was done using the per channel mode and with the following parameters: (for 405) smooth, clean, separate, and fill holes off, and the size option selected with lower bound of 5 μm; (for 488, 561, and 640) smooth, clean, separate, and fill holes off, no size restrictions. Once the threshold had been set for each channel, the data were exported to excel using the software’s built in export feature. The sum intensity for all points for a given channel was found, along with the total pixel area occupied of each channel. Then the sum intensity of each channel was divided by the DAPI area for its respective image to produce a ratio of the sum intensity of the gene-of-interest to the area occupied by internal control DAPI. For each region and postnatal day, 5–10 separate images were analyzed and subsequently averaged to generate an ‘n’ value for each mouse. Three separate mice were analyzed for each postnatal age, and quantitative data depict the average values from three mice.

Slides were incubated at 4°C overnight in the humidity control tray. Post-primary Fixation and Protease Treatment: After incubation with the primary antibody, slides were washed three times with 1x-PBS-T at room temperature. Then slides were submerged in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, #65346–85) for 30 min at room temperature. Following that incubation, slides were washed four times with PBS-T. Slides were subsequently placed back into the humidity control tray, and 4 drops of Protease 4 were added and incubated for exactly 30 min at room temperature. After incubation the slides were washed three times with ddH

cells/well in 0.5 mL complete DMEM. After 16–24 h, cells were transfected with indicated experimental plasmid via TransIT-2020 (Mirus MIR5400) with a total of 0.5 μg DNA amount/condition/well. After 48-h post-transfection, cells were washed briefly once with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Science Cat# 15714)/4% sucrose/PBS for 20 min at 4°C, and washed 3 × 5 min in PBS. For surface receptor labeling of HA tag, samples were then transferred directly into blocking buffer (4% BSA (Sigma Cat# 10735086001)/3% goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch #005000121)/PBS). For total receptor labeling, samples were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at room temperature and then transferred to blocking buffer. Samples were incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h, and subsequently incubated with diluted primary HA tag antibody (anti-HA rabbit (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat# 3724; 1:2,000)) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed 3 × 5 min in PBS, incubated with diluted fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 Cat#A11032; 1:1,000) together with fluorescently-conjugated Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen Cat# A22287; 1:40 diluted in methanol) and DAPI (Sigma Cat# 10236276001; 1:1,000) in blocking buffer for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, and mounted on UltraClear microscope slides (Denville Scientific Cat# M1021) using 10 μL ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, #P36930) per coverslip. Imaging regions-of-interest were chosen at random. ‘Low-magnification’ images were collected with a 20x objective and ‘high-magnification’ images a 60x objective (see

Imaging

section for details).

Imaging

Images were acquired using a Nikon A1r resonant scanning Eclipse Ti2 HD25 confocal microscope with a 10x (Nikon #MRD00105, CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda, N.A. 0.45), 20x (Nikon #MRD00205, CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda, N.A. 0.75), and 60x (Nikon #MRD01605, CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda, N.A. 1.4) objectives, operated by NIS-Elements AR v4.5 acquisition software. Laser intensities and acquisition settings were established for individual channels and applied to entire experiments, and images were collected at the following resolution: 10x –1.73 μm/pixel, 20x - 0.62 μm/pixel, 60x - 0.29 μm/pixel. Image analysis was conducted using Nikon Elements, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop for Figure purposes. Brightness was adjusted uniformly across all pixels for a given experiment for Figure visualization purposes. Quantification of fluorescence intensities was conducted by imaging 3–5 image frames per biological replicate, which were averaged to generate a single biological replicate value. The averaged value for each replicate is depicted as open circles in each graph. Cells were selected at random while imaging surface and total receptor labeling in HEK293T cells.

Indirect arrestin assay

The indirect arrestin assay was performed using the NanoBiT membrane recruitment system reported in Spillman et al., 2020. HEK Arrestin 2/3 K.O cells (Alvarez-Curto et al., 2016) were plated into 12-well plate at a density of 3–4 × 10

cells in 1 mL per well in 1x DMEM (Gibco Cat# 11995065) plus 10% FBS (Gibco Cat# 16000044) and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning Cat# MT30002Cl). After 16–24 h, cells were co-transfected via TransIT-2020 with receptor of interest (0.3 μg/μL); membrane-anchored AG10-CAXX LargeBit (0.05 μg/μL) and β-Arrestin-SmallBit (0.05 μg/μL);

Mm

Grk2 (0.3 μg/μL), and empty vector pEB (0.3 μg/μL) for a total of 1 μg DNA per transfection condition. Each condition required 96 μL of room temperature 1x Opti-MEM (Gibco Cat# 31985070), 1 μL each DNA plasmid at specified concentrations), and 3 μL of room temperature and gently-vortexed TransIT-2020 reagent. The TransIT-2020:DNA complexes mixture were gently mixed via pipetting 10 times and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before adding drop-wise in the well. The plate was rocked gently side to side and incubated at 37°C 24 h before harvesting. In each well, media was aspirated, and cells were washed with 1 mL warm PBS. Cells were detached with 300 μL warm Versene (Gibco Cat# 15040066) and incubated at 37°C for 7 min then resuspended via pipetting 10 times. Cells were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, spun down at 500xg for 5 min, resuspended in 1.5 mL blank 1x DMEM after supernatant were removed, and plated at 70 μL per well in Matrigel-coated 96-well assay plate. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were treated with 20 μL 1x Nano-Glo Live Cell Substrate (Promega Cat# N2011) diluted in PBS and Arrestin assays were performed. Total luminescence of cells was measured for 0.5 s/well in repeated manner at 42 s cycle length for a total 1 h. Ten μL of ligand (10

Introduction

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most severe and common of all human birth defects. The most frequent types of NTDs are spina bifida and anencephaly. The etiology of NTDs is complex and involves both environmental and genetic factors. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces 50% to 70% of newborn NTDs

[1]

; however, the mechanisms underlying this protective effect remain unclear. In terms of genetic underpinnings, monozygotic twinning and single gene disorders have long been associated with increased risks of NTDs

[2]

. Numerous exploratory candidate gene studies have highlighted a variety of biological pathways such as the folate and one carbon metabolism and transport

[3]

, DNA repair

[4]

, retinoic acid receptors

[5]

, and the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling network

[6]

.

The PCP pathway controls the polarity of cells within the plane of epithelium in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The PCP genes, including

CELSR1 is well known for regulating the establishment and maintenance of planar cell polarity. During mitosis, CELSR1 recruits VANGL2 and FZD6 to endosomes. Following mitosis, CELSR1, VANGL2 and FZD6 are recycled to the cell surface to re-establish cell polarity

[16]

Drosophila

mutants exhibited craniorachischisis, the most severe form of NTDs

[18]

. In humans, functional

CELSR1

single nucletotide variants (SNVs) have been identified in fetuses with craniorachischisis, and predicted-to-be-deleterious

CELSR1

SNVs have been detected in a few cases with NTDs or caudal agenesis

[19]

,

[20]

. However, the contribution of

CELSR1

mutations in the etiology of spina bifida is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the

CELSR1

coding region sequence among a cohort of spina bifida infants born in California by Sanger sequencing. Further, we conducted

in vitro

functional analyses to validate the functional effect of the identified mutations.

Materials and Methods

Ethics statement

The approval process includes detailed review by the State of California Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (the primary IRB). All samples were obtained with approval from the State of California Health and Welfare Agency Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.

Human subjects

Data were obtained from a population-based case–control study conducted by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program (CBDMP). The CBDMP is an active, population-based surveillance system for collecting information on infants and fetuses with congenital malformations, which has been described elsewhere

[21]

. Included for study were 192 infants with isolated spina bifida and without other major birth defects (cases) and 190 non-malformed infants (controls). Cases randomly selected from all live born infants with spina bifida and a random sample of non-malformed infants were ascertained by the CBDMP corresponding to birth years 1983–1999. Among the 192 spina bifida cases, 82 are White NonHispanic, 54 are native US born Hispanics and 56 are foreign born Hispanics. Among the 190 controls, 81 are White NonHispanic, 54 are US born Hispanics and 55 are foreign born Hispanics. All of the 192 spina bifida included in this study are cases of myelomeningocele. The case and control infants were linked to their newborn screening bloodspots, which served as the source of the gDNA used in these studies. Bloodspots are collected on all newborns in California for genetic testing purposes by the State of California. The State retains the residual, unused portion of the bloodspot and makes these bloodspots available to approved researchers.

DNA sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and amplified using the GenomiPhi Kit (GE Healthcare). Coding exons and flanking exon-intron regions of the human

CELSR1

gene (NM_014246) were amplified by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) from the whole genome amplification (WGA) product. Primer sequences are available upon request. The PCR products were sequenced using the Prism Bigdye Terminator Kit (v3) on an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Both case and control samples were sequenced with either a specific forward or reverse primer. Sequencing results were analyzed using the Mutation Surveyor software V4.0.7 (Softgenetics, Stage College, PA). Detected mutations were subsequently confirmed by a second round of whole genome amplification, PCR and sequencing analysis. GenomiPhi Kit takes advantage of Phi29 DNA polymerase, which produces high fidelity during DNA replication due to its proofreading 3′–5′ exonuclease activity. The reported error rate of Phi29 is between 3×10

−6

[22]

to 5×10

−6

[23]

. The probability to generate the same artifact mutation in two rounds of WGA is 9×10

−12

to 2.5×10

−11

. In our CELSR1 mutation screen, we sequenced 192 spina bifida cases with 9045 nucleotides in the,

CELSR1

(NM_014246) gene. In total, we screened 1.74×10

6

base pairs. The probability to detect the same coding region artifact mutation in our study is less than 4.35×10

.

Plasmids

Mouse

Ceslr1

cDNA cloned into a pEGFP-N1 plasmid (pEGFPN1-Celsr1) was kindly provided to us by Dr. Elaine Fuchs (The Rockefeller University, New York, USA).

Celsr1

open reading frame (ORF) was sub-cloned to pEGFP-C1. Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tagged

VANLG2

(HA-VANGL2) plasmid was obtained from Dr. Hongyan Wang (Fudan University, Shanghai, China).

VANGL2

ORF was sub-cloned into the pDs-RedC1 at XhoI and SalI restriction sites.

CELSR1

nonsense and missense changes were introduced into pEGFPN1-Celsr1 by QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kits (Agilent Technologies, Inc.CA,USA). All plasmids were validated by sequencing analyses.

Subcellular localization

MDCK II cells were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and cultured according to the manufacturer's protocols. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in 4 chamber 35 mm glass bottom dishes (4×104/chamber) (In Vitro Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). Plasmids transfection was performed using GeneTran III Tranfection Reagent (Biomiga, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's manual. Forty eight hours later, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated 5 minutes with Hochest 3342 (1 ug/ml) (Invitrogen), then washed 3 times with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 minutes at 37°C, followed by 3 times PBS wash. Cells were examined and photographed by an LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica).

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting

HEK293T cells were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on a 6-well plate at a concentration of 6×10

5

cell/well before the day of transfection. 2 µg of GFP-Celsr1 or its related mutant plasmids were co-transfected with 2 µg of HA-Vangl2 by Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 300 µl lysis buffer. Lysate was pretreated with protein A/G agarose, and then immunoprecipitated with 1–2 µg anti-HA antibody and protein A/G agarose at 4°C overnight. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot detection immunoblotting with the anti-GFP antibody.

Results

Novel rare mutations identified in

CELSR1

among spina bifida patients

The human

CELSR1

gene coding region sequence contains 46 TGTG and 3 TGTGTG dinucleotide repeats (

Figure S1

). Two TG dinucleotide repeat variants were identified in spina bifida cases (N = 192), and both of them were absent among the 190 control samples (

Table 1

and

Figure S2

). One was a TG-insertion (c.5050–5051insTG) and one was a TG-deletion (c.5719–5720delTG), both of which created a stop codon in the middle of the

CELSR1

ORF. The C.5050–5051insTG created a stop codon at the 1706

th

amino acid, and the C.5719–5720delTG produced a stop codon at the 1944

th

amino acid (

Figure 1

). We also identified 11 missense SNVs in NTD samples but not in any controls, six of which were predicted to be deleterious or damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen (

Table 1

). The six mutations are p.Arg2497Cys, p.Arg2354Cys, p.Gly1410Arg, p.Thr1362Met, p.Ile1124Met and p.Ala1023Gly. Four of the 6 SNVs were predicted to be damaging and disease causing by MutationTaster and FATHMM, they were p.Arg2497Cys, p.Thr1362Met, p.Ile1124Met and p.Ala1023Gly. These four mutations were mapped to different domains of CELSR1: p.Ala1023Gly and p.Ile1124 were mapped to the cadherin repeats, p.Thr1362Met was mapped to a EGF-like domain and p.Arg2497Cye was mapped to the transmembrane domain of CELSR1 (

Table 1

). Among these four mutations, one (p.Arg2497Cys) was identified once in the 1000 genome sequencing project. None of the 11 SNVs were previously detected in the Exome Variants Project (

Table 1

) or the two previously published NTDs' CELSR1 mutation screen studies

The

CELSR1

C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG disrupt CELSR1 membrane localization

Several point mutations (p.Ala773Val, p.Arg2438Gln, p,Ser2964Leu and p.Pro2983Ala) identified in humans craniorachischisis cases were found to alter membrane localization

[19]

. In our study, both the C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG variantsintroduced stop codons ahead of the CELSR1 transmembrane domain. Therefore, we predicted that these two variants would also impair CELSR1 membrane localization. In the CELSR1 subcellular localization assay, both the C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG misplaced CELSR1 in MDCK II cells. Unlike wild type CELSR1 which localizes almost exclusively on the cell membrane, CELSR1 protein with C.5050–5051insTG or C.5719–5720delTG distributed throughout the cells, including the cytoplasm and the nucleus (

Figure 2

) in all of the cells examined (100%).

Figure 2

Subcellular localization of GFP-Celsr1 wild type and TG repeat variants.

A: MDCK II cells were transfected with GFP-Celsr1 plasmids. Each image shown is representative of at least 50 examples. It demonstrated that the C.5719–5720delTG and the C.5050–5051insTG disrupt GFP- Celsr1 membrane localization. Scale bar, 25 µm. B: Western blot of GFP-Celsr1 wild type and the two indels mutants. It showed that the c.5719–5720delTG and the c.5050–5051insTG changed the size of GFP-Celsr1 protein.

The CELSR1 C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG disrupt VANGL2 cell-contacts localization

It was demonstrated that Celsr1 is required to recruit Vangl2 to sites of cell-cell contacts

[24]

. We subsequently studied whether the C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG affect the ability of CELSR1 to recruit VANGL2 to the cell-cell contact. MDCK II cells were transfected with PDS-RedC1-VANGL2 and GFP-CELSR1 wild type or its variants. CELSR1 and VANGL2 subcellular localization were examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in

Figure 3

, wild type CELSR1 co-localized with VANGL2 at the cell-cell contact in all of the cells examined (100%), while TG indelmutant forms of CELSR1 could not recruit VANGL2 to the contacting interface between co-transfected cells.

Figure 3

Subcellular localization of Celsr1 and VANGL2 in MDCK II cells.

A: The cells were transfected with GFP-Celsr1 or DsRed-VANGL2. GFP-Celsr1 itself was localized to cell membrane while DsRed-VANGL2 was unable to localize to cell membrane. B: The cells were co-transfected with dsRed-VANGL2 (Red) and GFP-Celsr1 wild type, C.5719–5720delTG, C.5050–5051insTG. In the presence of Celsr1WT–GFP, DsRed–Vangl2 changed its localization to cell–cell borders only when two Celsr1-expressing cells are in direct contact. Each image shown is representative of at least 30 examples. It demonstrated that CELSR1 C.5050–5051insTG and C.5719–5720delTG mutants failed to recruit DsRed-VANGL2 to cell-cell contact.

CELSR1 C.5050–5051insTG and C.5719–5720delTG impair interaction with VANGL2

We also tested whether the CELSR1 C.5050–5051insTG and the C.5719–5720delTG affect the interaction between CELSR1 and VANGL2. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HA-VANGL2 and either wild type or mutant GFP-CELSR1, incubated for 24 hrs and protein lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and western blot analysis. The expression levels of mutant and wild type GFP-CELSR1 were found to be similar. Co-IP assay demonstrated that C.5050–5051insTG and C.5719–5720delTG forms of CELSR1 impaired Celsr1 interaction with HA-VANGL2 (

Figure 4

).

Figure 4

Effect of TG repeat variants on Celsr1-VANGL2 interactions by Co-Ip.

Western blotting of the lysate with anti-GFP demonstrates the presence of wild-type GFP-Celsr1 protein and mutant proteins with different TG repeats. Following HA immunoprecipitation, blotting with anti-GFP confirmed physical association between Celsr1 wild type and VANGL2, while this association was affected in CELSR1 TG repeat variants.

Discussion

Our study identified novel

CELSR1

TG indels and SNV's in spina bifida patients. Two previous studies reported that rare mutations in

CELSR1

are associated with human NTDs

[19]

,

[20]

. Both previous studies identified only SNVs. One study investigated the biological effects of some other SNV's in detail, so our study focused on evaluating the biological effect of the observed TG repeat mutations.

Both the deletion and insertion were identified to be TG dinucleotide repeats. The insertion c.5050–5051insTG added a TG dinucleotide to TGTG, whereas c.5719–5720delTG removed a TG dinucleotide repeat from TGTGTG. It is known that among di-nucleotides, (TG)n are the most frequent in both humans and mice

[25]

. In humans,

CELSR1

coding sequence region (CDS) has 46 TGTG and 3 TGTGTG. In mice,

Celsr1

CDS region has 63 TGTG and 6 TGTGTG repeats. In this California spina bifida cohort, the

CELSR1

CDS TG dinucleotide repeat variation rate was 1% (2 in 192).

Previous studies showed that missense mutations in membrane associated PCP genes including

CELSR1

could affect PCP pathway signaling by disrupting membrane localization

[19]

. Here, micro insertions/deletions created truncated CELSR1 forms lacking the transmembrane domain, so that membrane localization might be prevented. Indeed, absence of mutant CELSR1 from the membrane and its accumulation in the cytoplasm and nuclear compartments was observed.

CELSR1 is known to physically associate with VANGL2, and CELSR1-VANGL2 interaction plays an important role in maintaining planar cell polarity during cell proliferation. During mitosis, CELSR1 interacts with VANGL2 and recruits VANGL2 to endosomes. Following mitosis, PCP proteins are recycled to the cell surface, where asymmetry is re-established by a process reliant on neighboring PCP

[16]

. Mutations affecting CELSR1-VANGL2 interactions can preclude VANGL2 recruitment to the endosomes during mitosis, thus disrupting PCP signaling. Both of the TG dinucleotide repeat variants identified in this study prevented Celsr1 physical association with VANGL2.

VANGL2 is another core PCP protein. It is a four-pass transmembrane protein and its proper localization is critical for VANGL2 function. Several proteins are required to establish VANGL2 localization. Previous studies demonstrated that NTD-inducing SNVs in

Vangl2

itself, such as p.D255E and p.S464N, could lead to mislocation of the protein in mice

[26]

,

[27]

. SEC24B is a transport protein involved in vesicle trafficking, including shaping of the vesicle, cargo selection and concentration. Mutations of SEC24B affected VANGL2 membrane localization

[28]

,

[29]

. Here, we demonstrated that truncation of CELSR1 can disrupt VANGL2 cell-cell contact localization. Our results are consistent with the findings in the previous study by Devenport and Fuchs (2008)

[24]

, which showed that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of GFP-Celsr1 partially impaired its localization to contacting interfaces and its ability to recruit Vangl2 at these cell-cell contacts. In our

in vivo

study, when GFP-Celsr1 wildtype was transfected alone, Celsr1 was distributed uniformly at membrane junctions (

Figure 3A

). When GFP-Celsr1 was co-transfected with DsRedC1-VANGL2, it was distributed asymmetrically to cell-cell contacts (

Figure 3B

). This observation is consistant with the Devenport and Fuchs (2008) study

[24]

, which indicated that Vangl2 and Celsr1 are dependent on one another for their proper asymmetric distribution.

In summary, our study on a California spina bifida cohort indicates that mutations in

CELSR1

contribute to the development of spina bifida. About 1% (2 in 192) of the spina bifida cases presented TG indels in

CELSR1

. It is interesting that the two TG indels identified in this study caused severe biological malfunction of the mutant CELSR1 proteins, yet the birth defect associated with them is myelomeningocele. In contrast, the study by Robinson and co-workers

[19]

found SNV's that moderately altered the biological function of the CELSR1 protein, yet the associated defect was craniorachischisis, a more severe type of NTD. One possible explanation is that NTDs are caused by a combination of multiple genetic and environment factors. One functional mutation is not sufficient to produce an NTD phenotype. There likely needs to be multiple functional mutations working together to cause an NTD phenotype, and to determine the NTD subtype. It was demonstrated in mice that homozygous PCP mutations caused craniochisichisis, as shown for Vangl2, Celsr1, and Ptk7 while double heterozygosity for a PCP mutation and non-PCP mutation can cause spina bifida, as shown for Vangl2/Dact1 double heterozygotes. Perhaps the CELSR1 TG indels combined with other non-PCP mutations caused the myelomeningoceles that we observed, and that in the Robinson's study, the moderate CELSR1 mutations combined with other functional PCP mutations resulted in craniorachischisis. In our study, none of the CELSR1 TG indels were combined with mutations in other sequenced PCP genes including VANGL1, VANGL2, DISHEVELLED1,DISHEVELLED2, DISHEVELLED3, FZD6, SCRIB and PTK7. Exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing approaches are warranted in order to examine the role of additional PCP genes such as

PRICKLE

,

ANKRD6

(ankyrin repeat domain 6; also known as

DIVERSIN

, the orthologue of

diego

),

FUZ

, and to detect non-PCP genes that may contribute to these NTD phenotypes.

The four SNVs, which were predicted to be damaging by the four computational programs used in this study, were mapped to three different domains of CELSR1. Two of them, p.Ala1023Gly and p.Ile1124Met were mapped to the eighth cadherin repeat domain of CELSR1, the same domain where two previously identified NTD mouse mutations (p.Asp1040Gly and p.Asp1110Lys) were located. These two SNVs may affect the function of cadherin repeat domain which plays an important role in cell-cell contact. Variant p.Thr1362Met was predicted to change a threonine amino acid to a methionine amino acid. Thr1362 is a putative phosphorylation site of both protein kinase B (PKB) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) based on analysis using KinasePhos 2.0 (

http://kinasephos2.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/

). Variant p.Arg2497Cys was mapped to the seven transmembrane domain. The amino acid characteristics change from arginine's basic to cysteine's hydroxyl may affect protein structure and CELSR1 membrane localization.

Combined with the SNVs, about 3% (6 in 192) of the spina bifida patients in our cohort possess

CELSR1

deleterious or predicted-to-be-deleterious variants. Our data provides further evidence emphasizing the contributions of PCP genes to the etiology of NTDs.

Introduction

22q13.3 deletion syndrome, also named as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, is a well-known syndrome characterized by typical clinical findings including neonatal hypotonia, absent or severely delayed speech, intellectual disability, and other various features, and detection of a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22q13.3 with the involvement of at least part of

SHANK3

.

[

1

]

It is reported that 10% to 29% of patients with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome present with lymphedema,

[

1

–

4

]

which is a recognized feature in many syndromes and can be caused by primary lymphatic dysplasia resulting from genetic defects.

[

5

]

However, the underlying molecular basis of lymphedema in 22q13.3 deletion syndrome remains to be explored.

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is characterized by hypoproteinemia due to the loss of protein in the gastrointestinal lumen. A variety of etiologies can lead to PLE, including intestinal lymphangiectasia and congenital malformations of lymphatics.

[

6

]

To date, PLE has not been reported in patients with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.

[

1

,

2

]

Here, we describe primary lymphedema accompanied with PLE in 1 Chinese girl with 22q13.3 deletion, in which

CELSR1

, a potential novel disease-causing gene of hereditary lymphedema was noted.

[

7

]

We speculate that

CELSR1

may be the genetic causative factor for primary lymphedema and PLE presented in 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.

Case presentation

2.1

Ethics statement

Written informed consent to participate was obtained from the parents of the patient. Genetic tests were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital (No. [2005]004).

2.2

Clinical features and investigations

The 20-year-old female patient presented to our institution for refractory hypoalbuminemia and chronic lymphedema in both legs. Lymphedema in her left lower extremity and right hand accompanied with developmental delay, absent speech, and diarrhea was noted at the age of 2 years. The biochemical test showed hypoalbuminemia. Low-fat diets and medium-chain triglycerides supplements helped alleviate the symptoms of diarrhea and lymphedema. Compression garment wear and limb elevation were suggested. After that, the symptom of diarrhea was resolved, but hypoalbuminemia persisted. Lower extremity lymphedema was gradually becoming severe. The patient needed regular albumin transfusion to alleviate hypoalbuminemia.

Upon physical examination, intellectual deficiency, the absence of speech, tooth grinding, dysmorphic face with prominent ears and wide nasal bridge, large and fleshy hands, dysplastic toenails, thick left leg with pitting edema (Fig.

1

A and B), and left lower lung dullness were noted.

Figure 1

The pedigree and clinical features of the proband. (A) The proband has normal parents and siblings. (B) The proband presents lymphedema in the thick left lower limb, dysmorphic face, large and fleshy hands, and dysplastic toenails.

Laboratory studies revealed lower lymphocyte percentage (16.5%), lower albumin (24.8 g/L) and immunoglobulin level (IgG 6.24 g/L, IgA 0.76 g/L, and IgM 0.49 g/L), normal auto-immunological test, elevated CA-125 (321.7 U/mL) and CYFRA21–1 (8.99 ng/mL) level, elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level (7.53 uIU/mL), normal thyroid hormone level, normal liver enzyme level, negative urine protein, and normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (137 mL/min/1.73 m

2

). The cardiac test showed a normal echocardiograph, long QT/QTc interval (430/451 ms), and incomplete right bundle branch block. Left pleural effusion, thickening of the small intestinal wall, mesenteric edema, and ascites were seen in the computed tomography scan (Fig.

2

A to C). Magnetic resonance showed lymphedema in the lower extremities. There were subcutaneous deposits of lymph and fibrosis of adipose tissue in the left leg (Fig.

2

D). Non-contrast magnetic resonance lymphography could not be performed because the patient could not follow instructions. Lymphangiography under general anesthesia was refused by the parents considering the risk of pulmonary infection. All related investigations did not suggest any renal, cardiac, or hepatic causes of edema and hypoalbuminemia.

Tc-labeled dextran lymphoscintigraphy and

99m

Tc-labeled human serum albumin (HSA) scintigraphy were performed in the proband.

A). Although fecal α-1 antitrypsin clearance determination was not performed, the diagnosis of PLE was rational. The photo from lymphoscintigraphy when the patient was a 2-year-old showed the absence of lymphatic drainage in the right upper limb and lymph nodes in the right axillae (Fig.

B). The other bipedal lymphoscintigraphy in the 20-year-old showed lymphedema, thickened left leg, the absence of lymphatic drainage routes in lower extremities, and lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa and above the bilateral inguinal ligaments (Fig.

Whole-exome sequencing and copy-number variation sequencing

Trio-based whole-exome sequencing (WES) and low coverage parallel copy-number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) were performed. No promising SNV or indel variants in known disease-causing genes recorded in OMIM stood out in WES analysis. Interestingly, some rare variants that did not conform to the law of Mendelian inheritance were noticed. Three rare variants

TRABD

:c.39C>A,

HDAC10

:c.880G>A, and

CELSR1

:c.7061G>A are homozygous, heterozygous, and wild type in the proband, father, and mother, respectively. All these 3 genes are located on 22q13.31-q13.33, which suggests the occurrence of maternal uniparental disomy or deletion of this segment. WES-based CNV analysis and further CNV-seq confirmed the maternal deletion in 22q13.31-q13.33 (chr22:46285592–51244566, hg19) (see Fig.

4

).

(chr22:46756731–46933067, hg19) is included by the deletion according to the data from DECIPHER. CNV-seq = copy-number variation sequencing.

SCO2

and

are autosomal dominant genetic diseases, while those disorders associated with the remaining 8 genes present with the autosomal recessive pattern. No rare deleterious variants in these 8 recessive genes were noted by re-analysis of WES data. Of 10 genes,

SHANK3

was the only one sensitive to gene dosage. According to the ACMG standards,

[

the deletion was classified as pathogenic with a score of 2.8 (≥0.99, pathogenic).

A gene list associated with PLE and primary lymphedema was built based on references from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, PubMed, and Web of knowledge (Table

1

). By comparing the 49 genes with our established gene list related to PLE and primary lymphedema,

CELSR1

was noticed (see Fig.

Discussion

As a recurrent microdeletion syndrome, 22q13.3 deletion syndrome has been well characterized and

SHANK3

has been designated as the key gene to elucidate the neurological symptoms like developmental delay and autistic-like behavior. Except for the neurological system, other systems including skin, endocrine, immune, urogenital, and lymphatic system are also involved in some patients,

[

1

,

4

]

which may attribute to different genomic content in the deletions. Our case manifested intellectual disability, absent speech, tooth grinding, dysmorphic face, and abnormal hands and toenails, which is consistent with the phenotype of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. Genetic analysis revealed a

de novo

heterozygous deletion in 22q13.3 encompassing 49 genes, inclusive of

SHANK3

. Given the consistent, well-defined phenotype and the pathogenic variation, the patient was genetically diagnosed with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.

Of note, progressive lymphedema complicated by PLE was the main complaint of the patient. Lymphoedema is reported in 10% to 29% of patients with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome

[

1

–

4

]

and it can be accompanied by chylous pleural and peritoneal fluids.

[

9

]

PLE has never been reported in 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.

It is known that PLE could be secondary to lymphatic abnormalities.

[

10

]

Generalized lymphatic dysplasia (MIM# 616843) and Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome (MIM # 235510, MIM # 616006, MIM # 618154) could present with lymphedema and intestinal lymphangiectasia. It is suspected that primary lymphedema and PLE in our patient shares the same genetic etiology of congenital dysplasia of lymphatics.

[

6

]

Gonzalez-Garay et al

[

11

]

reported that the proband with an early inactivating mutation in

CELSR1

displayed lymphatic backflow and tortuous lymphatic vessels, which indicates a valvular defect of lymph propulsion in collecting vessels. The deletion of

CLESR1

possibly results in valvular defects. Subsequent dysmotility or obstruction of the lymphatics in the thorax duct or intestinal lymphatic trunk leads to intestinal lymphangiectasia and PLE. It is a pity that lymphatic anomaly and dysfunction of the lymphatic flow were not demonstrated by lymphography. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia cannot be confirmed because of the lack of endoscopic and pathologic outcomes.

The underlying molecular basis of lymphedema in 22q13.3 deletion syndrome remains to be discovered. In our patient,

CELSR1

completely included in the deletion was identified as the potential cause of the primary lymphedema and PLE.

CELSR1

is located on 22q13.3 (chr22:46756731–46933067, hg19) with a size of 176 kb and consists of 35 exons. With a relatively low residual variation intolerance score of -2.82 (0.63%),

CELSR1

is predicted to be more intolerant to functional genetic variation and more likely to be a disease-causing gene.

[

12

]

It is also proposed to be intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) variation with the probability of being LoF intolerant score of 1,

[

13

]

while there is not sufficient evidence for haploinsufficiency with a haploinsufficiency score of 67.81%.

[

14

]

CELSR1

haploinsufficiency is reported to be associated with lymphoedema recently.

[

7

,

11

,

15

]

All reported patients from 7 pedigrees had LoF variants in

CELSR1

(p.(Glu290∗), p. (Asn681Metfs∗16), p.(I1708fs∗44), p. (Trp1957∗), c.5226+2T>A, c.5702–1G>C, c.6739+1G>A) and showed primary lymphedema in lower extremities without PLE. It was demonstrated that

CELSR1

influences vascular epithelial cell migration and proliferation,

[

16

]

and

Celsr1

together with

Vangl2

functions in lymphatic valve development.

[

17

]

All the above suggest that deletion of

CELSR1

may be causative for lymphedema in 2q13.3 deletion syndrome.

The distance between

CELSR1

and

SHANK3

is 4.18 Mb. We reanalyzed the data in Samogy-Costa paper

[2]

and found that of 34 patients with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, 15 (44.1%, 15/34) carry the deletion of

CELSR1

, while only 4 of them (4/15, 26.7%) reported lymphedema. The condition may result from incomplete penetrance. Erickson et al

[

7

]

found that the manifestation of lymphedema is limited in females in a family with

CELSR1

variant and proposed the possibility of sex-limited penetrance. However, male patients with

CELSR1

deletion and lymphoedema were recorded in Samogy-Costa study,

[2]

which conflicts with the sex-limited penetrance. We attribute the phenomena to incomplete penetrance.

In conclusion, primary lymphedema and PLE can occur in a patient with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome at the same time. The 2 phenotypes could share the same genetic etiology of congenital lymphatic abnormalities.

CELSR1

deletion may play a role in lymphatic dysplasia. The case also provides additional proof of the pathogenic effect of

CELSR1

on hereditary lymphedema.

#### CELSR1 - Article 5: Celsr1 and Celsr2 exhibit distinct adhesive interactions and contributions to planar cell polarity
<Date>: 2023-1-12
<PMCID>: 9878842
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptors (Celsr) are atypical cadherins that comprise a subgroup of the adhesion G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (

Langenhan et al., 2013

;

Krishnan et al., 2016

). They are distinguished by their large ectodomains consisting of N-terminal cadherin repeats that engage in homophilic adhesion (

Wang et al., 2014

;

Goffinet and Tissir, 2017

). Vertebrates have 3 Celsr genes,

Celsr1-3

, that are orthologous to

Drosophila Flamingo

(

Fmi, aka Starry night; Stan

), which is best known for its function in planar cell polarity (PCP), a molecular pathway through which cellular polarity coordinately aligns along an epithelial plane (

Boutin et al., 2012

;

Tissir and Goffinet, 2013

;

Goffinet and Tissir, 2017

).

Celsr

genes are crucial for embryonic development in vertebrates and their functions range from establishment of epithelial planar cell polarity to neural pathfinding and ciliogenesis (

Feng et al., 2012

;

Tissir and Goffinet, 2013

;

Goffinet and Tissir, 2017

). Mutations in mouse

Celsr1

, for example, cause severe defects in neural tube closure (

Curtin et al., 2003

), and

Celsr2

mutations cause defects in motile cilia formation leading to fatal hydrocephalus (

Tissir et al., 2010

). In humans, several Celsr1 variants associated with neural tube defects have been identified, implicating these proteins in human development and disease (

Allache et al., 2012

;

Robinson et al., 2012

;

Lei et al., 2014

;

Qiao et al., 2016

). The expansion of the Celsr subfamily in vertebrates has likely allowed each homolog to evolve different functions, but the overlapping and distinct functions of Celsr proteins are only partially known. Moreover, molecular details of Celsr regulation and function are lacking.

Celsr1-3 are very large (>300KD) proteins composed of nine extracellular cadherin repeats, a series of EGF and LamG repeats, a hormone receptor domain (HormD), a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain followed by seven transmembrane helices and a relatively long (∼300–600aa) cytoplasmic tail (

Figure 1A

)(

Wang et al., 2014

;

Goffinet and Tissir, 2017

). Despite their similar domain organization, mouse Celsr1-3 share only ∼35% amino acid identity.

Celsr1-3

transcripts are widely expressed in the nervous system and epithelial organs and are found in both overlapping and tissue-specific expression patterns (

Formstone and Little, 2001

;

Shima et al., 2002

;

Tissir et al., 2002

). Celsr1 and Celsr2 expression overlaps in many embryonic tissues including the brain, kidneys, lung, and olfactory epithelium, whereas Celsr3 is predominantly found in the nervous system (

Shima et al., 2002

;

Tissir et al., 2002

). Functionally, Celsr1 is essential for PCP establishment in several mouse epithelial tissues and is considered one of the “core” PCP components (

Curtin et al., 2003

;

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Ravni et al., 2009

;

Boutin et al., 2014

;

Shi et al., 2014

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). By contrast, Celsr2 and Celsr3 functions have been studied mainly in the nervous system where they have multiple roles in axon pathfinding and brain wiring (

Shima et al., 2004

;

Tissir et al., 2005

;

Shima et al., 2007

;

Zhou et al., 2008

;

Qu et al., 2010

;

Boutin et al., 2012

;

Chai et al., 2014

;

Qu et al., 2014

). Celsr2 and Celsr3 are also involved in biogenesis and planar polarization of motile cilia in ependymal cells (

Tissir et al., 2010

;

Boutin et al., 2014

), but it is unclear whether Celsr2 and Celsr3 function more broadly in the core PCP pathway outside the cerebral ventricles. In some contexts, such as in cilia biogenesis and axon extension, Celsr2 and Celsr3 are partially redundant (

Qu et al., 2010

;

Tissir et al., 2010

;

Qu et al., 2014

), whereas in other cases their functions are opposed (

Shima et al., 2007

). It is not known, however, to what extent Celsr2 or 3 act redundantly with Celsr1 in PCP.

Despite their critical roles in embryo morphogenesis and formation of the nervous system, the molecular details of Celsr function remain poorly understood. Aggregation experiments in non-adherent, cadherin-free cell lines (

Drosophila

S2, A431D, and/or K562 cells) have demonstrated that all three Celsr proteins mediate homophilic adhesion

via

their C-terminal cadherin repeats (

Shima et al., 2004

;

Shima et al., 2007

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Celsr2 and Celsr3 cadherin repeats activate Celsr-mediated responses in neurons, and homophilic Celsr1 adhesion supports stable junctional recruitment and PCP complex organization (

Shima et al., 2007

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Studies on Celsr1 suggest that, like the classical cadherins, Celsr cadherin repeat domains contain binding sites for both trans-adhesive and cis-clustering interactions (

Stahley et al., 2021

). Beyond their ability to mediate adhesion, which appears to be key for their function, much about the molecular interactions of Celsr proteins remains unknown. Furthermore, differences in adhesive interactions between the different Celsr proteins have not been rigorously tested.

The mouse epidermis is an ideal model for deciphering the relative contributions of Celsr proteins to PCP establishment. In the skin, the PCP pathway governs the polarization and alignment of body hairs across the skin surface (

Guo et al., 2004

;

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Ravni et al., 2009

). Core PCP proteins, including Celsr1, are expressed in epidermal basal cells, which are the progenitors that give rise to outer skin layers and hair follicles (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Basta et al., 2021

). Celsr1 localizes asymmetrically at the junctions of basal cells, where it forms homotypic adhesive interactions between anterior and posterior neighbors (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Celsr1 physically interacts with the other transmembrane PCP components, Fz6 and Vangl2, and promotes their assembly into heterotypic, intercellular complexes (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Much of what is currently understood about Celsr1 comes from studies of the

Crash

mutant (

Celsr1

Crsh

), which displays severe PCP-related defects including neural tube closure failure, misoriented stereocilia in the ear and misaligned hair follicles across the surface of the skin (

Curtin et al., 2003

;

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

). The

Crash

mutation maps to a single amino acid substitution (D1040G) in the ectodomain that disrupts the ability of Celsr1 to form stable, clustered assemblies

via

lateral

cis

-interactions (

Curtin et al., 2003

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). As a result, Celsr1 asymmetric localization and hair follicle polarity are disturbed (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). The D1040G mutation does not, however, reduce overall Celsr1 protein levels or its membrane enrichment, nor does it interfere with Fz6 or Vangl2 association (

Stahley et al., 2021

). Thus, despite its semidominant effects,

Crash

is a hypomorphic allele that impairs some but not all Celsr1 functions. How complete loss of Celsr1 function affects epidermal PCP establishment has not been explored in detail.

Compared with Celsr1, the roles of Celsr2 and Celsr3 in epidermal PCP and other skin functions remain largely unknown. Whereas Celsr2 is expressed in the skin epithelium both at embryonic and postnatal stages, Celsr3 transcripts are not detected (

Shima et al., 2002

;

Sennett et al., 2015

). For this reason, we set out to determine the consequences of removing all Celsr function in the skin by generating new CRISPR/Cas9-induced

Celsr1

,

Celsr2,

and

Celsr1,2

double knockout mice. Focusing specifically on the establishment of epidermal PCP in single and double

Celsr

loss-of-function mutants, we find that Celsr1 is the major Celsr family member involved in epidermal PCP. Celsr1 removal alone abolishes PCP protein asymmetry and hair follicle polarization, a dramatic phenotype that is among the most severe epidermal PCP defects that have been previously reported (

Cetera et al., 2017

). By contrast, asymmetric localization of PCP proteins and hair follicle alignment are mostly unaffected by the loss of Celsr2 alone, and removal of both Celsr proteins only minimally enhances the Celsr1 phenotype. To gain insights into the differences between Celsr1 and Celsr2 adhesive interactions, we performed a series of junctional recruitment and FRAP assays in cultured keratinocytes and found that whereas Celsr1 strongly and stably enriches at the junctional interface

via

homophilic adhesive interactions, Celsr2 is much less efficiently recruited to the junction where it is more mobile and diffusive. The two Celsr proteins are capable of interacting heterotypically in trans and are similar in their ability to recruit Fz6 and Vangl2 to junctions. Together, these data show that Celsr1 and Celsr2 display key differences in their ability to form stable, adhesive assemblies, which may underlie, in part, their divergent functions in mouse embryonic development.

Results

Generation of Celsr1 and Celsr2 knockout mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting

To generate deletion mutations in the

Celsr1

and

Celsr2

genes, we used a conventional CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting approach to induce double stranded breaks and indels in the

Celsr1

and

Celsr2

genomic loci. Guide RNAs were designed to target Cas9 to the genomic regions encoding the translational start sites and signal sequences of each Celsr gene (

Figures 1A,B

;

Supplementary Figure S1

). We reasoned that with this strategy, even if an alternative start codon were present, deletion of the signal sequence should prevent co-translational insertion of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum and result in a non-functional protein product. After screening and sequencing several different mutations that had undergone germ line transmission, two alleles were selected for propagation and backcrossed to establish heterozygous mouse lines.

Celsr1

<em1Ddev>

harbors an 81 base pair deletion that includes the translation start site and the first 17 codons of the 29 amino acid signal sequence (

Figure 1B

;

Supplementary Figure S1

).

Celsr2

<em1Ddev>

also harbors an 81 base pair deletion that includes the start codon and the first 9 codons of the signal sequence (

Figure 1B

;

Supplementary Figure S1

).

Celsr1

<em1Ddev>/<em1Ddev>

homozygotes (referred to as

Celsr1

−/−

hereafter) were recovered at Mendelian ratios but were smaller and weaker than their heterozygous and wild-type littermates. These animals also displayed curly tails, head shaking behaviors and whorled hair patterns with variable penetrance (

Figures 1C,D

). Homozygous

Celsr1

−/−

embryos displayed curly tails (

Figure 1E

) and on occasion, neural tube defects. These phenotypes are similar to those reported for a different Celsr1 null mutant and are consistent with defects in the PCP pathway in which Celsr1 is known to function (

Ravni et al., 2009

). Homozygous

Celsr2

<em1Ddev>

mutant animals (referred to as

Celsr2

−/−

hereafter) were both viable and fertile did not display any overt morphological defects at birth. However, many developed hydrocephalus postnatally (not shown), also in line with prior reports of a different Celsr2 allele (

Tissir et al., 2010

).

Using western blots with antibodies against Celsr1 we detected a ∼300KD protein band in epidermal lysates prepared from wild-type embryos (

Figure 1F

). This band was strongly diminished in lysates from

Celsr1

−/−

epidermis suggesting the Celsr1 protein either fails to be translated or is degraded. However, our ability to detect even wild-type Celsr1 by western blot was variable, and a faint band of similar size was still detectable in

Celsr1

−/−

lysates, so we turned to immunofluorescence to confirm the protein reduction in

Celsr1

−/−

mutants. In wild-type embryonic epidermis at E15.5, Celsr1 is expressed in the basal layer of the skin epithelium where it localizes asymmetrically to anterior-posterior junctions (

Figure 1H

). By contrast, Celsr1 immunofluorescence was strongly reduced in

Celsr1

−/−

embryos (

Figure 1I

) and what fluorescent signal remained was diffuse and unlocalized (

Figure 1H

), further suggesting

Celsr1

−/−

mutants do not make functional protein product.

Western blots with a Celsr2 antibody also detected a ∼300KD band in lysates from control epidermis, which was not present in lysates from homozygous

Celsr2

−/−

mice (

Figure 1G

). Given the genomic locations of the mutations together with phenotypic, western blotting and immunofluorescence data, we conclude that both

Celsr1

<em1Ddev>

and

Celsr2

<em1Ddev>

mutant alleles are likely to be protein null. Though we cannot rule out the possibility that cryptic start sites downstream of the

Celsr1

and

Celsr2

deletions may generate partial protein products, we predict these peptides would lack an N-terminal signal sequence and be targeted for degradation.

Celsr1, but not Celsr2, is required for hair follicle polarization

Correct anterior-posterior (A-P) orientation of mammalian hair follicles relies upon core PCP pathway function. Mutations in Fz6, Vangl2, and Celsr1 have all been previously shown to disrupt the asymmetric morphogenesis and coordinated alignment of hair follicles (

Guo et al., 2004

;

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Ravni et al., 2009

;

Chang et al., 2016

;

Cetera et al., 2017

). However, much of what we know about Celsr1 function in the skin comes from examination of the Celsr1

Crash

mutant, a point mutation that disrupts Celsr1 asymmetry, but does not reduce overall protein levels at epidermal cell junctions (

Stahley et al., 2021

). The

Celsr1

−/−

mouse model we have generated differs from the

Crash

mutant in that no Celsr1 protein is detectable at epidermal cell junctions (

Figure 1H

) allowing us to determine the phenotypic consequences of a Celsr1 loss-of-function mutant. To investigate this, we labeled E15.5 backskins with P-cadherin and Sox9 antibodies, which mark distinct populations of progenitor cells positioned on the anterior or the posterior of polarized hair follicles, respectively (

Figure 2A

)(

Cetera et al., 2018

). In agreement with previously reported follicle polarity defects observed with other Celsr1 alleles, hair follicle orientation in the

Celsr1

−/−

embryonic backskins was severely disrupted. Instead of polarizing along the A-P axis and growing toward the anterior, most hair follicles grew straight down, vertically into the dermis, clearly identifiable as a ‘bicycle wheel’ like ring of Sox9 expression surrounding a central cluster of P-cadherin expressing cells (

Figure 2B

). To quantify both the number and orientation of polarized hair follicles across entire backskins, we used an automated segmentation and follicle angle calculation algorithm, followed by

ad hoc

hand correction (see Methods). Whereas wild-type hair follicles were robustly polarized and grew in an anterior direction (

Figures 2E,H

), over 90% of hair follicles in the

Celsr1

−/−

embryonic backskins were unpolarized and displayed vertically-oriented growth. The few

Celsr1

−/−

follicles that did display PCad-Sox9 asymmetry were oriented randomly relative to the A-P axis (

Figures 2F,I

).

In contrast to Celsr1, little is known about the role of Celsr2 in the mammalian epidermis.

Celsr2

mRNA is expressed in both the epidermis and the placode (

Sennett et al., 2015

). As such, we next asked whether loss of Celsr2 affects hair follicle orientation in a similar way to Celsr1. Unlike in

Celsr1

−/−

embryos, hair follicles in

Celsr2

−/−

embryos displayed proper A-P orientation and were indistinguishable from wild type, suggesting that Celsr2 is dispensable for proper hair follicle orientation in mouse embryonic backskin (

Figures 2C,G,J

).

We next asked whether removal of Celsr2 would enhance the hair follicle phenotype observed in

Celsr1

−/−

embryos. To do so, we crossed the

Celsr1

−/+

and

Celsr2

−/−

mice to generate homozygous, double mutant embryos (

Celsr1

−/−

;

Celsr2

−/−

). Backskins from E15.5

Celsr1

−/−

;

Celsr2

−/−

embryos were then labeled with Sox9 and P-cadherin antibodies and hair follicle polarity was analyzed as above. The hair follicle phenotype of

Celsr1

−/−

;

Celsr2

−/−

embryos was indistinguishable from

Celsr1

−/−

embryos, further signifying that Celsr1, but not Celsr2 is required for proper hair follicle orientation (

Figures 2D,H,K

). We conclude from these data that Celsr1 is the major core PCP cadherin functioning in the epidermis.

Celsr1 and, to a lesser extent, Celsr2 are required for asymmetric localization of core PCP components

Hair follicle polarization relies upon the asymmetric distribution of core PCP proteins at the intercellular junctions of epidermal basal cells (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Cetera et al., 2017

;

Cetera et al., 2018

). Celsr1 localizes to the anterior and posterior junctions of each cell, where it colocalizes with Vangl2 and Fz6, respectively (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Basta et al., 2021

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Based on polarity analysis in the skin of Celsr1

Crash

mutant embryos, we know that PCP asymmetry relies on proper Celsr1 function. The Celsr1

Crash

mutant mouse (

Celsr1

Crsh

), harbors a single amino acid substitution (D1040G) that disrupts the ability of Celsr1 to form lateral

cis

-interactions and as a result, Celsr1 clustering, junctional stability and asymmetry are all impaired (

Stahley et al., 2021

). In

Drosophila

, Fz and Vang are lost from apical junctions in Fmi mutants suggesting that, in addition to promoting their asymmetric localization, Fmi recruits and/or stabilizes Fz and Vang at cell junctions (

Strutt, 2001

;

Bastock et al., 2003

;

Chen et al., 2008

). Whether Celsr proteins perform a similar function in mammals is unknown as this has not been tested in loss-of-function mutants.

To test whether Celsr1 and Celsr2 are required for the recruitment and/or polarization of core PCP components, we measured the orientation and magnitude (nematic order) of Celsr1, Fz6 and Vangl2 asymmetry along cell junctions. To do this, we imaged whole mount E15.5 backskins labeled with antibodies against Celsr1, Vangl2 and Fz6. Automated segmentation of epithelial edges was performed using E-Cadherin or P-Cadherin as a junctional marker (

Aigouy et al., 2016

). The nematic order of PCP protein fluorescent intensities was measured using QuantPolarity software and displayed on radial histograms (

Tan et al., 2021

). In wild-type control epidermis, Celsr1, Fz6 and Vangl2 were all enriched along A-P junctions and depleted from M-L junctions, and this asymmetry was highly aligned along the A-P axis (

Figures 3A–B’

). As expected from previous studies on

Celsr1

Crsh

mutant mice (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Stahley et al., 2021

), we found that PCP protein asymmetries were dramatically reduced in

Celsr1

−/−

mutants. Celsr1 immunofluorescence was strongly diminished at cell junctions (

Figure 3C

), and both Fz6 and Vangl2 were distributed more uniformly around the periphery of basal cells compared to controls (

Figures 3D–D’

). By contrast, the asymmetry of all three core PCP proteins was mostly unaffected in

Celsr2

−/−

mutants. Although Fz6 and Vangl2 localization appeared less sharply concentrated at junctions, quantification of asymmetry showed the magnitude and orientation of their polarity were comparable to wild-type controls (

Figures 3E–F’

), consistent with the normal alignment of hair follicles observed in

Celsr2

−/−

mutants (

Figure 2C

). Fz6 and Vangl2 asymmetries were more severely reduced in

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

double mutant embryos compared to

Celsr1

−/−

single mutants (

Figures 3H–H’

), suggesting that in the absence of Celsr1, Celsr2 does provide a modest contribution to PCP protein localization. Notably, despite the loss of Fz6 and Vangl2 polarization in

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

double mutants, we did not observe appreciable reduction in membrane recruitment of either Vangl2 or Fz6 (

Figures 3H–H’

). This suggests that unlike Fmi in

Drosophila

, Celsr proteins are not needed to traffic and/or retain Fz and Vangl to cell junctions, but rather to organize them into polarized junctional assemblies.

Differential stability of Celsr1 and Celsr2 homotypic adhesions at cell junctions

Our data thus far demonstrate that, despite their relatively similar levels and patterns of expression in the skin (

Sennett et al., 2015

; and Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/100057665; developingmouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/100055676) Celsr1 and Celsr2 contribute very differently to PCP function in the epidermis. Celsr1 plays a far more essential role whereas Celsr2 is largely dispensable. We hypothesized that perhaps the two epidermally-expressed Celsr proteins display different adhesive properties and/or abilities to interact with known PCP partners, which might explain their different contributions to PCP function. To explore this, we first compared the homophilic interactions of Celsr1 and Celsr2 in a junctional enrichment assay in cultured keratinocytes. Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP constructs were transiently transfected into primary mouse keratinocytes that were derived from the backskins of

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

double mutant embryos generated in this study so that the only functional Celsr proteins were the introduced GFP-tagged proteins. Adhesive monolayers were induced by increasing the calcium concentration in the media to allow for cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion. In this assay, Celsr1-GFP becomes selectively enriched at the interface between two Celsr1-GFP expressing cells in a calcium- and ectodomain-dependent manner indicating the enrichment is a result of cadherin-domain mediated homophilic interactions between Celsr1 proteins on adjacent cells (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

) (

Figure 4A

,

Supplementary Figure S4

). To measure the degree of enrichment, we calculated a junctional enrichment score (JE) for cell pairs expressing Celsr-GFP (ratio of the mean junctional intensity to the mean intensity of the cell pair) (

Figure 4B

). Membrane associated GFP-CAAX was used as a negative control for the baseline enrichment observed when membranes of adjacent cells overlap (JE

GFP−CAAX

< 2) (

Figures 4A,B

). As expected from prior studies, Celsr1 was strongly enriched at the junctional interfaces between expressing cells with an average enrichment score of approximately 4 (

Stahley et al., 2021

) (

Figures 4A,B

,

Supplementary Figure S4

). Celsr2-GFP localization, by contrast, was significantly more diffuse across cell pairs (

Figures 4A,B

,

Supplementary Figure S4

; mean JE

Celsr2−GFP

∼2.5) but was still enriched to a greater extent than the GFP-CAAX baseline (mean JE < 2) (

Figures 4A,B

). This indicates that Celsr2 does interact homophilically

in trans

in epithelial cells. This result is consistent with Celsr2’s ability to mediate aggregation in S2 cells (

Shima et al., 2004

). Interestingly, when cells transfected with Celsr1-3xFLAG were mixed with Celsr2-GFP expressing cells, they formed heterotypic junctions

in trans

between mixed cell pairs (

Figure 4E

). The enrichment of Celsr2-GFP with Celsr1-3xFLAG at Celsr1/2 heterotypic junctions was, however, lower than the enrichment of Celsr1-GFP with Celsr1-3xFLAG (

Figures 4E,F

). This observation indicates that despite the differences in Celsr1 and Celsr2 homotypic junctions, their ectodomains are similar enough to interact heterotypically.

The enrichment of cell-cell adhesion proteins to junctions correlates with their relative immobility within the interfacial membrane (

Stahley et al., 2021

). We have previously shown that Celsr1 is remarkably stable at cell junctions, where it is more immobile than junctional E-Cadherin (

Aw et al., 2016

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). To determine if the comparatively low enrichment of Celsr2 at homotypic interfaces is correlated with a greater mobility in the membrane, we performed FRAP assays in cell pairs expressing Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP. Small regions (1um diameter) along the junctions or free edges of Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP expressing cell pairs were photobleached and imaged continuously over a 4-min recovery period (

Figure 4C

,

Supplementary Figure S4

). Fluorescence recovery curves for Celsr1 and Celsr2 were nearly identical in regions near a free edge where the proteins are most likely unbound intercellularly and free to diffuse within the membrane (

Figure 4D

). By contrast, at junctions the extent of recovery for Celsr1 and Celsr2 were starkly different. Whereas Celsr1-GFP fluorescence was strongly immobilized (immobile fraction ∼80% at junctions

versus

∼26% at cell edges, estimated from fitted averaged traces) and recovered only minimally over the entire recovery period, the mobility of Celsr2-GFP was comparatively less attenuated at junctions (immobile fraction ∼43% at junctions

versus

∼28% at cell edges, estimated from fitted averaged traces) (

Figure 4D

). These data suggest that the adhesive interactions of Celsr proteins at epithelial junctions are not equivalent and that Celsr1 interactions lead to much greater stability and junctional enrichment.

Fz6 and Vangl2 are recruited to both Celsr1-and Celsr2-homotypic adhesions

One important function for Celsr1 and

Drosophila

Fmi in PCP establishment is to physically associate with the other transmembrane core components, Fz and Vang, stabilize them at cell junctions, and promote their assembly into asymmetric, intercellular complexes (

Harrison et al., 2020

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Additionally, in

Drosophila

, Fz and Vang positively feed back onto Fmi stability by preventing its endocytic removal from the membrane (

Strutt and Strutt, 2008

;

Strutt et al., 2011

). Thus, a difference in Fz and/or Vang association could explain why Celsr1 and Celsr2 display different junctional dynamics and contributions to PCP. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether Celsr2 can redirect Fz6 and Vangl2 to sites of homotypic adhesion in cultured keratinocytes, as a read-out of their association, as we have previously shown for Celsr1 (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Primary mouse keratinocytes derived from

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

double mutants were co-transfected with Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP and either Fz6-tdTomato or tdTomato-Vangl2 and a JE score was calculated for co-expressing cell pairs. tdTomato-CAAX was used as a negative control to establish the baseline JE score for a generic membrane marker. As expected, Fz6-tdTomato and tdTomato-Vangl2 were both recruited to sites of Celsr1-GFP localization and became strongly enriched at the junctional interface between co-expressing cell pairs (

Figures 5A,B,G,I

) (mean JE

tdT−Fz6

−.5 and mean JE

tdT−Vangl2

−4.5). Both proteins were significantly enriched compared to negative control tdTomato-CAAX (

Figures 5C,G,I

) (mean JE

tdT−CAAX

−2). Fz6-tdTomato and tdTomato-Vangl2 also localized to Celsr2-GFP enriched junctions (

Figures 5D,E,G,I

), and their JE scores were significantly greater than that of tdTomato-CAAX (

Figures 5F,G,I

), indicating that Celsr2 is capable of associating with Fz6 and Vangl2 and directing them to sites of homophilic adhesion. However, Fz6-tdTomato and tdTomato-Vangl2 enrichment was significantly lower than when they were co-expressed with Celsr1-GFP (

Figures 5G,I

). This difference is most likely due to the lower JE of Celsr2 itself when compared to Celsr1 within these same experiments (

Figures 4H–J

,

Supplementary Figure S5

) rather than a major difference in the ability of Celsr2 to associate with Fz6 and Vangl2. We conclude from these data that, like Celsr1, Celsr2 can recruit Fz6 and Vangl2 to sites of homophilic adhesion and, by extension, may possibly physically associate with both proteins.

Discussion

The Celsr subfamily of adhesion GPCRs are essential for embryonic development and formation of the nervous system, yet we are only just beginning to understand the range of functions that these very large adhesive molecules perform and how adhesion contributes to those functions (

Wang et al., 2014

;

Goffinet and Tissir, 2017

). Through the generation of new Celsr1 and Celsr2 knockout mouse strains and examination of both single and double mutant embryos, we have determined the contributions of Celsr proteins to embryonic skin development. Because Celsr3 is not expressed in the skin, our data allow us to confidently conclude that Celsr1 is the major cadherin-based adhesion GPCR functioning in epidermal PCP. Further, we can also conclude that the major function of Celsr proteins in skin development is to establish PCP. Other key developmental processes in the skin such as stratification, hair follicle specification, patterning, and downgrowth are largely unaffected when all Celsr function is removed. On a molecular level, we have identified key similarities and differences in the adhesive interactions and dynamics of Celsr1 and Celsr2 proteins at epithelial junctions. The adhesive interfaces of Celsr1 and Celsr2 are similar enough to engage heterotypically and both proteins can recruit Fz6 and Vangl2. Despite these similarities, their dynamics at homotypic adhesive interfaces are markedly different. Celsr1 is largely immobile at the junction whereas Celsr2 can diffuse much more freely. This difference is reflected in the relative enrichment of the two proteins at junctions.

In our prior work, we showed that Celsr1 is very stable at cell junctions, where it has a lower mobility than junctional E-Cadherin (

Aw et al., 2016

;

Stahley et al., 2021

). Celsr1’s immobility is in part due to clustering interactions that organize Celsr1 into large punctate assemblies, a property that is severely diminished by the

Crash

mutation located in the membrane proximal cadherin repeats. Although Celsr2 can mediate cell aggregation when expressed in non-adhesive suspension cells (

Shima et al., 2004

), it is poorly enriched at junctional interfaces in epithelial cells, and the fraction that is recruited to junctions exhibits greater mobility than Celsr1. Whether these adhesive differences can be attributed to differences in the sequence of their N-terminal cadherin repeats is unclear. Celsr1 and Celsr2 share 55% amino acid identity, but it is their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails, rather than their cadherin repeats, that are the most divergent in sequence. Interestingly the residue mutated in the

Crash

allele of Celsr1, D1040, which maps to the linker region between EC8 and EC9, is conserved in Celsr2, and yet the homophilic adhesive properties of Celsr2 much more closely mimic that of the

Celsr1

Crash

mutant than wild type Celsr1, suggesting this residue is necessary but not sufficient for Celsr1 stable association at cell junctions. Interestingly, Celsr1, Celsr2 and the Celsr1

Crash

mutant proteins are all capable of recruiting core PCP proteins Fz6 and Vangl2 to junctions (

Stahley et al., 2021

), suggesting it is not the presence of these additional PCP proteins at the junction that contributes to Celsr1 stability. Perhaps differences in the affinity of trans-adhesive interactions, in the avidity of cis-adhesive interactions, or in the identity of cytoplasmic binding partners may account for the different homophilic adhesive properties of the two Celsr proteins. Performing adhesion assays with domain swapped Celsr1-Celsr2 chimeric proteins will distinguish whether adhesive differences are due to extracellular, transmembrane or cytoplasmic regions. Although we do not know the molecular basis for these differences in mobility and enrichment, we propose that they have important functional consequences.

Differences in stability of Celsr1 and Celsr2 adhesions could enable the two proteins to perform distinct functions in dynamic

versus

static cellular contexts. Celsr1 is essential for PCP in the skin, inner ear, oviduct and ependymal cells, all of which are relatively static epithelial tissues that assemble robust, asymmetric PCP complexes at cell junctions (

Curtin et al., 2003

;

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

;

Boutin et al., 2014

;

Shi et al., 2014

;

Duncan et al., 2017

). The immobility of homophilic Celsr1 adhesions at these sites is probably essential for PCP asymmetry. In the

Drosophila

wing, PCP asymmetry is strongly correlated with the assembly of PCP components into stable puncta (

Strutt et al., 2011

;

Cho et al., 2015

;

Strutt et al., 2016

). Moreover, in mouse epidermal cells, disruption of Celsr1 lateral clustering interactions prevents the formation of asymmetric PCP complexes (

Stahley et al., 2021

). Celsr2, by contrast, is important in neuronal migration and axon pathfinding (

Shima et al., 2004

;

Shima et al., 2007

;

Qu et al., 2010

;

Feng et al., 2012

;

Qu et al., 2014

), processes that likely require adhesive interactions that can rapidly turnover, and Celsr2 may be better equipped than Celsr1 for such dynamics. Given that Celsr2 can recruit both Vangl2 and Fz6 to adhesive sites suggests it may form more dynamic PCP-like assemblies in neurons than those containing Celsr1 in epithelia. Interestingly, the single Celsr homolog in

Drosophila

, Fmi, functions in epithelial PCP as well as nervous system development, so it can most likely assemble both stable and dynamic adhesions in a cell type-specific manner (

Gao et al., 2000

;

Berger-Muller and Suzuki, 2011

;

Shimizu et al., 2011

). Perhaps different Fmi splice isoforms are expressed in different cell types, or that cell type specific interacting proteins regulate Fmi’s adhesive state.

Despite the similarity in protein domain organization across the 3 Celsrs, it remains unclear if Celsr2 (or Celsr3) can function as a core PCP component in vertebrates, defined in the strict sense of acting at cell junctions to align cell polarity across a tissue plane (

Devenport, 2014

). Given that Celsr2 exhibits mobility at the junction comparable to the

Crash

mutant of Celsr1, it is possible Celsr2 cannot asymmetrically localize to junctions in epithelia. Unfortunately, due to lack of antibodies that reliably detect endogenous Celsr2

in vivo

, we do not presently know the localization of Celsr2 in the mouse epidermis. Further, although endogenous levels of Celsr2 cannot replace Celsr1 in epidermal PCP, we do not know whether overexpression of Celsr2 could compensate. Additionally, given its roles in biogenesis and polarization of motile cilia in the brain (

Tissir et al., 2010

;

Boutin et al., 2014

), we were open to the possibility that Celsr2 might have a function related to primary cilia in the skin. However, we did not observe phenotypes associated with cilia disruption in the skin of either

Celsr2

−/−

or

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

double mutant embryos, such as defects in epidermal thickness due to impaired Notch signaling or defects in hair follicle morphogenesis related to aberrant Shh signaling (

Ezratty et al., 2011

;

Dai et al., 2013

;

Chen et al., 2015

;

Yang et al., 2015

). Future studies at postnatal stages will determine whether Celsr proteins function beyond PCP in the skin—for example in hair follicle cycling and regeneration or perhaps in the migration and innervation of sensory neurons.

Experimental procedures

Generation of mouse lines and breeding

All mouse work was approved by Princeton University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were housed in an AALAC- accredited facility. Housing, maintenance, and husbandry of animals followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and laboratory Animal Welfare Act.

The mice were generated at the Genome Editing Core Facility at Rutgers-Cancer Institute of New Jersey using CRISPR targeting the start site and signal sequence of the Celsr1 and Celsr2 genes simultaneously. Many knockouts were generated and sequenced. Two mouse lines were selected that contained a deletion of 81 bp spanning the start site and beginning of the signal sequence of Celsr1 and Celsr2, respectively. N1 founder mice were outcrossed to C57Bl/6J five times. The new alleles were named

Celsr1

<em1Ddev>

and

Celsr2

<em1Ddev>

, and were maintained as heterozygotes.

Genotyping PCRs were designed to discriminate between WT and knockout lines. To genotype for the

Celsr1

<em1Ddev>

allele, a PCR was designed using primers surrounding the 81 bp deletion, resulting in a smaller fragment in the knockout. Similarly, to genotype the

Celsr2

<em1Ddev>

allele, PCR primers were designed on either side of the deletion site (

Supplementary Figure S1

; see

Table 1

for primer sequences and expected PCR product sizes).

Western blot analysis

Epidermal lysates were obtained by dissection of backskin from P0- P2 postnatal pups. To extract proteins, backskins were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground into a powder in a cryomill machine (Retsch,Newtown, PA) for 30 s while frozen using liquid nitrogen. For each backskin, 700 ul of RIPA buffer (Abcam) was added to the ground powder, the samples were vortexed and then incubated on ice for 15 min. Following incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 17,000g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were removed and processed

via

western blot. Standard protocols were performed for western blot- proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and detected using primary antibodies against Celsr1 (

Devenport and Fuchs, 2008

), Celsr2 (goat, R&D Systems, 1:200), and E-cadherin (rabbit, Cell Signaling, 1:250 or rat, ThermoFisher, 1:1000). IRDye680 and IRDye800 secondary antibodies (LI-COR, 1:10,000) and the LI-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system were used to detect the bands. See

Immunofluorescence and image acquisition of embryonic backskins

Fixing and staining of backskins was done as previously described (

Basta et al., 2021

). Briefly, E15.5 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS ++ for 1 h at room temperature. For all antibodies apart from P-cadherin, backskins were dissected and blocked at 4°C in 2% normal goat serum, 2% normal donkey serum (or 4% normal donkey serum and no goat serum when staining for Fz6), 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% fish gelatin in PBT2 (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100). For P-cadherin, samples were blocked in in 2% normal goat serum, 2% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% fish gelatin in TBT2 (TBS with 0.2% Triton X-100). Following incubation in block, samples were incubated in primary antibody in PBT2 block (TBT2 block for P-cadherin staining) at 4°C overnight. Samples were washed in PBT2 five times for at least 30 min at room temperature, incubated with secondary antibodies and Hoechst (Invitrogen, Cat: H1399, 1:1000) overnight at 4°C, and then washed in PBT2 three times for at least 10 min. After a final wash in PBS, samples were mounted in Prolong Gold.

The following primary antibodies were used: guinea pig anti-Celsr1 (Danelle Devenport, 1:1000), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:250, Cell Signaling: 3195), rat anti-Vangl2 (1:100, Millipore, Cat: MABN750), goat anti-Fz6 (1:400, R&D Biosystems, Cat: AF1526), rabbit anti-Sox9 (Millipore, AB5535, 1:1000), rat anti-P-cadherin (Clontech, M109, 1:200). Alexa Fluor −488, −555, and −647 secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000 (Invitrogen or Jackson ImmunoResearch). See

Table 2

for full list of antibodies and reagents.

For hair follicle polarity analysis, images were acquired using a Nikon A1R-Si confocal microscope operated by NIS Elements software, using PlanApo 20 × 0.75 NA air and 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objectives for resonance and galvo image capture respectively. 20 × images were then stitched in NIS Elements and processed in Fiji to generate an Average Intensity Projection (AIP) for input to the automated segmentation and angle calculation MATLAB algorithm. 60 × images were processed in Fiji.

For analysis of core PCP protein asymmetry in the basal layer, images were acquired on Nikon A1R-Si confocal microscope controlled by NIS Elements software using PlanApo 60 × 1.4 NA oil. Images were processed using NIS elements and ImageJ.

Isolation of primary keratinocytes and keratinocyte culture

Keratinocytes were isolated from

Celsr1

−/−

; Celsr2

−/−

pups at P1 and established as cell lines using previously published protocol (

Nowak and Fuchs, 2009

). Keratinocytes were grown using E-Media prepared in the laboratory according to published protocol (

Nowak and Fuchs, 2009

) supplemented with 50 µM calcium chloride. For live FRAP experiments, phenol-red free DMEM and F-12 were used to prepare pigment-free imaging E-media. Cells were transfected using Effectene reagent following a modified manufacturer’s protocol. 300 ng of DNA was used in the transfection mix for each well of 12-well plates and 400 ng plasmid DNA was used for each well of 6-well plates and 35-mm imaging dishes. For co-transfection with two different plasmids, one of which is Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP, a ratio of 2:1 of Celsr1/Celsr2: the other plasmid DNA was used. See

Table 2

for full list of plasmids used in this study.

For junction enrichment assays, approximately 100,000 keratinocytes were seeded onto fibronectin coated 1.8-mm, #1.5 glass coverslips in each well of 12-well plates. Approximately 24 h post-seeding, cells were transfected with the necessary plasmids. 24 h post transfection, cells were switched from low calcium E-media (50 µM) to high calcium E-media containing 1.5 mM Ca

2+

. After 24 h of incubation, cells were fixed and stained for imaging (see below). For heterotypic junction enrichment assays, −150,000 cells were seeded into each well of 6 well plates. 24 h post seeding, each well was individually transfected with one of the following constructs: Celsr1-3XFLAG, Celsr1-3X-Myc, Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP. 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, mixed and replated, with one Celsr1-FLAG or Celsr1-Myc transfected well combined with either one well of Celsr1-GFP or one well of Celsr2-GFP. −180,000 cells from the 1:1 mixture were seeded onto fibronectin coated 1.8-mm, #1.5 glass coverslips in each well of 12-well plates. 4–5 h post plating, media was switched to E-media containing 1.5 mM Ca

2+

. After an additional 24 h, cells were fixed and stained for microscopy.

Immunofluorescence of keratinocytes

After incubation in high calcium E-media, confluent monolayers of keratinocytes were rinsed in PBS containing calcium and magnesium (PBS++) and fixed with 4% PFA prepared in PBS++ for 10 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization for 10 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 (PBT1). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in PBT1 and cells were incubated with the same for 30 min. Following primary antibody treatment, cells were washed three times in PBS and further incubated for 30 min in secondary antibodies and Hoechst diluted to 1:2000 in PBS. Cells were finally washed three times in PBS and mounted on glass slides using Prolong Gold, cured overnight in the dark and imaged.

Image segmentation and polarity analysis

S

egmentation of basal epidermal cells and polarity analysis of core PCP proteins. Cell Pose (

Stringer et al., 2021

) was used to segment images of the whole mount embryonic epidermis. Segmentation masks were obtained using the E-cadherin or P-cadherin markers, and masks were post-processed, and hand corrected in ImageJ. The same mask from the E-cadherin or P-cadherin marker was used on the other channels in the image.

As previously described, polarity analysis was done using the Tissue Analyzer V2 software in ImageJ (

Aigouy et al., 2010

;

Basta et al., 2021

). Cell edges were defined by the segmentation masks generated as described above. Tissue Analyzer used the segmentation masks to calculate the axis and magnitude (nematic order) of membrane localized proteins (as defined in

Aigouy et al., 2016

), including for PCP proteins. Circular histograms plotting the data were generated using MATLAB, with average polarity magnitude indicating the angle and strength of polarity. Prior to analysis, images were rotated to align them with the anterior-posterior axis.

Segmentation and polarity analysis of hair follicles. To determine the orientation of hair follicle growth, AIP images were analyzed using a custom MATLAB script followed by visual

ad hoc

hand correction. This script segments regions of the hair follicle based on Sox9 and P-cadherin fluorescence intensity and uses the geometric relationship between segmented regions to categorize polarized and non-polarized follicles as well as to calculate the angle of growth of polarized follicles.

Image acquisition and analysis of junction enrichment assay

Cells were imaged using a PlanApo 20 × 0.75NA Air objective with additional zoom on a Nikon A1R-Si confocal microscope using the relevant combination of 405, 488, 561, and 643 nm laser illumination. Image acquisition was sequentially carried out to avoid bleed-through. Maximum intensity projections from Z stacks were made in Fiji. Images were background subtracted. ROIs were drawn along the junctions marked by either Celsr1-GFP/Celsr2-GFP/GFP-CAAX as applicable. Another ROI was made along the periphery of the participating cell or the two adjacent cells sharing the junction, as applicable. A ratio was obtained of the background corrected mean intensities of the junction and the cell pair/individual cell ROI as follows:

FRAP

Approximately 150,000 keratinocytes were seeded in #1.5 glass bottom dishes (ibidi #81151) coated with fibronectin. 20–24 h post-plating, cells were transiently transfected with Celsr1-GFP or Celsr2-GFP plasmids. 24 h post-transfection, cells were switched to E-media containing 1.5 mM Ca

2+

and incubated for an additional 20–24 h for Celsr1-GFP and Celsr2-GFP expression. Before imaging, cells were switched to phenol-red free E-media containing 1.5 mM Ca

2+

and 20 mM HEPES. Cells were imaged using a 488 nm laser, Plan Apo 60 × 1.4NA oil immersion objective (with additional zoom that rendered a pixel size of 110 nm) on Nikon A1R confocal microscope equipped with a stage-top Tokai-Hit incubation chamber to maintain 37° and 5% CO

2

. Keeping magnification, laser power (both for bleach and acquisition), pixel dwell time and acquisition rate constant across all measurements, 1-um diameter circular bleach ROIs and three ROIs per image were created to sample the junction(s) or cells edge(s). The FRAP acquisition sequence consisted of three reference pre-bleach images followed by bleach (5.9 s) and finally 60 frames with 5-s intervals to monitor fluorescence recovery. The acquired images in the time series were checked for any Z-drift and corrected for XY-drift in Fiji. A reference ROI was made in a non-bleached region to correct for overall bleaching during image acquisition. A background ROI was created outside the cell in each image. The ROI values were extracted from drift corrected images in NIS elements software for subsequent analysis in Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism. Each image time series was background and bleach corrected (to be referred as corrected intensity henceforth) and thereafter the corrected intensity profile was normalized as

(F

)/(F

)

, where, F

t

is the corrected intensity of the ROI at a given time point, F

. The averaged traces for each condition was fitted to the model with an r-squared value >0.93.

Data was analyzed using Nikon NIS elements and ImageJ/FIJI and Microsoft Excel. Graphs were plotted using Graphpad Prism. Data represented is pooled from at least two independent experiments for cell edges and at least three independent experiments for junctions where each experiment follows the represented trend.

### Gene: PACSIN2 (5 articles)

#### PACSIN2 - Article 1: Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Regulates Podocyte Architecture in Coordination with N-WASP
<Date>: 2023-5-27
<PMCID>: 10252800
<Full Text Content>:
1. Introduction

Mammalian cells are highly complex self-organizing structures whose dynamic build is determined by numerous parameters such as size, shape, position and polarity, as well as internal and external signaling. The signaling mechanisms by which cells maintain this structure depend on the coordination between the cytoskeleton and proteins at the cell membrane. Podocytes, the glomerular visceral epithelial cells, perfectly illustrate the importance of the cytoskeleton in maintaining optimal cell function. In vivo, podocytes form interdigitating projections, called foot processes. The inter-cellular junctional structure joining adjacent foot processes is called the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm contains proteins typical of adherents and tight junctions [

1

,

2

] as well as unique podocyte proteins (e.g., nephrin) [

3

], which are connected to the actin cytoskeleton in order to maintain the functional integrity of podocytes [

4

]. During injury, for instance, diabetes and its complication of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the rearrangement of the podocyte cytoskeleton leads to foot process flattening and retraction [

5

]. Since podocytes constitute an essential layer of the kidney filtration barrier, defects in their morphological stability and matrix adherence lead to kidney dysfunction.

Here, we sought to investigate the role of the actin-binding protein PACSIN2 (i.e., syndapin2) in regulating podocyte morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement and establish the biological relevance of its phosphorylation at S313 in podocytes. Recent reports link PACSIN2 to angiogenic sprouting [

6

], epithelial microvilli morphogenesis [

7

] and kidney tubule ciliogenesis [

8

]. These studies point out the role of PACSIN2 in the regulation of morphology and cell architecture. Furthermore, a study by Senju et al. brings to light the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 by protein kinase C α (PKCα) at serine 313 (S313), which can be triggered by cell detachment and shear stress [

9

]. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 decreased its ability to bind to the plasma membrane and decreased the life span of caveolae [

9

]. However, the significance of S313 phosphorylation in various cellular processes, including cell spreading or survival, remains uncharacterized. We previously showed that the expression of PACSIN2 increases in glomeruli in DKD and accelerates the recycling of nephrin [

10

]. Despite this apparent association with glomerular pathophysiology, it remained unclear whether upregulation of PACSIN2 was beneficial in DKD and how it was triggered and regulated.

Relying on a rat model for obesity, diabetes and severe DKD, along with human nephrectomy samples and serum samples from individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), we show that the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 associates with increased circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and kidney dysfunction. Using cultured podocytes, we demonstrate that, in cooperation with N-WASP, PACSIN2 orchestrates architectural changes in podocytes, which can be influenced by the phosphorylation status of S313 and in turn impact the response of podocytes to injury.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Preparation of ZDF Rat and Human Glomerular Lysates

The isolation of glomeruli from ZDF rats (RRID: RGD_12859287) was performed using graded sieving with 250/150/75 µm sieves (Retsch, Haan, Germany) as previously described [

10

]. Human glomeruli were isolated from the non-malignant part of the kidneys from surgical nephrectomies performed at the Helsinki University Hospital using 425/250/150 µm sieves. Glomeruli were lysed in NP-40-based lysis buffer [

11

].

2.2. Western Blotting

Podocyte and glomerular lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as previously described [

10

], followed by imaging with the Odyssey

®

CLx Imager (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) and quantification with Image Studio Lite 5.2 (LI-COR). The following antibodies were used: α-tubulin (T6199, mouse monoclonal), β-actin (A3853, mouse monoclonal, AB_262137), PACSIN2 (SAB1402538, mouse monoclonal) and Rac1 (05-389, mouse monoclonal) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), N-WASP (4848, rabbit monoclonal), RhoA (2117, rabbit monoclonal) and phospho-PKC Substrate (6967, rabbit mAb mix) from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), PACSIN2 (AP8088b, rabbit polyclonal) from ABGent (San Diego, CA, USA) and PKCα (AB11723, mouse monoclonal) from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibodies for ubiquitin (sc177749, mouse monoclonal), FilaminA (sc177749, mouse monoclonal) and Dynamin2 (sc1666-69, mouse monoclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA, USA). IRDye 800CW anti-rabbit IgG (926-32213, donkey) and IRDye 680RD anti-mouse IgG (926-68072, donkey) were from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA). The antibody specific for PACSIN2 when phosphorylated at serine 313 (rabbit polyclonal) was described in reference [

9

]. Independent experiments were conducted on different days from cells with different passages. Each experiment was divided into separate replicates, treated and lysed separately. These replicates are displayed as individual data points.

2.3. Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell Lysates

Human podocytes, shown to be negative for mycoplasma, were maintained as described [

12

]. Shortly, proliferating podocytes were maintained in permissive conditions at 33 °C and thermo-switched to 37 °C to differentiate for 7–14 days. Sodium palmitate (Merck) was conjugated to FFA-free bovine serum albumin (BSA, Merck) at a 3:1 molar ratio at 37 °C for 1–2 h. When specified, fetal bovine serum in the medium was replaced by serum from individuals with T2D having either normal albumin excretion rate or moderate albuminuria, for 48 h before lysing the cells. The status of albuminuria was determined according to guidelines set by Nomenclature for kidney function and disease—executive summary and glossary from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [

13

]. High glucose treatment was performed by differentiating the cells for 10–14 days in a medium containing 30 mM glucose or 11 mM glucose and 19 mM mannitol as a control. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate synthetic (PMA) treatment was performed on differentiated podocytes at 50 μM for 1 h. For palmitate treatment, the medium was supplemented for the specified length of time with 100 µM or 200 µM BSA-palmitate or BSA alone as a control, with or without bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, Merck) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control. Cells were treated with 20 μM Wiskostatin (W2270, Merck) for 30 min, 50 μM tetracycline hydrochloride (T7660, Merck,) for 16 h, 10 μM LY294002 (S1105, Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) for 16 h or 10 μM MMP-9 Inhibitor I (CAS 1177749-58-4—Calbiochem, Merck) for 16 h.

Proliferating podocytes were transiently transfected with flag-PKCα [

9

] or GFP-N-WASP [

14

] using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Cells were lysed in NP-40 or RIPA-buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described in [

11

,

15

].

2.4. FFA Measurements

Origin, maintenance, sacrifice and metabolic measurements of 8 and 34 weeks old lean and obese male ZDF-Leprfa/Crt rats have been previously described [

10

]. The FFA content of the serum of the ZDF rats and the individuals with T2D used to stimulate differentiated podocytes, were measured at the Biochemical Analysis Core for Experimental Research of the University of Helsinki using ADVIA 1650 (Siemens, Munich, Germany).

2.5. Apoptosis Assay

Proliferating podocytes were transfected with GFP-ev (empty vector), PACSIN2-wt, PACSIN2-S313E or PACSIN2-S313A using Lipofectamine 2000 [

9

]. After 72 h, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with Annexin V-APC 1:50 (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The percentage of Annexin V-APC positive cells, in the GFP positive population, was measured by flow cytometry using BDaccuri (BD Life Sciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). A total of 10

5

cells were detected in each sample.

2.6. Adhesion Assay

PACSIN2-wt or S313E/A cDNAs, described in [

9

], were subcloned into pCMV-myc vector (Cat. 631604, PT3282-5, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) using KpnI and EcoRI sites. The constructs were verified by sequencing (see

Supplementary Materials

). Proliferating podocytes were transfected with myc-ev, PACSIN2-wt, PACSIN2-S313E or PACSIN2-S313A using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and counted. Tissue culture 96-well plastic plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA) were coated with collagen IV or poly-L-Lysine for 1 h at 37 °C. Unspecific binding to the plates was blocked by incubating the wells with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. 1 × 10

5

cells were seeded to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed by means of immersion into a plastic tray containing PBS. Adhered cells were fixed with methanol and stained with Crystal Violet for 30 min (20% methanol, 0.1% Crystal Violet in H

2

O). After intense washings, cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and the number of cells was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 mm using Hidex (Hidex, Turku, Finland).

2.7. Ubiquitination Assay

PACSIN2-wt or S313E/A were transiently transfected into proliferating human podocytes. Cells were lysed in NP-40 buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with anti-N-WASP antibodies or rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) as a control. The immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose, washed with lysis buffer and immunoblotted as described above.

2.8. Immunofluorescence Analyses

PACSIN2-wt or S313E/A were transiently transfected into proliferating human podocytes. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 and stained when mentioned with CellMask Blue (H32720, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Hoechst (33342, Merck), anti-β-tubulin III IgG (T2200, rabbit polyclonal, AB_262133, Merck), phalloidin-488 (1:250, A12379, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to stain filamentous actin (F-actin), c-myc (M4439, mouse monoclonal, Merck,) and paxillin (610051, mouse monoclonal; BD Transduction laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to stain focal adhesions. Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG (A-21207, donkey polyclonal, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (A21202, donkey polyclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific)) were used as secondary antibodies. Imaging was carried out using the Opera Phenix HCS system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with a 20× air objective (NA 0.4), followed by processing with CellProfiler 3.1.8 (

https://cellprofiler.org/

accessed on 10 January 2023) [

16

] to correct for non-uniform illumination, detect the cells or focal adhesions and extract numerical features.

2.9. Cell Classification

Advanced Cell Classifier (

http://www.cellclassifier.org/

accessed on 12 December 2019) [

17

] was used to assign a phenotype to each cell by using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) supervised machine learning strategy where a non-linear model was trained from manually given annotations to classify each cell to a phenotype based on the numerical features measured with CellProfiler. To avoid technical bias, two independent models were trained on Advanced Cell Classifier to classify cells based on their (1) PACSIN2 overexpression and (2) overall cell morphology based on the actin cytoskeleton. For PACSIN2 overexpression, a model was trained to classify the cells into three phenotypes based on the intensity of myc staining: no, weak and high PACSIN2 overexpression. Only the numerical features for CellMask, Hoechst and c-myc were used to determine the over-expression phenotype. For cell morphology, another model was trained to classify the cells as “normal”, “altered” or rounded/dividing phenotype. The “normal” phenotype was defined as having well-organized and clear actin stress fibers whereas the “altered” phenotype included cells with disorganized actin or changed overall cell morphology based on the actin cytoskeleton. Only the numerical features for CellMask, Hoechst and phalloidin were used to determine the phenotype of the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology. Based on the predictions using these two models, each cell received a class for the overexpression status and a class for the actin cytoskeleton and morphology status. The impact of myc-PACSIN2-wt/S313E/S313A overexpression was evaluated within individual coverslips by comparing the ratio of “normal” and “altered” cells amongst cells with high or no myc staining. Multiple features were analyzed for these two classes, using CellProfiler including those presented. FormFactor is calculated as 4 × π × Area/Perimeter2 and equals 1 for a perfectly circular object. Texture analyses measure intensity variation using the co-occurrence matrix.

2.10. Statistical Analyses

The statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad version 8.4.2 software (GraphPad Prism Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and data were presented as mean ± SD. To compare differences between groups, we performed a Mann–Whitney test (two groups) or a one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni post hoc test (multiple groups). For high-content analyzes, only a

p

-value of 0.001 or smaller was considered statistically significant.

3. Results

3.1. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Is Increased in the Glomeruli of Obese ZDF Rats

We observed that pS313-PACSIN2 was increased in the glomeruli isolated from obese ZDF rats at the age of 8 weeks compared to the glomeruli obtained from lean controls, but the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 was not increased (

Figure 1

A–D). In the glomeruli of 34-week-old obese rats, both the pS313-PACSIN2 and total level of PACSIN2 increased (

Figure 1

E–G), the latter also previously observed by our group [

10

]. Notably, the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 was increased in the glomeruli of 34-week-old rats (

Figure 1

H). These data suggest that diabetic conditions and potentially the progression of kidney disease, trigger phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313.

3.2. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Associates with DKD Rather Than with Diabetes

Next, we explored whether the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 was an early feature of diabetes, preceding the onset of albuminuria. We used human glomeruli isolated from individuals with T2D without DKD (their clinical characteristics are presented in

Supplemental Table S1

). We found that neither total nor pS313-PACSIN2 levels were changed in the glomeruli isolated from individuals with T2D, in comparison to individuals without diabetes (

Figure 2

A–D). Additionally, high glucose treatment of cultured differentiated human podocytes did not affect the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 or total PACSIN2 expression (

Figure 2

E–H). We hypothesized that diabetes and hyperglycemia alone were not sufficient to trigger the phosphorylation of PACSIN2. Therefore, we cultured differentiated human podocytes with serum from individuals with T2D, who have either normal albumin excretion rate or moderate albuminuria (their clinical characteristics are presented in

Supplemental Table S2

). The serum samples from the individuals with T2D and moderate albuminuria triggered a significant increase in pS313-PACSIN2 with a limited effect on total PACSIN2 or the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 when compared to podocytes treated with serum from individuals with T2D and normal albumin excretion rate (

Figure 2

I–L). These results suggest that the increase in total PACSIN2 and its phosphorylation at S313 are not a feature of diabetes per se but rather of the progression towards its complication, DKD. These data also propose that factors other than hyperglycemia lead to phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 upon the development of DKD.

3.3. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Is Induced by Palmitate in a PKC-Dependent Manner

One of the factors contributing to kidney damage in DKD is dyslipidemia with concomitant accumulation of FFA in the bloodstream [

18

]. We, therefore, studied whether FFA triggers the phosphorylation of PACSIN2. We measured the FFA content in serum samples obtained from ZDF rats at 8 and 34 weeks of age and in serum samples of individuals with T2D (used in

Figure 2

I–L). As expected, the serum samples from the obese ZDF rats showed increased FFA levels compared to controls (

Figure 3

A,B). In the case of the serum from the individuals with T2D, the group with moderate albuminuria showed a trend of increase in FFA levels compared to the group with normal albumin excretion rate (

Figure 3

C). To confirm the link between FFA accumulation and phosphorylation of PACSIN2, we treated differentiated human podocytes with palmitate, the most abundant FFA in circulation. We found that palmitate significantly increased the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 (

Figure 3

D–G). We then hypothesized that the effects of palmitate on PACSIN2 phosphorylation were dependent on PKCα, which has been shown to phosphorylate PACSIN2 at S313 in Hela Cells (9). First, we addressed the question of whether PKCα mediates the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 in podocytes. We found that in the glomeruli of the 34-weeks-old obese ZDF rats when phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 was the highest (

Figure 1

F), PKCα expression was increased (

Figure 3

H,I). Additionally, in differentiated human podocytes in culture, pharmacological activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate synthetic (PMA) drastically increased pS313-PACSIN2 and the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 (

Figure 3

J–M). Overexpression of PKCα in proliferating human podocytes increased both the expression of PACSIN2 and its phosphorylation at S313 without affecting the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 (

Figure S1

). These data indicate that PKC regulates the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 in podocytes. Based on these observations, we reasoned that inhibition of PKC could suppress the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 triggered upon palmitate treatment. We co-treated differentiated human podocytes with palmitate and the pharmacological inhibitor of PKC (bisindolylmaleimide, BIM). We found that, as anticipated, BIM prevented palmitate-induced phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 (

Figure 3

N–Q). Taken together, our data imply that palmitate induces phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 in podocytes through PKC.

3.4. PACSIN2 Overexpression Reduces Apoptosis and Enhances Adhesion Independently of the Phosphorylation Status at S313

Since pS313-PACSIN2 associates with kidney dysfunction and can be triggered by increased FFA, we examined whether phosphorylation of PACSIN2 was a protective or harmful mechanism in podocytes. In DKD, podocyte numbers are typically reduced due to detachment and/or apoptosis [

5

,

19

,

20

,

21

]. We overexpressed in proliferating podocytes GFP-PACSIN2-wild-type (GFP-PACSIN2-wt) and S313 phosphomimetic (GFP-PACSIN2-S313E) or non-phosphorylatable S313 (GFP-PACSIN2-S313A). We then measured the percentage of apoptotic annexin V-positive cells amongst the GFP-positive cell population (

Figure 4

A,B). We found that overexpression of GFP-PACSIN2-wt, GFP-PACSIN2-S313E and GFP-PACSIN2-S313A reduced apoptosis compared to the control GFP-empty-vector (GFP-ev). We also assessed podocyte adhesion to two different substrates (poly-L-lysine or collagen IV) after overexpression of myc-PACSIN2-wt, myc-PACSIN2-S313E and myc-PACSIN2-S313A. We found that overexpression of PACSIN2-wt increased adhesion to poly-L-lysine and collagen IV compared to the myc-ev (

Figure 4

C,D). The myc-PACSIN2 mutants showed a similar increase in reattachment compared to myc-ev, irrespective of the substrate. Intriguingly, we found no significant difference in adherence between the variants of PACSIN2. These experiments demonstrate that increased expression of PACSIN2 reduces podocyte apoptosis and improves adhesion regardless of the phosphorylation status of S313.

3.5. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Associates with Increased N-WASP Expression

To investigate the potential pathways affected by the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313, we turned our attention to the interaction partners of PACSIN2 (Dynamin2 regulating trafficking and actin assembly and N-WASP, FilaminA, Rac1 and RhoA regulating actin cytoskeleton organization). Transient overexpression of PACSIN2-S313E in proliferating human podocytes induced an increase in N-WASP levels in comparison to empty vector (

Figure 5

A,B), without affecting the expression levels of Dynamin2, FilaminA, Rac1 and RhoA (

Figure 5

A,C–F). The increased N-WASP level following PACSIN2-S313E overexpression is likely due to decreased degradation of N-WASP, as we found that N-WASP immunoprecipitated from the lysates were less ubiquitinated when PACSIN2 phosphomimetic was overexpressed in cultured podocytes (

Figure 5

G,H). We also measured the expression level of N-WASP in the glomeruli isolated from obese ZDF rats at the ages of 8 and 34 weeks and found that N-WASP expression was increased compared to lean rats (

Figure 5

I–K). In glomerular lysates from individuals with T2D, we observed a trend of increase in N-WASP in comparison to controls (

Figure S2

). Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation at S313 increases N-WASP expression, suggesting that S313 phosphorylation regulates actin-associated processes.

3.6. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Is Regulated by N-WASP Activity

Based on the observation that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 regulates N-WASP levels in podocytes, we reasoned that N-WASP could regulate the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 in return. Overexpression of N-WASP in cultured podocytes increased PACSIN2 expression (

Figure S3A,C

) but did not affect pS313-PACSIN2 or the ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 (

Figure S3A,B,D

). We then treated differentiated human podocytes with the pharmacological inhibitor of N-WASP (wiskostatin). We found that wiskostatin increased the expression of PACSIN2 and drastically induced its phosphorylation at S313 (

Figure 6

A–D). This coincided with an increase in PKC activity (

Figure 6

E). We also observed that in cultured human podocytes, wiskostatin caused cells to retract (

Figure 6

F). We, therefore, reasoned that the phosphorylation status of PACSIN2 could be involved in these morphological changes. We overexpressed in proliferating human podocytes GFP-PACSIN2-wt, GFP-PACSIN2-S313E or GFP-PACSIN2-S313A and then measured cell size with and without wiskostatin treatment. We found that podocytes overexpressing GFP-PACSIN2-wt and -S313E remained significantly larger after wiskostatin treatment compared to cells overexpressing the control vector and treated with wiskostatin (

Figure 6

F–G,

Table S3

). On the other hand, cells overexpressing non-phosphorylatable PACSIN2 sustained a notable decrease in size compared to cells overexpressing S313A treated with DMSO (

Figure 6

F–G,

Table S3

). We also found that N-WASP inhibition altered GFP-PACSIN2 localization regardless of its phosphorylation status, causing it to form aggregates (

Figure 6

F). Taken together, these data suggest that N-WASP regulates PACSIN2 phosphorylation at S313 and that PACSIN2 and N-WASP cooperate to regulate the morphology of podocytes.

3.7. Dynamic Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 Is Required for Cell Spreading In Vitro

Analyses of wiskostatin-treated podocytes showed differences in cell size in podocytes overexpressing PACSIN2 without any treatment (

Figure 6

G). Additionally, in podocytes, N-WASP was previously shown to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton and maintain podocyte architecture [

22

]. We, therefore, reasoned that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 would affect actin-based processes such as cell morphology and cell spreading. We overexpressed in proliferating human podocytes GFP-PACSIN2-wt, GFP-PACSIN2-S313E or GFP-PACSIN2-S313A and then performed immunofluorescence-based high-content analysis followed by quantitative single-cell morphometry. We found that podocytes overexpressing GFP-PACSIN2-wt were larger than the cells overexpressing the control vector (

Figure 7

A,B,

Table S4

) and possessed more focal adhesions (FA) per cell (

Figure 7

C,D). Overexpression of S313 phosphomimetic slightly increased cell size and both mutants of PACSIN2 slightly increased the FA number in comparison to GFP-ev, but less than overexpression of GFP-PACSIN2-wt (

Figure 7

A–D,

Table S5

). These observations suggest that in podocytes, PACSIN2 regulates cell spreading.

We then tested whether the phosphorylation status of PACSIN2 at S313 would affect the response of podocytes to actin-related injury. We altered the actin cytoskeleton using cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin polymerization and assembly causing cells to retract. We then monitored the recovery after the washout (

Figure 7

E). We found that upon injury, cells retracted similarly regardless of PACSIN2 overexpression or its phosphorylation status (

Figure 7

F). However, during the expansion phase, podocytes overexpressing GFP-PACSIN2-wt showed a faster and more prominent increase in cell size compared to the control GFP-ev. Both mutants, S313E and S313A, behaved similarly to the control. Collectively, these data suggest that static phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 halts its ability to regulate cell spreading. This is reinforced by the observation that during the washout of cytochalasin D in differentiated podocytes, endogenous levels of PACSIN2 initially increased at 15 min and then decreased at 90 min, while the phosphorylation at S313 was maintained at a constant level (

Figure S4A–D

). Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of pharmacological inhibition of cell motility using three different compounds (tetracycline, LY294002 and MMP-9 inhibitor I, [

23

,

24

,

25

,

26

,

27

,

28

]) in proliferating podocytes. The ratio of pS313-PACSIN2 to total PACSIN2 increased after LY294002 treatment, decreased after MMP-9 inhibitor I treatment and remained stable after tetracycline treatment (

Figure 7

G–J). These data support the notion that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 are involved in the regulation of cell spreading and motility, depending on the nature of the stimulus, the mechanisms at play and the kinetics of the pharmacological compound.

We speculated that the decreased cell spreading observed so far when overexpressing mutated forms of PACSIN2 in comparison to wt-PACSIN2 could be explained by differences in actin arrangement. We overexpressed in proliferating human podocytes myc-PACSIN2-wt, -S313E and -S313A; then we trained Advanced Cell Classifier to recognize their altered morphology (examples are shown in

Figure 8

A). We used cells not expressing PACSIN2 on the same coverslip as internal controls, to account for the potential effects of cell density and cell-cell interaction. We found that overexpression of myc-PACSIN2-S313E decreased the ratio of altered to normal cells in comparison to myc-PACSIN2-wt and myc-PACSIN2-S313A overexpression (

Figure 8

B). A closer look into the specific features distinguishing PACSIN2-S313E from -wt and -S313A shows that, compared to the internal control, overexpression of myc-PACSIN2-S313E limited the increase in cell rounding induced by PACSIN2 overexpression (

Figure 8

C) and reduced the increase in F-actin intensity and reorganization (

Figure 8

C–F). Taken together, these experiments indicate that, in podocytes, an increase in PACSIN2 initiates morphological alterations which can improve spreading by regulating actin arrangement and FA. Notably, for processes requiring active and rapid actin reorganization, dynamic phosphorylation is required.

4. Discussion

Our study shows that PACSIN2 is phosphorylated at S313 in DKD. We found that pS313-PACSIN2 increased with FFA accumulation, PKC activation and N-WASP inhibition. Our experiments highlight the reciprocity of the relationship between PACSIN2 and N-WASP as they coordinate to regulate cell architecture. Dynamic phosphorylation at S313 emerged as a regulatory mechanism during cytoskeletal reorganization. Since minor imbalances in podocyte cytoskeleton can disrupt the structural integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier, our data suggest that PACSIN2 could, via its phosphorylation at S313, be able to fine-tune the structure of the glomerular filtration barrier.

Previous studies have already linked PACSIN2 and N-WASP showing that PACSIN2 can directly interact with N-WASP and facilitate its recruitment to specific cellular locations, such as actin polymerization sites [

30

]. This ultimately influences actin dynamics by modulating N-WASP-mediated activation of Arp2/3, which initiates actin polymerization and branching [

22

]. Our study shows that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 regulates the interplay between PACSIN2 and N-WASP. Overexpression of S313 phosphomimetic in podocytes increased N-WASP levels (

Figure 5

A,B) and decreased N-WASP ubiquitination (

Figure 5

G,H). These data suggest that PACSIN2, through its phosphorylation at pS313, regulates N-WASP degradation. Suetsugu et al. have previously shown that N-WASP ubiquitination marks it for proteasomal degradation [

14

]. Since PACSIN2 directly interacts with N-WASP, it is possible that phosphorylation at S313 would stabilize the PACSIN2-N-WASP complex thereby preventing N-WASP recognition by its ubiquitin ligase or enhancing the association with deubiquitinating enzymes. In addition, it is plausible that phosphorylated PACSIN2 would alter N-WASP localization driving it away from proteasomes. Therefore, it seems likely that the increase in N-WASP observed in diabetic conditions (

Figure 5

I–K,

Figure S3

) could be at least partly induced by the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313.

On the other hand, we found that N-WASP was able to regulate PACSIN2 phosphorylation as well. Pharmacological inhibition of N-WASP distinctively increased pS313-PACSIN2 and upregulated PKC activity (

Figure 6

A–E). Since phosphorylation of PACSIN2 increases N-WASP levels, this could be a compensatory mechanism in podocytes to offset the N-WASP blockade. A previous study has shown that PKC activation affects N-WASP localization, but is unclear how N-WASP activates PKC and in turn, increases pS313-PACSIN2 [

31

]. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms at play. Nevertheless, this suggests that N-WASP, PACSIN2 and PKC are tightly connected. In podocytes, we found that PACSIN2 phosphorylation at S313 was regulated by PKC (

Figure 3

J–Q), aligning with previous studies of pS313-PACSIN2 [

9

]. However, pharmacological inhibition of PKC alone, using BIM, did not affect the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 (

Figure 3

N–O). This suggests that the level of PKC inhibition achieved by BIM is not sufficient to completely block PKC activity. Alternatively, other kinases or signaling pathways (such as those regulated by N-WASP) could be compensating for the loss of PKC activity thereby restituting phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313.

In our investigations, it was clear that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 was not required for all PACSIN2 functions. For instance, N-WASP inhibition altered the localization of all three forms of GFP-PACSIN2 (

Figure 6

F) and phosphorylation at S313 did not affect podocyte survival or re-adhesion (

Figure 4

). The main difference we observed after overexpression of the phosphomimetic PACSIN2, non-phosphorylatable PACSIN2 or wt-PACSIN2 constructs was the regulation of cell size and actin re-arrangement. Our data highlight the complexity of the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 and its dependence on specific triggers. We found that overexpression of PACSIN2, regardless of its phosphorylation status, did not induce drastic changes in actin arrangement. However, high content analyses showed an increase in cell rounding and a change in F-actin structure upon overexpression of wt-PACSIN2 and non-phosphorylatable PACSIN2, in comparison to PACSIN2 S313 phosphomimetic (

Figure 8

C,D). These changes in structure might initiate preparedness for fast active actin-related processes, such as cell spreading and migration. Qualmann et al. observed in their early investigations of syndapin (aka PACSIN) that overexpression of syndapin induced morphological changes and increased cortical actin in HeLa cells, in accordance with our findings [

32

]. In the presence of a trigger requiring actin rearrangement, depending on the activated signaling pathways, PACSIN2 can be phosphorylated (

Figure 6

A–D,

Figure 7

G–J), dephosphorylated or not affected (

Figure 7

G–J). It is also very likely that the regulation of PACSIN2 and its phosphorylation in the presence of various triggers would be cyclical, as suggested by the cytochalasin D analysis in

Figure S4

. This would explain why static phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at S313 would impede cell spreading after cytochalasin D treatment (

Figure 7

F).

A few mechanisms could explain how PACSIN2 and its phosphorylation at S313 can regulate podocyte architecture. Primarily, our experiments emphasize the interconnection between N-WASP and PACSIN2. Although we show that non-phosphorylatable PACSIN2 increases cell shrinkage with wiskostatin treatment (

Figure 6

G), more studies are needed to establish how the phosphorylation status of PACSIN2 affects N-WASP localization and activation. Additionally, PACSIN2 overexpression in its different forms does not affect Dynamin2, FilaminA, Rac1 and RhoA at the protein level (

Figure 5

A,C–F). However, it is plausible that these proteins could instead have altered localization, activation or interactions with crucial partners. Moreover, PACSIN2 directly interacts with actin via its F-BAR domain [

33

]. PACSIN2 uses this same domain to bind membranes, depending on phosphorylation at 313 [

9

]. It is possible that the functions of the PACSIN2-actin complex vary depending on the phosphorylation status of PACSIN2 due to, for example, a conformational change. Furthermore, PACSINs interact with Rac1, Dynamin2 and N-WASP, all proteins implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization [

34

,

35

,

36

,

37

,

38

]. Although PACSINs use their Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain to recruit these partners, full-length PACSIN proteins are required for their proper function and localization [

32

]. Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylation at S313 affects the ability of PACSIN2 to recruit partners via the SH3 domain.

In the context of diabetes, our study presents new links in the signaling pathways regulating the development of DKD. Our experiments suggest that FFA accumulation triggers the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 via PKC and that pS313-PACSIN2 associates with the progression toward kidney disease. Given that PKCα activation is largely dependent on glucose concentrations in podocytes [

39

,

40

], it was surprising that PACSIN2 expression and phosphorylation at S313 did not associate with diabetes and hyperglycemia (

Figure 2

). This, however, matches the metabolic parameters of the ZDF rats at ages 8-weeks vs. 34-weeks (detailed in our previous study [

10

]) showing that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 precedes hyperglycemia. The notion that PACSIN2 phosphorylation at S313 follows increased FFA aligns with findings from our previous study, showing that PACSIN2 responds to palmitate [

10

], the most abundant circulating FFA [

41

]. This corroborates a previous report linking palmitate and PKC in podocytes, wherein palmitate increased endoplasmic reticulum stress which was reduced by PKC inhibition [

42

]. Furthermore, our findings suggest a new link between N-WASP and PKC (

Figure 6

A,E), which implies that the increase in N-WASP observed in DKD (

Figure 5

I–K,

Figure S3

) could affect PKC activity and ultimately pS313-PACSIN2.

Our study has limitations. Cell transfections were performed in proliferating podocytes as opposed to differentiated podocytes; as in our experience, modulations of PACSIN2 expression in differentiated cultured podocytes are quickly abolished. Therefore, some of the differences seen in our study could be connected to differences in podocyte proliferation, which could affect the present results.

5. Conclusions

Our study shows that PACSIN2 is phosphorylated at S313 in diabetes and DKD. By overexpressing PACSIN2 in cultured podocytes, we show that PACSIN2 could play a protective role in DKD, by decreasing apoptosis and reinforcing matrix adhesion. Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at S313 emerged, in a complex interplay with N-WASP, as a dynamic process that could fine-tune the ability of PACSIN2 to modulate podocyte architecture. Our findings suggest that even mild cytoskeletal effects may have a substantial impact on the response of podocytes to injury, further emphasizing the complexity of the balancing forces behind cytoskeletal regulation. Future studies using knockout or transgenic PACSIN2 mice with experimentally induced DKD are needed to confirm whether changes in PACSIN2 levels affect podocyte survival and foot process effacement in vivo and understand the connection between PACSIN2, N-WASP and PKC.

<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Thiopurines, such as mercaptopurine and azathioprine, are purine analogues used in the treatment of hematological malignancies (i.e., acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) and inflammatory conditions (i.e., inflammatory bowel diseases, IBD) (

Bermejo et al, 2018

;

Lamb et al, 2019

;

Relling et al, 2019

). Through a complex anabolic enzymatic pathway, thiopurines are biotransformed into thionucleotides that exert the cytotoxic action responsible for treatment efficacy; thiopurines also undergo catabolic processes, in which the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) plays a major role by transforming mercaptopurine into the inactive methylmercaptopurine metabolite (

Zaza et al, 2010

). TPMT activity is an important determinant of severe adverse events during treatment with thiopurines (

Relling & Evans, 2015

;

Lucafò et al, 2018

). Genetic polymorphisms in the

TPMT

gene are major determinants of reduced TPMT activity, but there is substantial unexplained variability in TPMT activity in patients who inherit two wild-type

TPMT

alleles (

Tamm et al, 2017

). We previously showed that the TT genotype in the protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 (

PACSIN2

) rs2413739 (C > T) polymorphism modulates TPMT activity and mercaptopurine-induced toxicity, with a molecular mechanism that remains unclear (

Stocco et al, 2012

;

Franca et al, 2020

). In particular, the presence of the

PACSIN2

TT genotype in ALL patients was associated with reduced TPMT activity during the maintenance phase of treatment and also with the incidence of severe gastrointestinal toxicities during the consolidation therapy. The association between

PACSIN2

rs2413739 T variant and TPMT activity was not confirmed in a cohort of IBD pediatric patients undergoing azathioprine therapy; however, IBD pediatric carriers of the T allele presented reduced azathioprine effectiveness (

Stocco et al, 2012

;

Franca et al, 2020

). Furthermore, a positive correlation between PACSIN2 and TPMT protein concentration was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors, further supporting a possible role of

PACSIN2

in TPMT regulation (

Franca et al, 2020

). Other authors identified the

PACSIN2

rs2413739 TT genotype as a significant risk factor for the development of mercaptopurine-induced hematological toxicity in ALL pediatric patients presenting the wild-type

TPMT

genotype (

Smid et al, 2016

).

PACSIN2, also called syndapin II, is a protein involved in membrane remodeling pathways containing a FBAR domain (

Kessels & Qualmann, 2004

) that has been shown to inhibit vesicle formation by protein–protein interaction, influencing processes such as endocytosis (

Modregger et al, 2000

;

de Kreuk et al, 2012

) and caveolae formation (

Hansen et al, 2011

;

Senju et al, 2015

). Recently, it was demonstrated that PACSIN2 plays a role in the intestinal apical microvillus formation (

Postema et al, 2019

). Previous data demonstrated that the activity of overexpressed TPMT was reduced after

PACSIN2

knockdown (KD) in a human B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (NALM6). The agnostic gene expression analysis of NALM6 with

PACSIN2

(KD) identified autophagy as one of the pathways significantly affected by the reduction in

PACSIN2

, without indicating the direction of this possible effect or confirming these results with mechanistical analyses (

Stocco et al, 2012

). Previous studies showed that PACSIN1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy machinery (

Szyniarowski et al, 2011

;

Oe et al, 2022

). Autophagy is a conserved lysosome-dependent cellular degradation program that responds to different environmental and cellular stresses, such as the accumulation of unfolded protein aggregates, the presence of dysfunctional organelles, and the presence of intracellular pathogens (

Chun & Kim, 2018

). Autophagy is an important mechanism to maintain tissue homeostasis, and its tight regulation is fundamental to prevent pathogenic conditions (

Mizushima et al, 2008

). Indeed, impaired autophagy is associated with the development of many pathological conditions, including IBD (

Iida et al, 2017

). In intestinal epithelial cells, autophagy acts as a protective mechanism against cell death and inflammation (

Tang et al, 2011

;

Lapaquette et al, 2015

) through different molecular mechanisms that, however, are not fully understood yet (

Saitoh et al, 2008

). Autophagy begins with the formation of an autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle incorporating molecules destined for degradation; after autophagosome maturation, these vesicles fuse with lysosomes and the content will be degraded (

Zhao & Zhang, 2019

). Autophagy is usually investigated evaluating the cellular amount of both the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) protein and the sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1/P62) protein that are considered two important autophagic markers (

Klionsky et al, 2021

). LC3 is a protein involved in autophagosome elongation and maturation, whereas SQSTM1/P62 is involved in the receptor-mediated autophagy and serves as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated cargoes to generate the autophagosome around molecules destined for degradation (

Tanida et al, 2008

;

Liu et al, 2016

). Different autophagy modulators and receptors, such as SQSTM1/P62, exert their function on autophagy through an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif (

Pankiv et al, 2007

;

Cadwell et al, 2008

).

This study aims to clarify the role of PACSIN2 in autophagy and in thiopurine cytotoxicity in leukemic and intestinal models. Moreover, we hypothesized that the modulation of

PACSIN2

on TPMT activity and protein expression could be due to its role as a modulator of autophagy. We demonstrated a role of PACSIN2 as a negative regulator of autophagy, showing an increase in the basal autophagy level after

PACSIN2

KD in cell lines. Consistent results were reported also for primary tissues: lower

PACSIN2

mRNA and protein expression levels corresponded to higher autophagy and inflammation levels in colon samples of a cohort of IBD pediatric patients. PACSIN2 presented one LIR domain, responsible for PACSIN2 interaction with LC3. Furthermore, intestinal cell lines with

PACSIN2

KD were significantly more sensitive to mercaptopurine cytotoxic effects than control cells. Finally, mercaptopurine exposure decreased autophagy and stimulated apoptosis, especially in the presence of

PACSIN2

KD. However,

PACSIN2

KD led to lower TPMT protein concentrations, by mechanisms other than enhanced protein degradation by autophagy.

Results

PACSIN2 expression level is increased in autophagy-deficient cells and reduced in autophagy-competent cells upon induction of autophagy

Because the potential role of PACSIN2 in autophagy is largely unknown, we initially compared PACSIN2 protein levels between confluent autophagy-defective MEFs (Atg7

−/−

) and autophagy-proficient wild-type MEFs (Atg7

+/+

). Immunoblotting using a PACSIN2-specific antibody showed that PACSIN2 protein expression was almost two times higher in autophagy-defective cells compared with autophagy-proficient cells (fold change 1.7 ± 0.41,

P

= 0.049,

Fig 1

).

Autophagy-defective cells (Atg7

) (n = 5,

test,

P

= 0.049).

Representative densitometric analysis on immunoblots of confluent MEF cell lysates.

We then assessed whether PACSIN2 was degraded by autophagosomes: during treatment with the chemical inducer of autophagy rapamycin, the half-life of PACSIN2 was 34.7 ± 6.98 h in wild-type MEFs, compared with 117.5 ± 25.7 h in autophagy-deficient Atg7

−/−

cells (

P

= 0.030,

Fig 2

), which indicates that in autophagy-competent cells, PACSIN2 is targeted for degradation by the autophagosome.

test,

(n = 3,

Autophagy is increased after

PACSIN2

KD under basal condition

To determine whether PACSIN2 plays a role in autophagy, we performed immunoblotting assays to evaluate protein expression levels of the autophagic markers LC3-II and SQSTM1/P62 in both lymphoid (NALM6) and intestinal (LS180) cell lines (MOCK and

PACSIN2

KD), and also performed confocal microscopy measurement of GFP-LC3

punctae

in adherent cell lines HeLa

GFP-LC3

and RAW 264.7

GFP-LC3

cells (

Figs S1

and

).

Figure S1.

PACSIN2 expression level is decreased after

PACSIN2

silencing (KD) in different cell lines.

PACSIN2 levels were evaluated by Western blot using 50 μg of cell lysate for RAW 264.7

GFP-LC3

and HeLa cells and 10 μg of cell lysate for NALM6 and LS180 cells. The stable

PACSIN2

KD was obtained by transfecting cells with PACSIN2-specific shRNAs. In control cells, scramble shRNAs were used (MOCK). Actin was used to assess total protein loading normalization. Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left (kD). *1 indicates NALM6 cells overexpressing TPMT.

Figure S2.

TPMT expression in NALM6 cell lines.

NALM6 cells either expressed (MOCK) or silenced for PACSIN2 (KD) and overexpressing TPMT (*1) were evaluated for TPMT expression by Western blot using an anti-TPMT antibody. Immunoblotting was performed using 10 μg of cell lysate. As expected, NALM6 *1 and NALM6 KD*1 showed the overexpressed isoform of TPMT (38 kD), and interestingly, the immunoblotting results showed that the stable

PACSIN2

KD decreased only the overexpressed isoform of TPMT.

Under basal conditions, LC3-II was significantly more expressed in cells with

PACSIN2

KD compared with control cell lines in both NALM6 (fold change 2.1 ± 0.18,

P

= 0.0031,

Fig 3A

) and LS180 (fold change 1.3 ± 0.09,

P

= 0.028,

Fig 3B

). In NALM6, LC3-I was also significantly increased when

PACSIN2

was knocked down (fold change 1.7 ± 0.13,

P

= 0.0045,

Fig 3A

). Moreover, both NALM6 KD and LS180 KD cells presented lower SQSTM1/P62 levels compared with MOCK cells (fold change NALM6: 0.67 ± 0.09,

P

= 0.023,

Fig 3C

; LS180: 0.47 ± 0.14,

P

= 0.019,

Fig 3D

).

Figure 3.

Autophagy is increased in the presence of

PACSIN2

knockdown (KD) in lymphoid (NALM6) and intestinal (LS180) cell lines.

(A)

In NALM6 KD cells, there was an increase in both LC3-I (fold change 1.73 ± 0.127, n = 3,

t

test,

P

= 0.0045) and LC3-II (fold change 2.14 ± 0.179, n = 3, unpaired

t

test,

P

= 0.0031) compared with control cells. After chloroquine treatment, LC3-II levels were increased in both NALM6 MOCK and KD cell lines, and interestingly, LC3 increase was higher in NALM6 KD cells but further in NALM6 KD cells (fold change 1.48 ± 0.127, n = 5,

t

test,

P

= 0.0195). In these immunoblots, 30 μg of cell lysates was used under basal condition, whereas to detect LC3 after chloroquine treatment, the loaded amount of lysates was reduced to 10 μg to avoid signal saturation. The black lines in the blots indicated a splice between lanes.

(B)

LC3-II amount was higher in LS180 KD cells compared with MOCK, under basal condition (fold change 1.26 ± 0.09, n = 4,

t

test,

P

= 0.0277). In the presence of chloroquine treatment, both LS180 MOCK and LS180 KD cells presented higher LC3-II amount and these levels were significantly higher in LS180 KD cells (fold change 0.93 ± 0.03, n = 4,

t

test,

P

= 0.0355). In these experiments, we used 10 μg of cell lysates to evaluate LC3-II amount.

(C)

NALM6 KD cells presented lower SQSTM1/P62 levels compared with control cells under basal condition (fold change 0.62 ± 0.09, n = 3,

t

test,

P

= 0.023); 24 h of chloroquine treatment rescued SQSTM1/P62 levels in NALM6 KD cells (fold change 1.57 ± 0.1, n = 3,

t

test,

P

= 0.047). In these immunoblots, 30 μg of cell lysates was loaded to detect SQSTM1/P62 levels.

(D)

LS180 KD cells presented lower SQSTM1/P62 levels compared with control cells under basal condition (fold change 0.47 ± 0.14, n = 3,

t

test,

P

= 0.018); moreover, 24 h of chloroquine treatment increased SQSTM1/P62 concentrations, particularly in LS180 KD cells (fold change 3.94 ± 1.8, n = 3,

t

test,

P

= 0.046). In these experiments, we used 30 μg of cell lysates to evaluate SQSTM1/P62 amount.

Furthermore, we used cells with forced expression of GFP-LC3 and stable

PACSIN2

KD and measured the percentage of autophagic cells as demonstrated by the number of cells containing GFP-LC3

punctae

. RAW 264.7

GFP-LC3

KD cells presented an increased basal number of GFP-LC3

punctae

per cell compared with RAW 264.7

GFP-LC3

control cells (

Fig 4

). A similar trend was observed in HeLa

Measurement of GFP-LC3

was performed by confocal microscopy on confluent murine RAW 264.7 macrophages (n = 4,

test,

P

punctae

were counted in 110 ± 45 control cells and in 115 ± 34 cells with

PACSIN2

KD.

Figure S3.

Measurement of GFP-LC3

punctae

was performed by confocal microscopy on confluent HeLa

GFP-LC3

cells (

t

test,

P

-value < 0.05). Cells with more than five LC3

punctae

were considered autophagic cells.

The confocal results were in accordance with the increased amount of LC3-II in

PACSIN2

KD cells found by immunoblotting, and taken together, these results provide experimental evidence so far lacking on the involvement of PACSIN2 in the autophagy machinery and describe the direction of this effect, confirming the hypothesis generated by the agnostic approaches used in previous studies.

PACSIN2

KD alters the first phases of the autophagic flux

To understand the potential mechanism on the basis of

PACSIN2

regulation of the autophagic flux, LC3-II and SQSTM1/P62 concentrations were evaluated in both NALM6 and LS180 cell lines in the presence of 30 μM chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor that impairs the late stage of the autophagic flux, blocking the process when autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes. As expected, 4 h of chloroquine treatment increased LC3-II in both MOCK and KD cell lines, but LC3-II amount was significantly higher in cells with

PACSIN2

KD compared with MOCK in both NALM6 (fold change 1.5 ± 0.13,

P

= 0.020,

Fig 3A

) and LS180 (fold change 0.93 ± 0.03,

P

= 0.035,

Fig 3B

) cells, suggesting that PACSIN2 could inhibit autophagy acting at the beginning of the autophagic flux. To evaluate the possible impact of chloroquine on SQSTM1/P62, we treated cells with this autophagic inhibitor for 24 h. Chloroquine treatment increased SQSTM1/P62 amount both in NALM6 KD and in LS180 KD cells (fold change NALM6: 1.57 ± 0.1,

P

= 0.047,

Fig 3C

; LS180: 3.94 ± 1.8,

P

= 0.046,

Fig 3D

) and not in NALM6 and LS180 MOCK cells, supporting the hypothesis that PACSIN2 could play a role in the first phases of autophagy.

Higher inflammation and autophagy levels correspond to lower

PACSIN2

gene expression and protein concentrations in colon samples of IBD pediatric patients

Because impaired autophagy has been related to the development of pathological conditions, such as IBD, we evaluated the PACSIN2 gene and protein expression levels in inflamed and non-inflamed colon biopsies of IBD pediatric patients at diagnosis. In inflamed tissues, lower amount of both PACSIN2 mRNA (fold change 0.65 ± 0.63,

P

= 0.0084,

Fig 5A

) and protein (fold change −0.38 ± 0.12,

P

= 0.017,

Fig 5B

) levels and higher amount of LC3-II protein (fold change 1.32 ± 0.04,

P

= 0.024,

Fig 5B

) were observed compared with non-inflamed tissues. Furthermore, these results were confirmed by a correlation analysis performed on these intestinal samples (Pearson’s r = −0.83, −0.97% to −0.3 95% confidence interval,

P

= 0.011,

Fig S4

), showing an inverse correlation between PACSIN2 amount and autophagy levels, supporting the results observed in cell lines, and associating reduced PACSIN2 with increased autophagy. To evaluate the possible impact of the immune system cells, which could be infiltrated in the intestinal biopsies, interfering with the intestinal biopsy results,

PACSIN2

levels were analyzed and compared in six samples of intestinal organoids and in six whole blood samples of IBD pediatric patients; no statistically significant differences in the

PACSIN2

amount were detected (

Fig S5A

). Consistently, similar PACSIN2 transcriptional levels were found analyzing intestinal biopsy cells and also specific intestinal biopsy–derived cell types, such as colon endothelium and fibroblast, compared with many cell types of the immunity system using the “IBD Transcriptome and Metatranscriptome Meta-Analysis” (IBD TaMMA) database (

Zhu et al, 2018

) (

Fig S5B

).

PACSIN2 protein expression level in patients of the same cohort is decreased (n = 6,

test,

P

= 0.024). These results indicate an inverse correlation between PACSIN2 and autophagy levels, supporting the results observed in cell lines.

PACSIN2 presents a LIR domain responsible for a protein–protein interaction with LC3

The examination of the primary structure for PACSIN2 protein (

Fig S6

) using the iLIR database

35

revealed the presence of one LIR domain (D-D-F-E-K-I), suggesting a potential physical interaction between PACSIN2 and LC3, a key protein in autophagosome formation and elongation. To determine whether PACSIN2 interacts with LC3, we performed co-immunoprecipitations between LC3 and PACSIN2 in NALM6 and LS180 cells under basal conditions. Immunoblotting analysis showed that PACSIN2 binds to LC3-II in both NALM6 (

Fig 6A

) and LS180 (

Fig 6B

) cells. In NALM6, experiments were performed also after chloroquine treatment to increase the available LC3 amount. These results confirmed the formation of a complex between PACSIN2 and LC3, consistent with the hypothesis that PACSIN2 could play its role in the first phases of the autophagic flux.

The LIR motif (D-D-F-E-K-I) was mutated to evaluate its contribution to PACSIN2 protein–protein interaction with LC3 (mutated LIR motif: D-D-A-E-K-A).

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments performed with cellular lysates from NALM6 and LS180 cells (n = 3). PACSIN2 and LC3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-PACSIN2 or anti-LC3 specific antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Co-IP performed with IgG was included as a control of specificity. INPUT is shown to assess the presence of the proteins of interest within the cellular lysates.

Source data are available for this figure.

Source Data for Figure 6

To further demonstrate that the LIR domain of PACSIN2 is responsible for the protein–protein interaction between PACSIN2 and LC3-II, we performed the co-immunoprecipitations using LS180 transiently transfected with a plasmid coding for PACSIN2 wild-tpye isoform or one presenting PACSIN2 with a mutation in the LIR domain (both the phenylalanine in the third position of the LIR motif and the isoleucine in the last position of the LIR domain were substituted with alanine); cells transfected with an empty vector were used as a control. Results showed that by immunoprecipitating the mutated isoform of PACSIN2, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated LC3-II was lower (

Fig 6C

), confirming the hypothesis that the LIR motif plays a crucial role in the interaction between these two proteins.

PACSIN2

KD impact on unfolded protein stress response evaluated as tunicamycin cytotoxicity

Autophagy could be used by cells as a survival mechanism in response to many different stress sources, such as ER stress; however, elevated stress levels lead to cell death. Because

PACSIN2

KD cell lines presented an up-regulated basal autophagy level, we tested the cytotoxic effects of tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer, that stimulates precipitation of unfolded protein aggregates, resulting in an autophagy stimulation. Interestingly, NALM6 KD cells presented an increased sensitivity to tunicamycin compared with control cells (−log IC50 NALM6 MOCK versus −log IC50 NALM6 KD: 6.794 ± 0.05 M versus 7.064 ± 0.06 M,

P

= 0.0279,

Fig 7A

). LS180 cells showed higher cytotoxicity to tunicamycin compared with NALM6 (−log IC50 NALM6 MOCK: 6.794 ± 0.05 M; −log IC50 LS180 MOCK: 8.3 ± 0.15 M); however, the presence of

PACSIN2

KD did not impact on tunicamycin cytotoxicity in LS180 cells (

Fig 7B

).

NALM6 drug cytotoxicity assay to tunicamycin (−log IC50 NALM6 MOCK: 6.8 ± 0.05 M; NALM6 KD: 7.1 ± 0.06 M; NALM6 *1: 7.1 ± 0.12 M; NALM6 KD*1: 7.1 ± 0.11 M, n = 3, two-way ANOVA,

P

= 0.028) showed that NALM6 KD cells were more sensitive to this agent than control cells. No statistically significant difference in cytotoxicity was found in the presence of TPMT overexpression.

P

< 0.0001); interestingly, NALM6 KD*1 cells showed similar sensitivity to control cells, suggesting a role of PACSIN2 in TPMT activity in the presence of its overexpression.

(D)

LS180 drug cytotoxicity assay for mercaptopurine: LS180 KD cells were more sensible to mercaptopurine than control cells (−log IC50 LS180 MOCK: 5.3 ± 0.1 M; LS180 KD: 5.8 ± 0.04 M, n = 4, two-way ANOVA,

P

< 0.0001).

PACSIN2

KD impact on mercaptopurine cytotoxicity

The role of PACSIN2 in mercaptopurine cytotoxicity was investigated in the presence of TPMT overexpression. Cytotoxicity assay results showed that NALM6 with the stable TPMT overexpression (NALM6*1,

Figs S1

and

S2

) were the cells most sensitive to mercaptopurine treatment after 72 h of drug exposure and differed significantly from NALM6 MOCK (−log IC50 NALM6 *1 versus NALM6 MOCK: 6.4 ± 0.08 M versus 5.9 ± 0.04 M,

P

< 0.0001); no differences in mercaptopurine-induced cytotoxicity were detected between NALM6 MOCK and NALM6 KD cells. Interestingly, NALM6 with both stable

PACSIN2

KD and TPMT overexpression (NALM6 KD*1,

Figs S1

and

S2

) showed similar sensitivity to NALM6 MOCK, suggesting a role of PACSIN2 in TPMT activity in the presence of its overexpression (

Fig 7C

). We tested the effect of

PACSIN2

KD on mercaptopurine cytotoxicity in LS180, and interestingly, LS180 KD cells were more sensitive to mercaptopurine than control cells (−log IC50 LS180 KD: 5.8 ± 0.04 M versus LS180 MOCK: 5.3 ± 0.1 M,

P

< 0.0001,

Fig 7D

), supporting the hypothesis of a possible tissue-specific role of PACSIN2 in intestinal cells.

PACSIN2

KD counteracts mercaptopurine-induced autophagy inhibition

On the basis of the increased cytotoxicity of mercaptopurine in the intestinal cell line LS180 with

PACSIN2

KD, we investigated the potential impact of mercaptopurine treatment on autophagy, using the drug concentrations displaying statistically different cytotoxicity (1.25 and 2.5 μM). In particular, the LS180 MOCK cells showed a higher percentage of survival compared with LS180 KD cells (103.08 ± 10.36 and 70.53± 11.48 for 1.25 μM mercaptopurine and 78.39 ± 9.8 and 48.53 ± 19.34 for 2.5 μM mercaptopurine in LS180 MOCK versus LS180 KD cells, respectively,

Fig 7D

). We evaluated the amount of the autophagic marker LC3-II after 24 or 48 h of mercaptopurine treatment; as a control, we used untreated samples.

After 24 h of mercaptopurine exposure, LC3-II was decreased in LS180 MOCK cells (fold change 1.25 μM: 0.72 ± 0.05,

P

= 0.0057; 2.5 μM: 0.59 ± 0.08,

P

= 0.0037; 2.5 μM: 0.84 ± 0.02,

P

) compared with untreated cells; 48 h of mercaptopurine treatment led to LC3-II reduction in both LS180 MOCK (fold change 1.25 μM MP: 0.53 ± 0.04,

P

= 0.0003; 2.5 μM MP: 0.14 ± 0.05,

), consistent with what was observed in confluent untreated cells (

Fig 3B

).

Taken together, these immunoblotting results indicate that mercaptopurine treatment reduces autophagy levels; interestingly, this effect is less evident in

PACSIN2

KD cells and is in line with the previous observations that PACSIN2 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy.

Both mercaptopurine treatment and

PACSIN2

KD increase apoptosis in intestinal cells

We also investigated the potential impact of

PACSIN2

KD on apoptosis, after exposure of intestinal LS180 cells to mercaptopurine at 1.25 and 2.5 μM, evaluating the amount of cleaved PARP1 in intestinal LS180 cells by immunoblotting. LS180 KD cells showed increased apoptosis compared with control MOCK cells under basal condition after 24 h of cell growth (fold change 2.00 ± 0.26,

P

= 0.020,

Fig 9A

); interestingly, no statistically significant differences in cleaved PARP1 amount between LS180 MOCK and LS180 KD cells were detected after 48 h of cell growth without mercaptopurine treatment, indicating the presence of a similar apoptotic level in both cell lines at this time point. Treatment with 1.25 μM mercaptopurine for 24 h reduced apoptosis in both LS180 MOCK (fold change 0.32 ± 0.02,

P

< 0.0001) and LS180 KD (fold change 1.25 μM: 0.95 ± 0.07,

P

= 0.019) cells, compared with untreated controls, whereas exposure to 2.5 μM mercaptopurine increased apoptosis both in LS180 MOCK (fold change 5.21 ± 0.54,

P

= 0.0014,

Fig 9A

) and in LS180 KD (fold change 12.3 ± 0.51,

P

< 0.0001,

Fig 9A

) cells. Interestingly, consistently higher apoptosis was detected in LS180 KD cells exposed to mercaptopurine, compared with MOCK (fold change 1.25 μM: 2.97 ± 0.31,

P

= 0.001; 2.5 μM: 2.41 ± 0.2,

P

= 0.0007,

Fig 9A

) at 24 h. Furthermore, after 48 h of 2.5 μM mercaptopurine exposure, an increased apoptotic level was detected in LS180 KD cells (fold change 3.25 ± 0.42,

P

= 0.050) compared with the untreated samples, indicating higher apoptosis in LS180 KD cells at this time point.

Figure 9.

Mercaptopurine effects on apoptosis.

Immunoblotting results of total and cleaved PARP1 in LS180 cell lines under basal condition or after 24 h of 1.25 μM and 2.5 μM mercaptopurine or 5 μM doxorubicin treatment in LS180 cell lines showed that drug-induced apoptosis increases in both cell lines; interestingly, this increase was higher in the presence of

PACSIN2

KD.

(B)

Immunoblotting results of total and cleaved PARP1 in LS180 cell lines under basal condition or after 48 h of 1.25 μM and 2.5 μM mercaptopurine or 24 h of 5 μM doxorubicin treatment in LS180 cell lines showed that drug exposure induces apoptosis, especially in cells with

PACSIN2

KD. We performed immunoblotting using 10 μg of cell lysate.

(C)

DiOC6 assay results showed the percentage of the mitochondrial membrane polarization under basal condition and after 24, 48, or 72 h of mercaptopurine exposure; 24 h 5 μM doxorubicin treatment was used as a positive control. After treatment, cells with

PACSIN2

KD showed a lower mitochondrial membrane polarization, supporting the immunoblotting evidence about the potential role of mercaptopurine as an apoptotic inducer.

Because the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane is one of the crucial steps in apoptosis activation by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, we performed the DiOC6 assay to evaluate the percentage of mitochondrial membrane polarization under basal condition and after 24, 48, and 72 h of mercaptopurine treatment; as a control, we used untreated cells cultured for the same time points. Results showed that after 72 h of mercaptopurine treatment, the percentage of the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced in LS180 KD (untreated cells versus 1.25 μM: −15.95%,

P

= 0.026; untreated cells versus 2.5 μM: −26.42%,

P

< 0.0001), indicating increased apoptotic levels after mercaptopurine exposure. Interestingly, LS180 KD showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential compared with MOCK control cells after 72 h of 2.5 μM mercaptopurine treatment (MOCK versus KD: −19.69%,

P

= 0.0012), further supporting increased apoptotic levels in LS180 KD cells after mercaptopurine treatment (

Fig 9C

).

Taken together with mercaptopurine cytotoxicity analyses in LS180 cells, these results suggest a possible contribution of apoptosis in mercaptopurine cellular death that is more evident in LS180 KD cells.

PACSIN2 KD did not impact on the amount of thiopurine metabolites

On the basis of the cytotoxicity results in the intestinal LS180 cell lines, intracellular concentrations of thiopurine metabolites were evaluated through the HPLC-UV system after exposure of cells to 2.5 μM mercaptopurine for 24 and 48 h, to evaluate the effect of

PACSIN2

KD.

PACSIN2

KD did not have a significant impact on the amount of both thionucleotides (TGN) and methylated nucleotides (MMPN) (

Fig S7

). Taken together, these results suggest that

PACSIN2

KD does not affect thiopurine pharmacokinetics.

Figure S7.

Control (MOCK) and PACSIN2-silenced (KD) LS180 cells were treated with mercaptopurine 2.5 mM for 24 and 48 h. Thiopurine metabolites were extracted and analyzed by HPLC.

Analysis of thioguanine nucleotide: the presence of

PACSIN2

KD and the timing of mercaptopurine exposure did not impact on thioguanine nucleotide amount.

(B)

Analysis of methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (MMPN): the timing of mercaptopurine exposure reduced MMPN levels in both LS180 MOCK and LS180 KD cells, but this difference reached a statistically significant level only in LS180 MOCK cells (

P

= 0.037, two-way ANOVA). The silencing of

PACSIN2

did not impact on MMPN levels.

PACSIN2 alters TPMT concentrations through a mechanism different from autophagy

Because PACSIN2 is capable of modulating the level of TPMT activity, we wanted to investigate whether autophagy could be the molecular mechanism on the basis of these observations. We first determined whether the turnover of TPMT*1 was increased in NALM6 KD*1 cells (

Fig 10

). Cells were incubated for different times with the mRNA translation inhibitor cycloheximide. The basal amount of PACSIN2 (t = 0) in NALM6 KD*1 (left panel) was 7% of that measured in NALM6 *1 control cells (right panel), indicating a complete KD of

PACSIN2

compared with control cells. The half-life of the residual amount of PACSIN2 in NALM6 KD*1 cells was decreased to 5 h compared with 39 h in NALM6*1 control cells. This is in accordance with immunoblotting and confocal microscopy results that showed an increased autophagy level in NALM6 KD cells. However, surprisingly, although the expression of TPMT at t = 0 in NALM6 KD*1 cells (left panel) was only 15% compared with NALM6*1 control cells (right panel), the half-life of TPMT was similar (43–59 h) in both cell lines. This indicates that the reduction of TPMT expression in NALM6 KD*1 cells is unrelated to autophagy, suggesting that PACSIN2 alters cellular TPMT protein levels via a mechanism different from its effects on autophagy.

The experiment was repeated two times obtaining consistent results. The black lines in the blots indicated a splice between lanes.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that PACSIN2 is an inhibitor of autophagy, acting at the beginning of the autophagic flux. PACSINs are proteins that functionally link actin cytoskeleton and vesicle formation by regulating tubulin polymerization, and exert their function mainly through protein–protein interactions with different substrates, such as N-WASP or dynamin. PACSINs have various biological roles, including modulation of endocytosis (

de Kreuk et al, 2011

;

Dumont & Lehtonen, 2022

) and membrane tubulation in cells such as megakaryocytes, likely contributing to platelet formation (

Shimada et al, 2010

;

Dumont & Lehtonen, 2022

). PACSIN2 presents a high sequence homology with PACSIN1, which is implicated in signaling networks that control autophagy under optimal growth conditions (

Szyniarowski et al, 2011

;

Oe et al, 2022

).

To elucidate PACSIN2 involvement in autophagy, we followed the paradigm that autophagy-related proteins, such as SQSTM1/P62 (

Mathew et al, 2009

) or ATG16L1 (

Cadwell et al, 2008

), are accumulated in autophagy-deficient cells and are reduced after induction of autophagy by stimuli such as rapamycin. Our results showed that in autophagy-deficient Atg7

−/−

MEF cells, PACSIN2 protein amount was about two times higher than in wild-tpye control MEF cells; moreover, after induction of autophagy by rapamycin, PACSIN2 concentration decreased only in autophagy-proficient Atg7

+/+

MEF cells, indicating a possible involvement of PACSIN2 in the autophagy machinery. Similarly, SQSTM1/P62 resulted accumulated in immortalized baby mouse kidney cells presenting

Beclin1

or

Atg5

knockout and therefore autophagy-deficient MEFs (

Mathew et al, 2009

), whereas ATG16L1 concentration was reduced after rapamycin exposure in autophagy-proficient MEFs (

Cadwell et al, 2008

). To investigate further the role of PACSIN2 in autophagy, we evaluated the effect of

PACSIN2

KD in different in vitro models representative of the lymphoid and intestinal tissues on the autophagic markers LC3 and SQSTM1/P62. LC3 is a key autophagy protein involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane and in autophagosome maturation; upon induction of autophagy, cytosolic LC3-I is converted to LC3-II by conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine and subsequently translocated to autophagosomal membranes (

Kabeya et al, 2004

).

Overall, increased autophagy was observed when

PACSIN2

was silenced, suggesting that this protein could be a negative modulator of autophagy. In particular, higher LC3-II levels and lower SQSTM1/P62 were detected after

PACSIN2

KD in both cell lines; consistently, recent results on HeLa cells showed higher LC3-II levels after

PACSIN1

KO, indicating a role of PACSIN1 as a negative modulator of autophagy (

Oe et al, 2022

); moreover, a similar approach was used in a previous study on osteosarcoma U2OS cells and MEF cells transfected with siRNA for silencing

BAP31

, an ER membrane protein acting as autophagic negative modulator, that showed a higher amount of LC3-II protein expression level and LC3-GFP

punctae

(

Machihara & Namba, 2019

). The human protein Atlas (Human Protein Atlas

proteinatlas.org

) (

Uhlén et al, 2015

) showed a higher LC3 expression in intestine compared with lymphoid tissue, which could be explained by a different epigenetic control (

Lee & Lee, 2016

). Consistently, our immunoblotting results for LC3 indicated a higher autophagy basal level in LS180 cells compared with NALM6. Interestingly, a higher LC3-I amount after

PACSIN2

KD was detected in NALM6 cells and not in LS180 cells. The higher LC3-I conversion to LC3-II in NALM6 KD cells because of autophagosome formation might stimulate the transcription of LC3, leading to a statistically significant increased level of LC3-I (

Zhu et al, 2018

;

Di Malta et al, 2019

).

In the intestine, autophagy plays a role in the prevention of inflammation and altered autophagy levels have been associated with IBD (

Lapaquette et al, 2015

;

Shao et al, 2021

). Interestingly, both PACSIN2 gene expression and protein concentrations were decreased in the presence of higher autophagy levels in inflamed colon samples from a cohort of pediatric IBD patients, supporting the inverse correlation between PACSIN2 amount and autophagy levels. Consistently, a recent study identified an increased amount of the autophagy protein Atg10 in colon biopsies of IBD patients compared with healthy donors (

Abbasi Teshnizi et al, 2021

). The presence of disrupted autophagy is considered a contributing factor for IBD pathogenesis (

Iida et al, 2017

), and also, different polymorphisms in autophagy genes have been associated with pediatric IBD onset through genome-wide association studies (

Khor et al, 2011

;

Iida et al, 2017

). From a clinical point of view, the drug-mediated autophagy modulation is considered a promising mechanism for IBD clinical management, and different drugs, involved in autophagy modulation, are currently under clinical trial (

Azzman, 2019

;

Retnakumar & Muller, 2019

). Because PACSIN2 is a negative autophagy modulator, it would be interesting to investigate whether PACSIN2 targeting and modulation by a small molecule could affect autophagy in intestinal models and result beneficial for IBD patients. In order to understand the mechanisms by which

PACSIN2

KD causes LC3-II to increase and identify the step of autophagic flux where PACSIN2 is involved, we blocked the last phases of the autophagic process by chloroquine treatment (

Jiang & Mizushima, 2015

;

Yoshii & Mizushima, 2017

). A further increase in autophagy in

PACSIN2

KD cells treated with chloroquine was documented, suggesting that PACSIN2 impairs the autophagic flux during the early phases and does not cause a defect in lysosomal degradation (

Yoshii & Mizushima, 2017

). A similar result was observed by Machihara and collaborators that exposed U2OS cells knocked out for

BAP31

to bafilomycin A1, a substance with the same mechanism of action of chloroquine (i.e., autophagosome–lysosome fusion blockage (

Fedele & Proud, 2020

)) bafilomycin A1 treatment, increased LC3-II particularly in cells without

BAP31

(

Machihara & Namba, 2019

).

Different autophagy modulators interact with LC3 (

Mizushima et al, 2010

;

Birgisdottir et al, 2013

;

Chun & Kim, 2018

). PACSIN2 protein shows different interacting region domains, responsible for a physical interaction with other proteins, such as Rac-1, Cobll1, and SH3BP1, that modulate different cellular biological processes and impacts on tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity in

in vitro

models (

de Kreuk et al, 2011

;

Park et al, 2022

). Interestingly, we found that PACSIN2 presents a LIR domain in its N-terminal amino acid sequence, responsible for a physical interaction with LC3 that may permit to exert PACSIN2 regulation on autophagy. Consistently,

Pankiv et al (2007)

identified a LIR motif on SQSTM1/P62 primary protein sequence and demonstrated that it is fundamental for the binding to LC3. In particular, the binding between SQSTM1/P62 and LC3 is mediated by a 22-residue sequence in the N-terminal region of the SQSTM1/P62 protein and contains an evolutionarily conserved motif (D-D-W-T-H-L), presenting an aromatic amino acid in the central position and an aliphatic amino acid in the last position of the motif, similar to the LIR motif of PACSIN2, that presents amino acids with the same characteristics in the third and in the last position of the domain (

Pankiv et al, 2007

). Many different autophagic receptors, such as NBR1, FYCO1, NIX, PLEKHM1, and JIP1, involved in the autophagy regulation, present a LIR domain that represents the fundamental molecular mechanisms through which these proteins modulate autophagy (

Novak et al, 2010

;

Rozenknop et al, 2011

;

Fu et al, 2014

;

Olsvik et al, 2015

;

McEwan et al, 2015

).

Autophagy could be used by cells as a survival mechanism in response to many different stress sources, such as ER stress (

Ogata et al, 2006

); however, in elevated stress conditions, autophagy may contribute to cell death (

Liu et al, 2017

). The cytotoxicity assay results of tunicamycin showed a higher cytotoxic effect of this compound on LS180 cells compared with NALM6 cells; consistently, the intestinal LS180 cells presented a higher basal autophagy level compared with NALM6, and the exposure to tunicamycin, which increases cellular stress, might induce a further cell death both in LS180 MOCK and in KD cells, not permitting to detect the possible effect of

PACSIN2

KD in this intestinal model. The effect of

PACSIN2

KD after tunicamycin exposure was observed in NALM6 cells: NALM6 KD cells presented an increased sensitivity to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin compared with control cells, probably because the loss of

PACSIN2

increased autophagy and the cell exposure to a further stress source, such as tunicamycin treatment, affected in a significant way the cell vitality. The presence of unfolded proteins stimulates ER stress response, activating the unfolded protein response pathway, leading to the induction of mTORC1, an autophagy negative regulator that stimulates SQSTM1/P62 accumulation (

Guha et al, 2017

). A previous study performed on wild-type (SQSTM1/P62

+/+

) and SQSTM1/P62-deficient (SQSTM1/P62

−/−

) MEF cells treated with tunicamycin found that the absence of SQSTM1/P62 stimulates apoptotic cell death (

Park et al, 2016

). Consistently, our results showed that NALM6 KD cells have higher autophagy levels, associated with decreased SQSTM1/P62 amount and increased tunicamycin sensitivity.

Our observation that TPMT protein concentrations were reduced in

PACSIN2

KD cells is concordant with our previous reports that PACSIN2 modulates TPMT activity in patients with ALL (

Stocco et al, 2012

). Indeed, we observed also that TPMT overexpression in NALM6 cells increased mercaptopurine sensitivity, as described before. In particular, this higher sensitivity in NALM6*1 cells compared with MOCK is due to the supra-physiological accumulation of methylated metabolites, which occurs

in vitro

upon TPMT overexpression (

Dervieux et al, 2001

). Interestingly, the presence of

PACSIN2

KD was able to rescue this effect, supporting the influence of PACSIN2 on TPMT activity, previously demonstrated both in these cell lines and in ALL pediatric patients (

Stocco et al, 2012

). However, although

PACSIN2

KD consistently lowers the cellular concentration of TPMT*1 protein, the degradation of TPMT*1 is not affected by the induction of autophagy. This result is concordant with previous reports, which showed that TPMT is targeted for degradation by the proteasome rather than autophagy (

Tai et al, 1999

;

Li et al, 2008

). In contrast, the half-life of residual PACSIN2 is greatly reduced after its KD, likely because of the demonstrated increased autophagy in

PACSIN2

KD. Interestingly, the HPLC-UV analysis showed that

PACSIN2

KD did not affect concentraionts of thiopurine metabolites, indicating that PACSIN2 is not able to affect thiopurines pharmacokinetics, but rather their pharmacodynamics.

We previously reported that

PACSIN2

variants increased the severity of gastrointestinal toxicity during consolidation therapy for ALL (

Stocco et al, 2012

). Interestingly,

PACSIN2

KD increased significantly mercaptopurine sensitivity in intestinal cell lines but not in leukemia cell lines, suggesting a tissue-specific effect of PACSIN2 in the intestine; however, further investigations are needed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms on the basis of the biological function of PACSIN2 in different tissues. PACSIN2 was also reported to interact directly with Rac-1, a protein whose inhibition by thiopurine’s active metabolites has been involved in thiopurine’s mechanism of cytotoxicity (

de Kreuk et al, 2011

). Therefore, the interaction between PACSIN2 effects on autophagy and Rac-1 inhibition by thiopurines may govern thiopurine effects on cell lines exposed to these drugs and should be further explored. To investigate the possible tissue-specific role of PACSIN2 in the intestine, we evaluated autophagy and apoptosis levels after mercaptopurine treatment and found that mercaptopurine increased apoptosis and, surprisingly, reduced autophagy in LS180 intestinal cells. This result on autophagy is in contrast with a previous study performed on other stabilized intestinal cell lines (HT29 cells), which found increased LC3-II levels after mercaptopurine exposure. However, Chaabane and collaborators evaluated autophagy after cell exposure to higher concentrations of mercaptopurine (50 μM mercaptopurine for 24 h) compared with the drug concentrations we used (1.25 and 2.5 μM) in our treatment protocol: indeed, after exposure to mercaptopurine, cells were grown without treatment for 72 h and then analyzed (

Chaabane & Appell, 2016

). The replacement of medium with drug with a fresh medium could be a source of energy that may stimulate the activation of survival mechanisms, such as autophagy. From a clinical point of view, the mercaptopurine concentrations used in the current study were more therapeutically relevant compared with those used in Chaabane’s study; moreover, the intestinal

in vitro

model LS180 used in the current study is commonly considered a good model to investigate the effects of the intestinal drug metabolism and to test the cytotoxic effect of drugs (

van de Kerkhof et al, 2007

).

Autophagy can induce or block apoptosis depending on the type of cell, nature, and duration of the stimulus (

Xie et al, 2020

). Molecular mechanisms on the basis of the cross-talk between the two pathways remain unclear because the interconnection between autophagy and apoptosis may occur at different stages and may involve different molecules such as Beclin1, Bcl-2, PINK1, and SQSTM1/P62 (

Djavaheri-Mergny et al, 2010

;

Zhang et al, 2018

;

Wang et al, 2019

;

Zhu et al, 2021

). Our results showed that in the presence of mercaptopurine, the higher autophagy levels because of the lack of

PACSIN2

promote apoptosis, leading to increased drug sensitivity in LS180 KD cells compared with LS180 MOCK. The direct correlation between autophagy and apoptotic cell death had been already reported in literature for other compounds and

in vitro

models. It is difficult to identify the specific molecular mechanism of PACSIN2 in the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis, but we hypothesize that SQSTM1/P62 could be involved in this interplay, because it has been demonstrated that the increased amount of this protein in the presence of lower autophagy levels leads to apoptosis induction (

Zhu et al, 2021

).

Although the results about the inverse correlation between PACSIN2 and autophagy levels are encouraging and consistent between cell lines and intestinal biopsies, the evaluation only

ex vivo

of the association and

in vitro

of the causality between PACSIN2 amount and autophagy levels and the lack of

in vivo

assessment of the causality represent limitations of the study and future experiments need to be planned accordingly. Another limitation of the current study is that although we demonstrated that PACSIN2 modulates both autophagy and TPMT protein concentration, we did not observe an influence on TPMT protein degradation. Therefore, other molecular mechanisms must be considered, such as direct modulation of TPMT mRNA concentration by

PACSIN2

, consistent with our previous studies showing that

PACSIN2

KD is associated with reduced TPMT protein concentration and TPMT mRNA levels (

Stocco et al, 2012

). This hypothesis needs to be evaluated by further studies.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time a clear role of PACSIN2 as an inhibitor of autophagy, putatively through inhibition of autophagosome formation by a protein–protein interaction with LC3-II mediated by a LIR motif present in the PACSIN2 sequence. Moreover, we provide

in vitro

evidences of the role of PACSIN2 as a modulator of mercaptopurine-induced cytotoxicity in intestinal cells, suggesting that PACSIN2-regulated autophagy might influence thiopurine sensitivity. Prospectively, these findings could be relevant for the personalization of therapy in pediatric patients needing thiopurines.

Materials and Methods

Cell lines and treatments

The following stabilized cell lines were used: (I) MEFs, both as Atg7 wild-type (Atg7

) autophagy-competent control cells and as Atg7 knockout cells (Atg7

−/−

), used as autophagy-deficient models (

Taherbhoy et al, 2011

); (II) human peripheral blood leukemia pre–B cells NALM6; (III) NALM6 presenting the forced

TPMT*1

overexpression (NALM6*1); (IV) human colon adenocarcinoma cells LS180; (V) human epithelial cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells with forced expression of GFP-LC3 (HeLa

); and (VI) murine macrophages RAW 264.7 with forced expression of GFP-LC3 (RAW

GFP-LC3

). NALM6, NALM6*1, LS180, HeLa

GFP-LC3

, and RAW

GFP-LC3

cell lines were stably engineered to knock down

PACSIN2

(KD); as a control, we used the same cell line transfected with a scramble vector (MOCK), as previously described (

Stocco et al, 2012

,

Figs S1

and

S2

). MEF, HeLa

GFP-LC3

, and RAW

GFP-LC3

cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 20 mM glutamine; NALM6 and LS180 cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 20 mM glutamine. Cells were cultured and maintained according to standard procedures.

PACSIN2 protein stability was investigated after autophagy induction by rapamycin and after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide exposure (

Cadwell et al, 2008

). The autophagic flux was evaluated by exposing cells to chloroquine, which impairs autophagosomes fusion with lysosomes (

Yoshii & Mizushima, 2017

). The effect of

PACSIN2

KD on unfolded protein response induced by tunicamycin exposure was investigated (

Park et al, 2016

). For mercaptopurine, whose toxicity on intestinal and lymphoid cells has been associated with

PACSIN2

variant (

Stocco et al, 2012

), we evaluated the effect of

PACSIN2

KD on cytotoxicity, considering also induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, cells were exposed to cycloheximide alone, to evaluate the effect of

PACSIN2

KD on TPMT protein stability (

Kao et al, 2015

). Treatments used to evaluate the impact of

PACSIN2

KD on autophagy and mercaptopurine sensitivity in different cell lines are summarized in Table S1.

Patient samples

Thirtytwo pediatric patients (mean age: 13.9 ± 0.74 years, 17 males [53.12%]; 19 of them presented Crohn’s disease [59.4%], whereas 13 were affected by ulcerative colitis [40.6%]) were enrolled at diagnosis at the Gastroenterology Unit of the Pediatric Department of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo in Trieste, Italy. Local ethical committee approval for the study was obtained. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the parents of all the participating children gave written informed consent before study participation. Biopsies were collected in 26 patients, during a diagnostic colonoscopy. Inflamed and non-inflamed tissues of 15 patients were collected in TRIzol (15596026; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for RNA isolation, whereas inflamed and non-inflamed tissues from other five patients were used for protein lysate preparation. For six IBD pediatric patients, colon biopsies were used to generate intestinal organoids: crypts embedded in Matrigel (CLS356231; Corning) were cultured and passaged as described by Jung and colleagues (

Jung et al, 2011

). From this intestinal model, the RNA was extracted and used for the gene expression analyses. Finally, for six patients the RNA deriving from whole blood was available for the gene expression analyses.

Immunoblotting

Cells were pelleted by 5-min centrifugation at room temperature at 300

g

, washed once with PBS, and lysed as follows. MEF and HeLa

GFP-LC3

cell lines were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.01% sodium azide) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (04693116001; Roche). NALM6 and LS180 cell lines were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM EDTA, supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail 1× (87786; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein quantification was performed by the Bradford analysis (B6916; Sigma-Aldrich), and absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a Microplate Reader EL311 (214891; BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Ten biopsies (five non-inflamed and five inflamed) of the intestinal tracts of pediatric patients with IBD were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail 1× (87786; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein quantification was performed by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23227; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Equal amounts of proteins (10–50 μg, as specified in the immunoblotting results in figure legends) were separated on NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris protein gels (NP0301BOX; Life Technologies) or Bolt 4–12%, Bis-Tris, 1.0 mm Mini Protein Gel (NW04122BOX; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were then transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (PB7320; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Electrophoresis Power Supply (EPS301; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubation with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-Cl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7,5) with 0.1% Tween-20 (T-TBS) for 1 h, membranes were incubated with rabbit primary antibodies against human proteins LC3 (1:1,000 dilution; ab48394; Abcam), PACSIN2 (1:100 dilution; TA325022; OriGene), GAPDH (1:500 dilution; sc20357; Santa Cruz), actin (1:3,000 dilution; ab218787; Abcam), SQSTM1/P62 (1:250 dilution; GT381; GeneTex), PARP1 (1:1,000 dilution; #9532; Cell Signaling Technology), or mouse primary antibody against human TPMT (1:500 dilution; sc-374154; Santa Cruz), followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution; AP132P; Merck) or HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000 dilution; anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked Antibody #7076; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the LiteAblot TURBO Extra Sensitive Chemiluminescent Substrate (EMP012001; Euroclone) and using photographic films (Carestream Kodak Biomax, Z373508; Merck) or with the ChemiDoc gel imaging system (Bio-Rad). Protein levels were quantified by densitometry normalized against GAPDH or actin. Signal intensities were quantified using ImageJ and normalized for the signal intensity of the loading control in the same lane.

Confocal live imaging

Because of the difficulty of performing imaging experiments in suspension cells such as NALM6, imaging experiments were performed in adherent HeLa

GFP-LC3

and RAW 264.7

GFP-LC3

cell lines to measure GFP-LC3

punctae

, considered as a gold standard assay to assess autophagosome quantity in cells (

Kabeya et al, 2004

;

Klionsky et al, 2014

). The number of autophagic cells was measured by the percentage of cells containing five or more GFP-LC3

punctae

in the same confocal field. Live-cell imaging was performed with the inverted microscope Nikon TE2000-E equipped with a confocal system C1Si (Nikon), an argon laser at 488 nm, and DPSS lasers at 404 and 561 nm (Melles Griot). Temperature was kept at 37°C and CO

2

at 5% using an environmental control chamber (In Vivo Scientific). Images were acquired on cells cultivated at 70% confluence, using a 40× objective with oil immersion.

Gene expression analysis on patients’ biopsies

Total RNA was extracted from patients’ biopsies using TRIzol reagent (15596026; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; RNA concentration and purity were evaluated using NanoDrop instrument (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (4387406; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was carried out in duplicate using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay to assess

PACSIN2

mRNA expression, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PACSIN2

expression values were normalized using the ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (

RPLP0

) as a reference gene for the intestinal biopsy samples and using actin for the samples deriving from intestinal organoids and the whole blood. Results were expressed as base 10 logarithm of the ΔCt of the relative expression (RE).

LIR identification

The examination of the primary structure for PACSIN2 protein to identify a possible LIR domain in the sequence was performed through an in silico analysis performed using the iLIR database (

Jacomin et al, 2016

). As a positive control, we performed the same analysis on SQSTM1/P62 primary sequence to identify the LIR domain present in this protein (

Pankiv et al, 2007

); finally, this in silico analysis was performed on the ABL1 primary sequence, used as a negative control.

Transient cell transfection

OmicsLink Expression-Ready ORF cDNA Vector bearing only the eGFP reporter gene (Cat# EX-EGFP-M39), and vector carrying the

PACSIN2

wild-type and mutated cDNA (Cat# CS-I2075-M39 and CS-I2075-M39-01, respectively) were purchased from GeneCopoeia.

PACSIN2

wild-type cDNA sequence (

NM_007229.3

) encoded for the protein sequence is shown in

Fig S4

. For mutated

PACSIN2

, the nucleotide sequence TTCGAGAAGATC in position 325 of the NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_007229.3N was mutated into GCAGAGAAGGCA resulting in a PACSIN2 protein with both the phenylalanine in position 109 and the isoleucine in position 112 replaced by alanine. For cell line transient transfections, plasmids were expanded using DH5α

E. coli

–competent cells grown in Luria–Bertani broth (NaCl 10 g/l, tryptone 10 g/l, and yeast extract 5 g/l) and purified using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (12362; Qiagen). Plasmid quantification was performed using NanoDrop instrument (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). LS180 MOCK cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 without antibiotics at a concentration of 1 × 10

6

cells/well; cells at 80–90% confluence were transfected with 7 μg of plasmid using 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (11668019; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2 ml of Opti-MEM (31985070; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 48 h.

Co-immunoprecipitations

Co-immunoprecipitations were performed using NALM6 cells under basal condition and after 3 h of 50 μM chloroquine exposure, thus resulting in an increased amount of available LC3. Moreover, we performed co-immunoprecipitations in LS180 MOCK cells transfected to overexpress the wild-type and mutated PACSIN2. Cells were grown for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO

2

, pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and lysed using a buffer containing 25 mM Tris–HCl, 0.5% NP-40, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol and completed with the Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (1:100; P8340; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM sodium butyrate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein quantifications were performed by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23227; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (17-0618-01; Merck) was incubated for 1 h with 4 μg of antibody anti-human LC3 IgG (ab48394; Abcam), anti-human PACSIN2 IgG (TA325022; OriGene), or rabbit IgG, polyclonal, isotype control (ab37415; Abcam), blocked for 1 h with bovine serum albumin 1 mg/ml, and then incubated for 3 h with 500 μg of cell lysates. After washing with lysis buffer, beads were eluted with sample buffer completed with 1 M dithiothreitol, boiled for 5 min at 95°C, and loaded on NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris protein precast gels (NP0301BOX; Life Technologies) and 7% Tris-Tricine gels for immunoblotting of LC3-II and PACSIN2, respectively. In LS180 cells, for immunoblotting of LC3-II we used the NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris protein precast gels (NP0301BOX; Life Technologies), whereas to detect PACSIN2 in the co-immunoprecipitation samples, we prepared 7% Tris-Tricine gels to improve separation between PACSIN2 and the heavy chains of the primary antibodies for the co-immunoprecipitations, which present similar molecular weights (PACSIN2 is detectable around 56 kD and antibody heavy chains around 55 kD).

Drug sensitivity assay

NALM6 or LS180 cell lines were seeded as 100 μl cell suspension in 96-well plates at 20,000 cells/well or 5,000 cells/well, respectively. Subsequently, 100 μl per well of the substances tested (mercaptopurine or tunicamycin) at decreasing concentrations (Table S1) was added. Plates were incubated for 72 h in a humidified incubator (5% CO

2

at 37°C) in the presence of MTT (3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, M2128; Sigma-Aldrich) 0.5 mg/ml for the last 4 h. After incubation, supernatants were removed and MTT precipitates were suspended in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide; absorbance at 570- to 630-nm wavelength was measured with a Microplate Reader EL311 (214891; BioTek Instruments). Results were expressed as percentages of survival according to the absorbance ratio between treated and untreated conditions (after blank subtraction), and EC50 values were then calculated on dose–response curves.

Mitochondrial membrane potential measurement

LS180 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/well (100 μl). After 24 h, 100 μl per well of mercaptopurine (final concentrations 1.25 and 2.5 μM) was added and incubated for 24 or 48 h; moreover, 5 μM doxorubicin for 24 h was used as a positive control. 30 min before the end of incubation, wells were washed twice with 100 μl PBS. Then, 50 nM of 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) probe in 100 μl of PBS was added to samples and incubated for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO

2

. Finally, fluorescence was detected at 485/520-nm absorption/emission wavelength using the Microplate Reader EL311 (214891; BioTek Instruments).

Thiopurine metabolite analysis

LS180 cells were seeded at 1.7 × 10

6

in 7 ml of RPMI medium and after 24 h were treated with mercaptopurine 2.5 μM for 24 or 48 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 600

g

; pellets were collected, suspended in 500 μl of Milli-Q water, vortex-mixed, frozen, and thawed to obtain lysate samples. Thiopurine metabolites were quantified using a previously described method based on the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) analysis (

Dervieux & Boulieu, 1998

).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with the software R (version 3.2.4) or PRISM (version 7.0). Associations were evaluated using a

t

test, two-way ANOVA, and Pearson’s correlation test. For all continuous variables, results are reported as means and standard error. All experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells

1

that progresses through three clinical phases: the chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blast crisis (BC).

2

The major cause of CML initiation is a translocation that results in the BCR‐ABL1 fusion gene.

3

Constitutive expression of the BCR‐ABL1 fusion tyrosine kinase enhances genomic instability. The BCR‐ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has been shown to be highly efficacious in CML treatment. However, imatinib is unable to completely eliminate CML clones due to the development of resistance and the insensitivity of primitive CML cells to the treatment.

4

,

5

Despite the development of more potent next‐generation BCR‐ABL1 TKIs including ATP and allosteric site inhibitors,

6

,

7

,

8

,

9

some patients still develop TKI resistance during BC progression in both a BCR‐ABL1 kinase‐dependent or ‐independent manner.

10

Cobll1, a negative regulator of apoptosis, is associated with lower insulin resistance.

11

,

12

Patients with CML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) possessing high Cobll1 expression have shown poor clinical outcomes.

13

,

14

Previously, we demonstrated that Cobll1 leads to the induction of TKI resistance and blastic transformation in CML.

13

In addition, Plešingerová et al. reported that patients with CLL and high Cobll1 expression but without the

IGHV

mutation exhibit unregulated B‐cell receptor signaling, impaired migration, and chemotaxis.

14

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how Cobll1 expression represses apoptotic cell death resulting in TKI resistance in CML are not fully understood.

Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 (PACSIN2) are a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic adapter protein.

15

It possesses an N‐terminal F‐BAR domain and a C‐terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. PACSIN2 is known to function in cellular migration,

16

caveolae shaping,

17

,

18

,

19

and receptor internalization.

20

,

21

PACSIN2 interacts with several endocytic proteins, including dynamin 2, neural Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein, and synaptojanin, through its SH3 domain.

22

,

23

Clinically, PACSIN2 polymorphism has been shown to be linked to drug‐induced hematological toxicity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing therapy.

24

,

25

SH3 domain‐binding protein 1 (SH3BP1) is a RhoGTPase‐activating protein that is important for the process of cell motility and cancer invasion through the regulation of the Rac1 pathway.

26

Overexpression of SH3BP1 activates the invasion and migration of cancer cells by increasing the activity of Rac1‐WAVE2 signaling in cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

27

,

28

Rac1 has been identified as an important downstream component of BCR‐ABL1 signaling and a key therapeutic target for CML.

29

,

30

Activation of the Rac1 pathway induces TKI resistance, whereas Rac1 inhibition reduces the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells resistant to TKI.

31

Here, we identified PACSIN2 as a novel binding partner of Cobll1. PACSIN2 promoted nilotinib‐induced apoptosis, which was suppressed by Cobll1 expression. Additionally, PACSIN2 binds to another SH3 domain‐binding protein, SH3BP1, thereby repressing the SH3BP1/Rac1 signaling cascade. Cobll1 preferentially competes with SH3BP1 for binding to PACSIN2, eventually releasing SH3BP1 from PACSIN2 to suppress nilotinib‐dependent apoptosis by inducing the Rac1 pathway. Likewise, reciprocal interaction among

cobll1b

,

pacsin2

, and

sh3bp1

regulates hematopoiesis during embryonic development in zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of large sets of primary CML samples showed that the expression patterns of Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 were highly correlated with the BC progression. Taken together, our studies showed that reciprocal interaction between Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 is closely linked to drug resistance and BC progression in CML. Our results suggest that the pharmacologic targeting of the Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 axis can be a novel approach to overcome TKI resistance and disease progression in CML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1

Patient samples and cell lines

A total of 100 CML samples (36 CP including NEL and CHR samples, four AP, and 60 BC) from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) were obtained from 57 CML patients. Among them, 10 patients had serial samples at CP and BC. Mononuclear cells (MCs) were isolated by Ficoll‐Paque (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) density gradient centrifugation. Samples were frozen in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in fetal bovine serum (Sigma‐Aldrich), stored in liquid nitrogen, and later thawed for analysis. All human samples were obtained from the Korea Leukemia Bank and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patient consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The full‐length cDNA clone for PACSIN2 (Clone ID: hMU008023) was purchased from the Korea Human Gene Bank. The Myc‐PACSIN2, SFB‐PACSIN2, Myc‐SH3BP1, and SFB‐SH3BP1 internal deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The full‐length cDNA clone for Rac1 (Clone ID: hMU007586) was purchased from the Korea Human Gene Bank. The wild‐type and active forms of HA‐Rac1 were generated by PCR. GST‐SH3 was also generated by PCR.

2.3

Immunoprecipitation and western blot

K562 cells were transfected with expression plasmids, as indicated in each figure legend. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in NETN buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% NP‐40) for 20 min on ice. The crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatants were incubated with streptavidin‐coated beads or protein A‐agarose‐conjugated primary antibodies. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Western blotting was conducted using the antibodies indicated in the figure legends.

2.4

Antibodies and dilution factors

The dilutions of the various antibodies for western blot analysis are as follows: anti‐Cobll1, which was previously described, 1:200; anti‐PACSIN2 (Sigma‐Aldrich, SAB1300127), 1:1000; anti‐FLAG (Sigma‐Aldrich, F3165), 1:2000; anti‐Myc (Roche, 11,814,150,001) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 1:2000; anti‐HA (Roche, 12,013,819,001), 1:2000; anti‐β‐actin (Sigma‐Aldrich, A5316), 1:5000; anti‐GFP (Clontech 632,380) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 1:2000; anti‐SH3BP1 (Proteintech, 20,541‐1‐AP), 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies specific to rabbit (Sigma‐Aldrich, A0545) or mouse (Sigma‐Aldrich, A9917) IgG were used at a dilution of 1:2000.

2.5

Cell culture

The K562 cell lines were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in a 5% CO

2

atmosphere. The human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO

2

atmosphere.

2.6

Apoptosis assay

The plasmids or siRNAs were transfected into K562 cells, as indicated in the figures. After 48 h, the transfected cells were seeded in 100‐mm culture dishes and treated with the indicated concentrations of nilotinib for 48 h. The cells were then assayed for apoptosis using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Bioscience, 556,547, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition, the apoptotic cells were analyzed by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) (BD Bioscience). Nilotinib (Sigma‐Aldrich) was reconstituted in DMSO as a 10 mM stock and stored at −20°C.

2.7

Protein purification

Genes encoding the N‐terminal regions of Cobll1 (residues 1–410; Cobll1‐NT‐f and 175–370; Cobll1‐NT), PACSIN2 SH3 domain (residues 430–486), and C‐terminal region of SH3BP1 (residues 541–701; SH3BP1‐CT) were cloned into the pGEX‐4 T‐1 and pET‐21a vectors, respectively. The recombinant vectors were transformed into

E. coli

BL21‐CodonPlus (DE3) cells, and the transformed cells were grown in LB medium and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β‐D‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P‐40 (NP40), 0.4 mM Tris(2‐carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0). For the GST‐fusion proteins (Cobll1‐NT‐f, Cobll1‐NT, and PACSIN2 SH3 domain), the proteins were loaded onto a GST column and eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 0.2 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM glutathione, pH 7.0). The GST tags were cleaved by PreScission protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or thrombin and the cleaved proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography using stepwise elution with increasing ionic strength (up to 1 M NaCl). Further purification was performed using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75/200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) with final buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 6.3). For poly‐histidine‐tagged proteins (SH3BP1‐CT), the proteins were loaded onto a Ni column and eluted by increasing concentrations of imidazole (up to 1 M imidazole). Further purification was performed using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare).

, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4). The PACSIN2 SH3 domain was immobilized on a PEG chip using amine coupling in the Reichert SR7500DC system (Reichert Technologies Life Sciences). The flow rate for ligand immobilization was 10 μl/min for 20 μg of PACSIN2 SH3 domain on the sample channel. The N‐terminal region of Cobll1 (residues 1–410; Cobll1‐NT‐f) and the C‐terminal region of SH3BP1 (residues 541–701; SH3BP1‐CT) were dissociated for 10 min after 3 min of association time.

rac1a

(Gene Tools, Philomath, OR, USA) was diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)‐treated water as a 25 ng/nL stock. Ten nanograms of cobll1b‐MO, 1 ng of pacsin2‐MO, 2.5 ng of sh3bp1‐MO, and 2.5 ng of rac1a‐MO were injected into wild‐type embryos at the one‐cell stage. The sequences of the splice‐blocking MOs were 5′‐CTTCTCCAATCAGTCGCCCTCAC‐3′ for pacsin2‐MO, 5′‐ATCATTCAAACCTTCACCTTATAGA‐3′ for sh3bp1‐MO, and 5′‐CATCTGTATTAGCTTGTTACCGTCT‐3′ for rac1a‐MO. The cDNA of

pacsin2

was synthesized using wild‐type zebrafish embryo RNA and inserted into the PCS2+ vector. Full‐length

pacsin2

was synthesized from linearized pCS2+

pacsin2

through in vitro transcription (mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit, Ambion).

Pacsin2

mRNA was injected into wild‐type embryos at the one‐cell stage. Microinjections were performed using a Femtojet 4i microinjector (Eppendorf).

RESULTS

3.1

Identification of

PACSIN2

as a novel Cobll1 binding protein

Previously, we reported that Cobll1 affects nilotinib sensitivity in CML and regulates embryonic hematopoiesis.

13

To further investigate the molecular function of Cobll1, we performed tandem affinity purification and a yeast two‐hybrid screening of a human bone marrow cDNA library with Cobll1 as a bait (Figure

S1

A). Mass spectrometric analysis identified several binding protein candidates, and 14 positive clones were recovered from the yeast two‐hybrid screening analysis (out of a total of 4.5 × 10

6

transformants). PACSIN2 was identified as the most promising Cobll1‐interacting protein with 24% of the peptides in the proteomic analysis (Figure

1A

). Additionally, 11 out of 14 clones in the yeast two‐hybrid analysis were derived from PACSIN2 (Figure

S1

B). Furthermore, we confirmed the interaction between Cobll1 and PACSIN2 through co‐immunoprecipitation using both endogenous and overexpressed Cobll1 and PACSIN2 (Figure

1B

; Figure

S1

C,D).

(H) Interaction between PACSIN2 and overexpressed Cobll1‐WT or Cobll1‐3A (3A) wherein all three proline‐rich motifs of Cobll1 have been mutated to alanine

To identify essential interaction domains in Cobll1 and PACSIN2, we expressed deletion mutants of the Cobll1 and PACSIN2 proteins in K562 cell lines and probed the interaction by co‐immunoprecipitation (Figure

1C,D

). We found that deletion of amino acids 14–368 of Cobll1 abolished its interaction with PACSIN2 (Figure

1E

), whereas amino acids 430–486 of PACSIN2, which contained the SH3 domain, were essential for the interaction with Cobll1 (Figure

1F

). The interaction between the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 and Cobll1 was further confirmed using a GST pull‐down assay (Figure

S2A

). Because the SH3 domain generally interacts with proline‐rich motifs in their respective binding partner,

32

we analyzed the availability of proline‐rich motifs in Cobll1 using the modular domain peptide interaction (modpepint) server.

33

We found that Cobll1 possesses three proline‐rich motifs in its N‐terminus (Figure

1G

; Figure

S2B

). To validate the roles of each proline‐rich motif on the binding to the SH3 domain of PACSIN2, we generated mutants in which the proline residues in one, two, or all three motifs were mutated to alanine (Figure

S2C

). Mutating all proline residues (Cobll1‐3A mutant) led to an almost complete loss of interaction with PACSIN2, whereas mutations of two motifs (Cobll1‐2A mutants) or only one proline motif (Cobll1‐1A mutants) showed no or little effect on binding compared to that of the wild‐type protein (Figure

S2D

). We further examined the role of the proline‐rich motifs of Cobll1 on interaction with PACSIN2 by co‐immunoprecipitating Cobll1 wild‐type or Cobll1‐3A mutants with PACSIN2 and found that Cobll1 failed to bind to PACSIN2 without proline‐rich motifs (Figure

1H

). Taken together, these results indicate that Cobll1 strongly binds to the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 through its proline‐rich motifs.

3.2

Interaction between Cobll1 and

PACSIN2

regulates nilotinib resistance

Due to the effects of Cobll1 on drug sensitivity in CML, we further validated the function of PACSIN2 on nilotinib resistance by evaluating the apoptotic index using fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figure

S3

). First, the depletion of PACSIN2 using siRNAs in K562 cells yielded lower nilotinib‐induced apoptosis than in the controls (Figure

2A

). Knockdown efficiency of PACSIN2 siRNA without off target effects was confirmed by the rescue of siRNA effects through the expression of siRNA‐resistant PACSIN2 (Figure

S4

). PACSIN2 overexpression increased apoptosis by approximately twofold, whereas Cobll1 overexpression decreased nilotinib‐induced apoptosis (Figure

2B

). Moreover, cells expressing both PACSIN2 and Cobll1 had less apoptosis than PACSIN2‐overexpressing cells, suggesting that reciprocal interaction between PACSIN2 and Cobll1 is crucial for regulating TKI sensitivity (Figure

2C

). Thus, we further examined whether the direct interaction between Cobll1 and PACSIN2 influences nilotinib‐induced apoptosis in CML. While the expression of full‐length Cobll1 reduced PACSIN2‐induced apoptosis to the control level, overexpression of a PACSIN2‐interaction‐defective form of Cobll1 protein D1 (described in Figure

1C

) was dispensable for the apoptotic events induced by PACSIN2 overexpression (Figure

2C

). Consistently, nilotinib sensitivity was not restored by the overexpression of the Cobll1‐3A mutant (Figure

2D

). In contrast to the D1 form and the Cobll1‐3A mutant, other deleted forms of Cobll1 (D2, D3, D4, and N‐term, all of which can bind to PACSIN2), recovered cell death to the control level in the presence of PACSIN2 expression. This result suggests that Cobll1 represses PACSIN2‐induced apoptosis with nilotinib treatment via physical interaction between the two proteins.

Bar graphs showing the average of three independent experiments, with error bars indicating the SEM. Expression of Cobll1 and PACSIN2 was confirmed by western blotting images provided below each graph

To further validate the role of the PACSIN2‐Cobll1 interaction, we examined the function of the interaction‐defective PACSIN2 with Cobll1 for nilotinib sensitivity in K562 cells. Surprisingly, overexpression of the PACSIN2 D4 mutant, which lacks the SH3 domain required for Cobll1 binding (Figure

1D

), led to no significant alteration in cell death in K562 cells with nilotinib stimulation. By contrast, wild‐type or D1/D2/D3 mutants, which possess an interaction domain for Cobll1, induced apoptosis (Figure

2E

). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 is essential for inducing apoptosis with TKI treatment and for binding to Cobll1, which suppresses the PACSIN2‐dependent apoptotic process.

3.3

Identification of

SH3BP1

as a novel

PACSIN2

binding protein

According to our experimental results, the Cobll1‐binding SH3 motif of PACSIN2 is essential for the function of PACSIN2 to promote TKI‐induced apoptosis, as well as for the inhibition of this function through Cobll1 binding. Therefore, we hypothesized that another binding partner for the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 could be involved in the nilotinib‐induced apoptotic process in CML. To find the candidates, we searched for binding proteins using tandem affinity purification with PACSIN2 and found the following potential PACSIN2‐binding proteins: Cobll1, SH3BP1, ARHGAP17, TCOF1, DNM2, and WIPF2 (Figure

S5A,B

). Because SH3BP1 contains multiple proline‐rich regions, which can potentially bind to the SH3 domain (Figure

S5C

), we first examined whether SH3BP1 can interact with PACSIN2 by binding to the SH3 motif. SH3BP1 was co‐immunoprecipitated by full‐length PACSIN2 but not by the PACSIN2 D4 mutant lacking the SH domain, suggesting that the interaction requires the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 (Figure

3A

). We confirmed the interaction between PACSIN2 and SH3BP1 through an immunoprecipitation assay using endogenous proteins and a GST pull‐down assay (Figure

3B

; Figure

S5D

).

(G) GST pull‐down assay using GST‐Rac1 and cell lysates transfected with or without Cobll1 expression plasmid

To closely dissect the PACSIN2 binding regions on SH3BP1, we analyzed possible proline‐rich motifs of SH3BP1 using the MoDPepInt server, the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, and BLAST

33

,

34

and found five potential motifs within SH3BP1 (Figure

S5C,E

). To identify which proline‐rich motif of SH3BP1 is required for PACSIN2 binding, we generated SH3BP1 mutant proteins with deletions or point mutations incorporated into each proline‐rich motif (Figure

S5F

). GST pull‐down assays showed that the SH3BP1 DPD2 mutant, wherein all five available proline‐rich motifs were mutated, failed to interact with the PACSIN2 SH3 domain. All the other SH3BP1 mutants possessing at least one proline‐rich motif were bound to the SH3 domain of PACSIN2 (Figure

S5G

). Moreover, PACSIN2 was co‐immunoprecipitated with wild‐type SH3BP1 but not with the DPD2 mutant (Figure

3C

). Collectively, our data indicate that the proline‐rich motifs of SH3BP1 are crucial for its interaction with PACSIN2 and that each motif is sufficient to interact with the SH3 domain of PACSIN2.

3.4

SH3BP1

induces nilotinib resistance

The RhoGTPase‐activating protein SH3BP1 activates Rac1‐WAVE2 signaling in diverse types of cancer.

27

,

28

Rac1 is well known for its function related to TKI resistance and as a key component of the therapeutic target for CML.

31

To identify whether SH3BP1 and downstream Rac1 signaling are involved in drug sensitivity in CML, we investigated the role of SH3BP1 and Rac1 in nilotinib resistance using the K562 cell line. In contrast to PACSIN2, SH3BP1 overexpression decreased nilotinib‐induced apoptosis by approximately threefold (Figure

3D

), while SH3BP1 depletion using siRNA increased apoptosis rate by approximately twofold (Figure

3E

). Similarly, overexpression of wild‐type Rac1 or the active form of Rac1 (Rac1 V12) alone reduced nilotinib‐induced apoptosis while PACSIN2 expression restored the apoptosis level in the presence of Rac1 (Figure

3F

). Moreover, Cobll1 overexpression, which suppresses PACSIN2‐dependent apoptosis with nilotinib treatment, subsequently activated Rac1 (Figure

3G

). Taken together, these results suggest that SH3BP1/Rac1 signaling induces CML drug resistance, which can be repressed by PACSIN2.

3.5

Cobll1 and

SH3BP1

competes for binding to

PACSIN2

As the PACSIN2 SH3 domain is bound to proline‐rich motifs of both SH3BP1 and Cobll1, we compared the binding affinities of the three proteins using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. The SPR results indicated that the PACSIN2 SH3 domain bound to the N‐terminal region of Cobll1 (residues 1–410; Cobll1‐NT‐f) and the C‐terminal region of SH3BP1 containing all proline‐rich motifs (residues 541–701; SH3BP1‐CT) with dissociation constants (K

d

) of 25.8 nM and 2.2 μM, respectively. PACSIN2 SH3 domain exhibited an approximately 85‐fold higher binding affinity for the Cobll1‐NT‐f than for SH3BP1‐CT (Figure

4A,B

). Through further NMR assessment, the

N Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the

15

N‐labeled PACSIN2 SH3 domain in the presence of equimolar ratios of both Cobll1‐NT and SH3BP1‐CT (i.e., PACSIN2 SH3:Cobll1‐NT:SH3BP1‐CT = 1:1:1) was measured and compared to the spectra of PACSIN2 SH3 domain in complex with Cobll1‐NT or SH3BP1‐CT (Figure

4C

). Because Cobll1 and SH3BP1 demonstrated similar binding patterns for the PACSIN2 SH3 domain (Figure

S6

), the majority of peaks for the PACSIN2 SH3 domain in the presence of Cobll1‐NT or SH3BP1‐CT overlapped. However, the chemical shifts of the nonoverlapping residues, such as G463, G467, L445, and E441 of the PACSIN2 SH3 domain, with both Cobll1‐NT and SH3BP1‐CT (green color) were much closer to those with Cobll1‐NT alone (red color) than to those with SH3BP1‐CT alone (blue color). These results suggest that the PACSIN2 SH3 domain is preferentially bound to Cobll1‐NT than to SH3BP1‐CT (Figure

4C

).

(C) Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy spectra of the PACSIN2 SH3 domain in the presence of SH3BP1‐CT (blue), Cobll1‐NT (red), and both proteins (green).

All graphs show the percentage of apoptotic cells as the average of three independent experiments, with error bars indicating the SEM. Expression of the indicated proteins was confirmed by western blotting

The competitive binding of Cobll1 and SH3BP1 to PACSIN2 was further investigated by conducting a replacement titration (Figure

S7A,B

). The chemical shifts of the Y435, K455, Q462, and Q463 residues of the PACSIN2 SH3 domain bound to SH3BP1‐CT at the saturation point (blue color) were gradually shifted by the addition of increasing concentrations of Cobll1‐NT (Figure

S7C

, upper panel). By contrast, no (K455 and Q462) or a smaller (Y435 and G463) change in chemical shift was observed by the addition of SH3BP1‐CT to the Cobll1‐NT‐PACSIN2 complex (Figure

S7C

, lower panel). The replacement titration results were consistent with the PACSIN2 SH3 domain having a stronger binding affinity for Cobll1‐NT than SH3BP1‐CT. We further confirmed that the expression of the full‐length or the N‐terminus of Cobll1 inhibited the binding between PACSIN2 and SH3BP1 using immunoprecipitation assays (Figure

4D,E

). Collectively, our data suggest that the PACSIN2 SH3 domain preferentially interacts with proline‐rich motifs of Cobll1, compared with SH3BP1.

3.6

PACSIN2

and

SH3BP1

regulate myelopoiesis

Due to the requirement of zebrafish

cobll1b

for normal myelopoiesis,

13

we hypothesized that PACSIN2 and SH3BP1 are involved in hematopoiesis. To assess the function of PACSIN2 and SH3BP1 in myelopoiesis, we performed whole‐mount in situ hybridization using the myeloid marker

mpx

in zebrafish embryos at 28 hours postfertilization (hpf). Interestingly, the ectopic expression of

pacsin2

via mRNA injection diminished the number of

mpx

‐positive primitive myeloid cells. However, embryonic myelopoiesis was not altered in the

pacsin2

morphants, wherein

pacsin2

expression was inhibited by antisense morpholino (MO) oligonucleotides injection (Figure

5A

and Figure

S8A–C

). Similarly, the morphants of both

sh3bp1

and

rac1a

had less myeloid cells than the controls (Figure

5B

and Figure

S8D

). Collectively, these results suggest that the SH3BP1/Rac1a signaling cascade positively regulates myelopoiesis during zebrafish embryogenesis while PACSIN2 negatively regulates myeloid development.

Based on the binding studies showing that Cobll1 has a higher binding affinity to PACSIN2 than SH3BP1, we next hypothesized that endogenous Cobll1b constitutively binds to PACSIN2 to block its inhibition of the SH3BP1/Rac1a pathway during zebrafish myelopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, we co‐injected MOs against

cobll1b

and

pacsin2

to eliminate the effect of both

cobll1b

and

pacsin2

. As previously described, the cobll1b MO‐injected group showed a significant reduction in

mpx

‐positive cells at 28 hpf.

13

By contrast, the simultaneous knockdown of

pacsin2

and

cobll1b

restored myeloid formation (Figure

5C

), suggesting that the loss of

cobll1b

expression causes PACSIN2 to inhibit the SH3BP1/Rac1a pathway and leads to the perturbation of normal hematopoiesis. Taken together, these results suggested that a reciprocal regulatory network among Cobll1b, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 controls embryonic hematopoiesis in vertebrates using the same mechanism that regulates nilotinib resistance in CML.

3.7

Clinical correlation of Cobll1/

PACSIN2

/

SH3BP1

expression

Previously, we showed that Cobll1 is highly upregulated in CML patients with BC progression, compared with those at the CP.

13

Because Cobll1 activates the Rac1 pathway by regulating the PACSIN2–SH3BP1 interaction at the cellular and organismal level, we next investigated the correlated expression patterns among Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 in clinical samples. We first determined the expression levels of three proteins in the paired serial samples from 20 patients with CML. Interestingly, 13 patients at the BC phase showed positive expression with distinct combinatorial patterns of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 while no patients at the CP exhibited any expression of these three proteins (Figure

6A

; Figure

S9

A). In addition, we further examined the expression of these proteins using the samples obtained from unpaired patient groups. Similar expression patterns of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 were observed in 18 patients among 31 BC patients, whereas no patients at the CP showed any expression of these proteins (Figure

6B

; Figure

S9

B). Of 60 samples obtained from 51 BC patients, 36 showed the expression of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 in two major patterns, Cobll1+/SH3BP1+ (13/36), and Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+ (16/36); however, the other 24 BC samples and all 36 CP samples showed no expression of any of these proteins (Figure

6C

), suggesting that expression of both Cobll1 and SH3BP1 is linked to BC progression.

The blasts possess small‐ to medium‐sized nuclei with a coarse chromatin pattern and a scanty amount of cytoplasm. Original magnification, x400. Black arrows indicate the blasts. (F) GST pull‐down assays showed Rac1 activity in CP and BC samples from two patients (#1744 with expression of Cobll1 and SH3BP1, and #1919 with no expression of Cobll1, SH3BP1, or PACSIN2). Each sample number with the pound symbol (#) indicates the anonymous patient number from the Asia CML registry. AP, accelerated phase; BC: blast crisis; CHR, complete hematologic response; CP, chronic phase; MyBC, myeloid blast crisis; NEL, no evidence of leukemia

To further examine the correlation of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 with BC progression, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 51 patients at the BC phase based on distinct combinatorial expression patterns of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 including bone marrow blast percentage. Interestingly, blast percentage was significantly higher in BC patients expressing Cobll1+/SH3BP1+ and Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+ than in those with no expression (Cobll1−/PACSIN2−/SH3BP1−) (Table

1

; Figure

6D

). Representative images of Giemsa‐staining showed no morphological alteration in the blasts between the BC patients with either Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+ or no expression, while the blast percentage is still higher in the patients expressing Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+ (Figure

6E

). The expression patterns of three proteins do not appear to be linked to the development of a specific type of BC‐CML between lymphoid BC and myeloid BC (Figure

S9C

). By contrast, the expression of BCR‐ABL1 showed no alteration between each patient group with different expression patterns (Table

1

). In summary, these clinical data suggest that ectopic expression of Cobll1 and SH3BP1 can induce severe BC progression with higher blast percentage independent of BCR‐ABL.

Finally, to confirm whether Rac1 is regulated by the Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 pathway during CML progression, we examined the activity of Rac1 in samples from patients at the BC phase. We selected a patient sample (#1744) with Cobll1/SH3BP1 expression and a patient sample (#1919) without any Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 expression in BC cells (Figure

6A

). Consistent with primary cell and animal model studies, Rac1 activity was increased in BC cells of patient expressing Cobll1/SH3BP1 but not in patient without any Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 expression, suggesting that the Rac1 pathway is only activated by an exclusive activation of both SH3BP1 and Cobll1 in patients with CML (Figure

6F

). Taken together, our clinical analysis findings demonstrated that Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 expression is correlated to BC progression in CML. In particular, Cobll1 and SH3BP1 activation leads to much poorer BC progression through the Rac1 pathway, independent of BCR/ABL1 (Figure

7

).

DISCUSSION

CML development is generally caused by expression of BCR‐ABL1 fusion protein, which leads to genomic instability, and the malignant progression from the CP to the BC phase occurs in a BCR‐ABL1‐dependent or ‐independent manner.

35

,

36

Previously, our study revealed that the oncogenic protein Cobll1 is linked to TKI resistance and BC transformation in CML, independent of BCR‐ABL1 expression.

13

In the present study, we found that the overexpression of PACSIN2, a novel functional binding partner of Cobll1, increased nilotinib sensitivity in K562 cells. The SH3 domain of PACSIN2 binds to the proline‐rich regions located at the N‐terminus of Cobll1, and both binding motifs are crucial for their antagonistic functions in TKI resistance. Likewise, the identical SH3 motif of PACSIN2 binds to the proline‐rich domains of SH3BP1, and SH3BP1 overexpression decreases the susceptibility of CML to nilotinib similar to the function of Cobll1. PACSIN2 interacts competitively with Cobll1 or SH3BP1 with higher affinity for Cobll1, and their reciprocal interaction eventually regulates TKI resistance, as well as normal hematopoiesis. More importantly, in the primary cells of 51 BC‐transformed patients with CML, the expression patterns of Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 were significantly associated with blast cell percentage. While none of the three proteins were expressed at the CP, more than half of BC patients showed expression of both Cobll1 and SH3BP1 with two representative patterns (Cobll1+/SH3BP1+ and Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+) These data suggest that the interactions between Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 are closely linked to BC transformation, TKI resistance, and sustained hematopoiesis.

Although Cobll1 has been shown to be linked to diverse processes of cancer formation and progression including CML, CLL, and prostate cancer,

13

,

14

,

37

,

38

its molecular regulation has not been fully understood. Our study found that PACSIN2 plays a negative regulatory role against Cobll1 as a potential tumor suppressor in CML. Recent studies found that polymorphism of PACSIN2 is associated with drug‐induced hematotoxicity in patients with ALL undergoing therapy,

24

,

39

showing the potential effects of PACSIN2 on hematopoiesis suppression. Moreover, the activation of the Rac1 pathway leads to TKI resistance at the cellular level and promotes migration and self‐renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, participating in leukemia initiation and maintenance. SH3BP1 has been shown to activate Rac1 to regulate cancer cell behavior.

27

Consistently, our data using K562 cell lines showed that SH3BP1 activated the Rac1 signaling pathway, whereas PACSIN2 inhibited Rac1 activity through its interaction with SH3BP1. The overexpression of Cobll1, which preferentially binds PACSIN2, forces SH3BP1 to be released from its complex with PACSIN2, activating the Rac1 signaling pathway to induce TKI resistance. In patients with CML, Rac1 activity was robustly higher in the BC sample (#1744) expressing Cobll1 and SH3BP1 than in the BC sample (#1919) without the expression of either Cobll1 or SH3BP. In summary, the Rac1 activation by the Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 interactive cascade is closely linked to drug resistance and BC progression in CML.

In the clinical samples, three expression patterns of Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 were primarily observed: Cobll1+/SH3BP1+, Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+, and none. By contrast, no CP patients showed any expression of the three proteins, suggesting that these proteins are related to BC progression. In BC patients, the expression of Cobll1 alone did not induce BC progression, but the co‐expression of SH3BP1, which activates the Rac1 pathway, appears to activate more aggressive BC progression. In addition, PACSIN2‐expressing BC samples without Cobll1 were rarely observed, possibly due to the negative effects of PACSIN2 on SH3BP1. Furthermore, BC patients with Cobll1+/SH3BP1+ or Cobll1+/PACSIN2+/SH3BP1+ showed a higher blast percentage than those without any expression of the three proteins, indicating that Cobll1 and SH3BP1 can aggravate disease progression in CML. Although the expression of both Cobll1 and SH3BP1 is highly correlated to the severity of BC progression with higher blast percentage, the transcript level of BCR‐ABL1 was not significantly correlated with the expression of both proteins. These results demonstrate that Cobll1/SH3BP1‐dependent CML progression is independent of BCR‐ABL1 and that the Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 regulatory cascade can be a novel target for drug resistance and disease progression in CML in a BCR‐ABL1‐independent manner. Taken together, our cellular and organismal studies of Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 and clinical analysis of patient samples showed that the Cobll1/SH3BP1/PACSIN2 axis that modulates Rac1 activity regulates drug resistance and disease progression in CML.

#### PACSIN2 - Article 4: Pacsin2 is required for endocytosis in the zebrafish pronephric tubule
<Date>: 2022-6-23
<PMCID>: 9235069
<Full Text Content>:
INTRODUCTION

The proximal tubule is responsible for the uptake of numerous solutes and water from the renal filtrate. Low molecular weight proteins are retrieved by endocytosis from the apical pole of renal proximal tubule cells, a process mediated by the abundant scavenger receptor megalin (also known as LDL receptor related protein 2, LRP2) and its co-receptor cubulin (

Christensen et al., 2012

;

Eshbach and Weisz, 2017

). These receptors undergo cycles of internalisation and recycling to facilitate the efficient capture of numerous ligands, which dissociate in apical endosomes and are subsequently delivered to the lysosome or undergo transcytosis. Endocytic uptake is mediated by clathrin and associated adaptors and accessory proteins (

Christensen et al., 2012

), most notably Dab2 (

Long et al., 2021

;

Oleinikov et al., 2000

), while recycling is relatively poorly defined in molecular terms. Recycling in proximal tubular cells occurs via recycling tubules that emanate from apical early endosomes and apical vacuoles, which appear to function as a major sorting and recycling compartment in this cell type (

Birn et al., 1993

;

Eshbach and Weisz, 2017

;

Hatae et al., 1997

). In line with a role in recycling, apical vacuoles are associated with Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes in other cell types (

Mattila et al., 2014

). Mutation of megalin is responsible for Donnai–Barrow syndrome, with characteristic tissue-specific defects including the hallmark trait of low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria (

Kantarci et al., 2007

).

The PACSIN (also known as syndapin) family comprises three members in mammals, namely PACSIN1, which is neuronally expressed; PACSIN2, which is ubiquitous; and PACSIN3, which is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart (

Kessels and Qualmann, 2004

;

Quan and Robinson, 2013

). PACSINs contain an amino-terminal banana-shaped F-BAR (Fes-CIP4 homology Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs161/167) domain that binds to membranes to induce or sense membrane curvature (

Frost et al., 2009

), and a carboxy-terminal SH3 domain that interacts with various associated proteins, including trafficking components and actin machinery (

Modregger et al., 2000

;

Qualmann and Kelly, 2000

). PACSIN1 and PACSIN2 also contain NPF motifs that bind to EHD domain proteins (

Braun et al., 2005

;

Xu et al., 2004

), which are involved in membrane sculpting and fission and associated with caveolae formation and endocytic recycling (

Naslavsky and Caplan, 2011

). Pacsins have been implicated in a number of cellular processes that involve membrane remodelling, including clathrin and non-clathrin dependent endocytosis, caveolae formation, endocytic recycling, ciliogenesis, microvilli formation and neuronal morphogenesis (reviewed in

Quan and Robinson, 2013

). Many of these functions have been determined using

in vitro

studies, while the roles of PACSINs have been less well studied

in vivo

. In particular, animal models for the ubiquitously expressed PACSIN2 have only recently been described. Loss of PACSIN2 in mice does not affect viability or fertility and the animals appear generally healthy (

Malinova et al., 2021

;

Postema et al., 2019

;

Semmler et al., 2018

). However, a number of tissue-specific phenotypes have been reported in the PACSIN2 knockouts, namely effects upon microvillar structure in the intestine (

Postema et al., 2019

), reduced blood vessel sprouting in the retina (

Malinova et al., 2021

), and delayed cardiomyocyte development (

Semmler et al., 2018

). The former two phenotypes were attributed to endocytic trafficking defects, either defective endocytic vesicle formation at the apical membrane (

Malinova et al., 2021

), or defective cadherin trafficking (

Malinova et al., 2021

), respectively. Loss of Pacsin2 in zebrafish crispant embryos results in defective ciliogenesis in the olfactory placode, likely caused by defects in membrane tubule formation at the ciliary pocket (

Insinna et al., 2019

).

To better understand the

in vivo

requirements for Pacsin2, we generated a stable

pacsin2

-knockout zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9. We find that stable loss of Pacsin2 in zebrafish does not affect gross morphology, viability or fertility, similar to what is seen in the PACSIN2 knockout mouse. Analysis of the zebrafish pronephros, the larval kidney, revealed a defect in proximal tubular endocytosis upon loss of Pacsin2. This functional defect was accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of megalin, as well a loss of apical endocytic organelles from the proximal tubular cells. Our results indicate a role for Pacsin2 in endocytosis and maintenance of the apical endocytic apparatus in the renal proximal tubule.

RESULTS

Conservation of the Pacsin family in zebrafish

A previous study identified six

pacsin

orthologues in zebrafish (

Edeling et al., 2009

). Using sequence alignment, we too identified the six orthologues, which are shown in

Fig. S1A

.

pacsin1

has been duplicated in zebrafish resulting in two paralogues, named

pacsin1a

and

pacsin1b

. Synteny analysis supports the view these were generated by duplication (

Fig. S1B

).

pacsin2

is present as a single gene in zebrafish, whereas

pacsin3

appears have undergone a duplication event to generate an additional paralogue

ch211-51c14.1

, which in turn also appears to have been duplicated to generate a third related gene

zgc:91999

(

Fig. S1A

).

ch211-51c14.1

and

zgc:91999

share lower homology to mammalian

PACSIN3

than the zebrafish gene annotated as

pacsin3

(

Fig. S1A

). There is good conservation of the zebrafish Pacsins with their mammalian orthologues in the F-BAR and SH3 domains, with the retention of key features such as the wedge-loop in the F-BAR domain and the PxxP motif binding pocket in the SH3 domain (

Fig. S1C,D

). Zebrafish Pacsin1a and Pacsin1b each contain one EHD domain protein-binding NPF motif, as in mammalian PACSIN1, although in Pacsin1a the central proline residue is instead a serine, the significance of which is unclear (

Fig. S1E

). Pacsin2 has three NPF motifs, the same as in mammals, and the three Pacsin3 orthologues all lack NPF motifs, as is the case in the mammalian protein (

Fig. S1E

). Hence, there is good conservation of the zebrafish Pacsins with their mammalian counterparts, particularly in the case of Pacsin2.

Pacsin tissue and developmental expression

We next performed expression analysis of the zebrafish pacsins.

pacsin1a

is predominantly expressed in the nervous system (

Fig. 1

A), which is similar to mammalian

PACSIN1

(

Kessels and Qualmann, 2004

). In contrast,

pacsin1b

is more widely expressed, although the brain is again one of the most highly expressing tissues.

pacsin2

is expressed ubiquitously across all tissues (

Fig. 1

A), as is the case for the mammalian orthologue (

Kessels and Qualmann, 2004

).

pacsin3

is also expressed ubiquitously (

Fig. 1

A), in contrast to the mammalian orthologue, which is predominantly found in heart and skeletal muscle (

Kessels and Qualmann, 2004

). Interestingly, the

pacsin3

paralogue

ch211-51c14.1

shows this enrichment in the heart and skeletal muscle (

Fig. 1

A), similar to the mammalian

PACSIN3

, supporting the view it is a functional gene product in zebrafish. We did not assess the expression profile of

zgc:91999

as it was not fully annotated at the time of the analysis. Analysis of the developmental expression of the zebrafish pacsins revealed that

pacsin1b

,

pacsin2

and

pacsin3

are expressed throughout embryonic development (

Fig. 1

B). All three transcripts are present as maternal pools and their expression is maintained at a relatively constant level through to 72 h post-fertilisation. In contrast,

pacsin1a

and

ch211-51c14.1

are not expressed before 1 day post-fertilisation (dpf), and expression increases beyond this time (

Fig. 1

B). Expression of these two genes therefore coincides with major organogenesis events, consistent with their organ-specific expression pattern in adult animals.

Loss of Pacsin2 in zebrafish does not affect viability or gross morphology

In this study we wanted to assess the functional importance of Pacsin2

in vivo

, and therefore generated a stable knockout zebrafish line using CRISPR/Cas9. Guide RNAs targeting exon 2, the first coding exon of

pacsin2

, were used to generate indels, which sequencing confirmed comprised either a 10 bp or 20 bp deletion, and F1 animals created by outcrossing founders containing these mutations with wild-type fish. Both mutations are expected to result in nonsense mutation and should they be expressed, a severely truncated and non-functional protein (

Fig. 2

A). We failed to obtain breeding pairs containing the same

pacsin2

mutation due to inherent sex bias during breeding in the aquarium at the time the lines were generated, which resulted in a lack of females containing homozygous

pacsin2

mutations. The sex bias was independent of genotype (the same sex ratios were observed with wild type and other lines at that time) and we attribute it to environmental conditions. Compound heterozygotes containing both mutant alleles were therefore generated and used for subsequent experiments. The mutations were present in offspring at an expected Mendelian ratio, indicating that loss of

pacsin2

does not affect embryonic viability (

Fig. 2

B). This is supported by our ability to subsequently generate homozygous

pacsin2

−10bp/−10bp

mutants that are viable (

Fig. S2

). This finding also argues against complementarity between the two mutant alleles. Western blotting of whole-brain lysates of juvenile animals with an antibody raised to zebrafish Pacsin2 confirmed the loss of protein in the compound heterozygote, showing that both mutant alleles fail to generate Pacsin2 protein (

Fig. 2

C). Functional experiments were performed on

pacsin2

null animals created by crossing compound heterozygote males (

pacsin2

−20bp/−10bp

) with females harbouring the 10 bp or 20 bp deletion (

pacsin2

wt/−20bp

or

wt/−10bp

), or by crossing male

pacsin2

+/−10bp

fish with female

pacsin2

+/−20bp

fish. For simplicity,

pacsin2

+/−10bp

or

pacsin2

+/ −20bp

larvae will hereon in be referred to as

pacsin2

+/−

as we did not distinguish between mutant alleles in our experiments. Likewise, as we have shown that

pacsin2

−10bp/−20bp

fish have no Pacsin2 protein, we will refer to these as

pacsin2

−/−

for simplicity.

Error bars=s.d.; scale bar: 1 cm.

Because

pascin2

is expressed throughout embryogenesis, we assessed whether loss of the protein would affect embryonic development and morphogenesis. Time-lapse imaging of

pacsin2

−/−

embryos generated from a heterozygote in-cross indicated no significant developmental delay up to 16 h post-fertilisation (hpf), assessed using gross morphology (

Fig. 2

D). Analysis of

pacsin2

−/−

larvae at 3 and 4 dpf also indicated no developmental delay, and no difference in larval morphology or size (

Fig. 2

E). Although we cannot exclude the possibility of maternal transcript contributing to embryonic survival, morpholino data suggest this is unlikely. Both translation blocking (E2) and splice-blocking (E4) morpholinos targeting

pacsin2

transcripts, when injected into one cell stage embryos, did not affect larval development or viability (

Fig. S3A-D

). Although higher levels of the morpholinos did have some effect on viability and larval morphology, this was likely due to off-target effects at these higher doses as it did not correlate with the level of Pacsin2 knock-down (

Fig. S3A-D

). Analysis of

pacsin2

−/−

mutant zebrafish at juvenile and adult stages indicated normal morphology and size (

Fig. 2

F). Thus, loss of Pacsin2 does not affect zebrafish development, morphogenesis or viability.

Loss of Pacsin2 causes a proximal tubular uptake defect

We next wanted to assess whether loss of Pacsin2 affected endocytosis in the zebrafish renal tubule. Megalin-dependent retrieval of low molecular weight proteins is an extremely active process within the proximal tubule, reliant on a high rate of endocytic uptake and receptor recycling (

Christensen et al., 2012

). Considering the endocytic roles described for mammalian PACSIN2, we hypothesised that it may be required for proximal tubular endocytosis. To test this possibility, we used a previously described assay whereby fluorescent low molecular weight dextran is injected into the bloodstream of zebrafish larvae, and its filtration by the glomerulus and subsequent uptake into the pronephros (larval kidney tubule) assessed using fluorescence microscopy (

Christou-Savina et al., 2015

;

Oltrabella et al., 2015

) (

Fig. 3

A). As shown in

Fig. 3

B, categorical scoring of dextran fluorescence in the pronephros revealed reduced uptake in

pacsin2

-knockout larvae compared to heterozygote controls. This was not due to any defect in tubular morphogenesis as this was normal upon the loss of Pacsin2 (

Fig. S4A

). Nor was it due to effects upon glomerular filtration, indicated by the clearance of dextran from the bloodstream, as this too was normal in the

pacsin2

-knockout larvae (

Fig. S4B

).

pacsin2

morphants also showed reduced dextran uptake (

Fig. 3

C), indicating the phenotype is specific. This was further indicated by rescue of dextran uptake in the knockout animals upon re-expression of wild-type Pacsin2 selectively in the pronephros (

Fig. 3

D), which was achieved using the

enpep

promoter (

Seiler and Pack, 2011

). These results indicate a requirement for Pacsin2 in proximal tubular endocytosis.

Loss of Pacsin2 causes a reduction in abundance of apical endocytic compartments

We next wanted to assess whether loss of Pacsin2 would affect the abundance and morphology of endocytic compartments in the proximal tubule. Active endocytosis in renal proximal tubular cells occurs at the apical membrane, and consequently there is a concentration of endocytic compartments and machinery at the apical pole of the cell. Immunofluorescence microscopy of endogenous Pacsin2 showed enrichment at the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells (

Fig. 4

A), consistent with a previous study showing apical enrichment of Pacsin2 in the mouse renal tubule (

Yao et al., 2013

). Pacsin2 could also be visualised in sub-apical puncta that showed partial co-localisation with megalin, which populates the apical endosomal system, and Rab11, which marks apical vacuolar endosomes in proximal tubule cells (

Mattila et al., 2014

) (

Fig. 4

A;

Fig. S5

). This suggests that Pacsin2 can also reside on sub-apical endosomal compartments. The specificity of the Pacsin2 labelling was confirmed using morphant larvae (

Fig. 4

A). To assess the effects of Pacsin2 loss upon the endosomal network,

pacsin2

morphants were labelled for Rab11 and EEA1, which is a marker of early endosomes, as well as megalin. There was a reduction in the intensity of both endosomal markers at the apical region of proximal tubular cells, suggesting reduced abundance of endocytic compartments (

Fig. 4

B). The megalin signal was also reduced (

Fig. 4

B), possibly due to changes in its trafficking within the endosomal system, which could result in excessive shedding at the apical pole or degradation in lysosomes (

Fatah et al., 2018

;

Gena et al., 2010

). A similar reduction in Rab11 and megalin abundance was also seen in the

pacsin2

-knockout larvae (

Fig. 4

C), supporting the view that loss of Pacsin2 causes loss of apical endosomal compartments and megalin in the proximal tubule.

Fig. 4.

To more directly assess the abundance and morphology of endocytic compartments we used block face scanning electron microscopy, similar to how it was previously performed (

Oltrabella et al., 2021

,

2015

). The endocytic structures are readily identifiable using this approach, with the apical vacuolar endosomes, which serve as a hybrid sorting and recycling compartment, seen as electron lucent structures close to the numerous electron dense recycling tubules found in the sub-apical region (

Fig. 5

A). The overall morphology and polarisation of the proximal tubular cells was normal, with a clear apical brush border present in both control and

pacsin2

-knockout larvae (

Fig. 5

A). Strikingly though, there was a reduction in number and overall area occupied by the apical vacuolar endosomes (AVE) in the

pacsin2

knockout (

Fig. 5

A,B). There also appeared to be fewer recycling tubules, but we were not able to reliably quantify this effect. In contrast to endosomes, the lysosomes of proximal tubule cells appeared unaffected in the

pacsin2

knockout (

Fig. 5

A,B). Together, our results indicate a reduction of apical endosomal compartments upon the loss of Pacsin2.

Fig. 5.

Loss of Pacsin2 results in reduced abundance of the apical endocytic organelles in the proximal tubule.

DISCUSSION

PACSIN2 participates in a number of cellular processes including endocytic traffic, caveolae formation, and ciliogenesis (

Quan and Robinson, 2013

). The extent to which PACSIN2 contributes to these processes

in vivo

, within different tissues, remains poorly defined. In this study, we report that zebrafish Pacsin2 is required for endocytosis

in vivo

, in the renal tubule. Loss of Pacsin2 causes a deficit in endocytic uptake into the apical pole of renal tubular cells, with a reduction in the abundance of endocytic compartments in these cells. Endocytosis in renal tubular cells is a highly active process, important for clearance of low molecular weight proteins from the renal filtrate, and various studies have shown the importance of different proteins in this process (reviewed in

Christensen et al., 2012

). Other studies have shown that PACSIN2 can function in both endocytic uptake and recycling in mammalian cells (reviewed in

Quan and Robinson, 2013

), and both processes may be impaired in our

pacsin2

knockout and morphant larvae. The decrease in abundance of apical endocytic compartments in our experiments suggests endocytic uptake is likely to be affected. A similar albeit more dramatic loss of endocytic organelles is seen when the major endocytic receptor megalin is absent from the proximal tubule (

Anzenberger et al., 2006

;

Kur et al., 2011

). We may therefore expect less endocytic uptake and flux through the pathway due to loss of Pacsin2 to result in reduced abundance of endocytic organelles. A role in caveolar uptake is unlikely considering the caveolin proteins are not expressed in the proximal tubule

in vivo

(

Zhuang et al., 2011

), consistent with a more likely role for Pacsin2 in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Of note, a recent study has shown that mutation of the PACSIN2 binding partner EHD1, which is involved in endocytic recycling (

Naslavsky and Caplan, 2011

), causes a rare tubular disorder characterised by low molecular weight proteinuria due to defective endocytic traffic (

Issler et al., 2022

). Thus, it remains possible that Pacsin2 contributes to both endocytic uptake and recycling within the proximal tubule.

The loss of Pacsin2 in the zebrafish renal tubule did not affect development of this tissue, nor cell polarity or formation and maintenance of the brush border of the proximal tubular epithelial cells. The latter phenotype differs from that seen in the intestine of

PACSIN2

-knockout mice, which have reduced numbers of microvilli and altered microvillar ultrastructure (

Postema et al., 2019

). This may reflect different requirements for the protein in the renal tubule epithelium compared to the intestinal epithelium, or a species-dependent difference. It will be interesting to analyse the renal tubular epithelium of the

PACSIN2

knockout mouse and also look at other tissues in Pacsin2-deficient zebrafish to assess the extent of

pacsin2

null phenotypes in the two model organisms. Although

pacsin2

is broadly expressed at the tissue level and throughout early development, its loss in both zebrafish (this study) and mouse (

Malinova et al., 2021

;

Postema et al., 2019

;

Semmler et al., 2018

) does not lead to gross changes in morphology or viability. This suggests that PACSIN2 may play only an accessory role in the various processes it participates in, at least in an

in vivo

context, or that there is redundancy or functional compensation by other proteins. Candidates here are other F-BAR proteins, including other members of the PACSIN family, that could replace PACSIN2 function when it is absent. Functional redundancy between zebrafish Pacsin1b and Pacsin2 has previously been shown during ciliogenesis, which interestingly differed in the two tissues analysed (otic vesicle and olfactory placode) (

Insinna et al., 2019

). Further analysis of functional redundancy between the PACSINs and/or other F-BAR proteins, as well as possible compensatory mechanisms for loss of PACSIN2, should prove informative in this regard.

A previous study showed changes in PACSIN2 expression within the mouse kidney during development and following injury, where it was more highly expressed than in the adult organ at steady state, consistent with a role in nephrogenesis (

Yao et al., 2013

). This was supported by analysis of kidney tubulogenesis

in vitro

, which was impaired upon PACSIN2 knockdown. Our data indicate that Pacsin2 is dispensable for kidney development

in vivo

in zebrafish, and the viability of

PACSIN2

knockout mice also suggests a minor if any defect in formation of the kidneys in this model. Our data rather support a role for Pacsin2 in the kidney post-development, in maintaining optimal endocytosis within the proximal tubule. Single cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse kidney shows that

PACSIN2

is expressed throughout the adult renal tubule (

Park et al., 2018

), consistent with a function in maintaining renal physiology. It is the most abundant of the three mammalian PACSINs in all segments, including the proximal tubule, as would be expected if it were to function in endocytosis at this location.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibodies

Polyclonal antibodies to zebrafish Pacsin2 were generated in sheep by immunising with a recombinant GST-tagged Pacsin2 construct encoding amino acids 301-388. Immunisation and serum collection were by Orygen Antibodies Ltd. Antibodies were affinity purified from serum by first clearing on GST beads alone followed by affinity purification on the GST-Pacsin2 recombinant protein. Polyclonal antibodies to zebrafish megalin were generated in rabbits against a GST fusion to the cytoplasmic domain, and affinity purified on the recombinant protein. Also used in this study were goat anti-EEA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6415), mouse anti-Rab11 (BD Transduction Labs, 610657), mouse 3G8 anti-proximal tubule (European Xenopus Resource Centre, Portsmouth, UK), and mouse anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-25778). Fluorophore-and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Molecular biology

All constructs were made using standard molecular biology techniques. Zebrafish

pascin2

gene sequences is designated on Ensembl as ENSDARG00000078014. Full-length zebrafish

pacsin2

cDNA was cloned into pT2KXIGDin-enpep vector (Dr Michael Pack, University of Pennsylvania, USA) for expression in zebrafish pronephric tubules. GST-tagged

pacsin2

(encoding amino acids 301-388) was cloned into pFAT2 for bacterial expression and antibody production and purification. cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of zebrafish megalin (amino acids 4464-4673) was cloned into pGEX-4T for antibody production and purification. Primer sequences for all manipulations are available upon request. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid encoding GFP under control of the cardiomyosin light chain 2 promoter (

cmlc2

:GFP) was obtained from Dr Adam Hurlstone (University of Manchester, UK).

Zebrafish strains and husbandry

Zebrafish were raised and maintained at the University of Manchester Biological Services Unit according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The AB strain was used for morpholino studies and the non-pigmented Casper (

White et al., 2008

) strain was used to generate

pacsin2

mutants. AB embryos used in experiments were transferred at 2 hpf to chorion water +0.003% phenylthiourea (PTU) to prevent pigment development. Generation of the

pacsin2

mutant line was performed with CRISPR/Cas9, and this line was maintained as heterozygotes.

RNA isolation and PCR

Total RNA was isolated from zebrafish embryos or adult tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript First Strand (Invitrogen) to produce cDNA. For analysis of amplification products, cDNA was amplified using standard PCR conditions and appropriate primer pairs. For PCR of genomic DNA, genomic DNA was extracted from single or pooled embryos or was isolated from fin clips (1 mm

2

) taken from juvenile fish by extraction into 50 mM NaOH, heating to 95°C, neutralisation using Tris, pH 8, and centrifugation to remove insoluble debris. PCR was performed using standard conditions and appropriate primer pairs.

RNA, DNA and morpholino injections in zebrafish

For CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, guide RNA targeting exon 2 of zebrafish

pacsin2

(GTCCAGCGACAGCTTCTGGG) was co-injected with Cas9 mRNA and protein (40 ng/µl sgRNA, 100 ng/µl Cas9 mRNA, 300 ng/µl EnGen Cas9 protein (NEB); injected at 1 nl volume) into one-cell-stage embryos. Mutagenesis was assessed by performing PCR of the genomic locus followed by restriction digestion using AlwNI, which cuts at the guide target sequence. Mutagenesis confers resistance to digestion. This method was also used for routine genotyping of zebrafish. Discrimination between the two mutant

pacsin2

alleles (

–10 bp

and

−20 bp

) was done by DNA sequencing. For rescue experiments, capped mRNA encoding tol2 transposase was transcribed from the pCS2-FA vector (Dr Michael Pack, University of Pennsylvania, USA) using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) and approximately 1 nl of a mix of 10 ng/µl pT2KXIGDin-

enpep

vector containing

pacsin2

coding sequence, 10 ng/µl

cmcl2

:GFP vector and 20 ng/μl tol2 transposase mRNA was injected into one-cell-stage embryos. Morpholinos were obtained from GeneTools. Control morpholino was described previously (

Ramirez et al., 2012

); 1-3 nl of morpholino targeting zebrafish

pacsin2

(E2, ATGTCTGAAAGAACAACAGCACAGA; E4, CTCGCGCTGCCTGTGTTTACCTCCT) was injected into the yolk sac of one-cell-stage embryos.

Injection and analysis of endocytic tracers

Lysine-fixable Texas Red- or Alexa 488-conjugated 3 kDa or 10 kDa dextran (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was prepared in PBS at 2 µg/µl final concentration. The injected volume was adjusted individually for each tracer used based on the total fluorescence in the larvae circulatory system. Zebrafish larvae at 72 hpf were anesthetised with 0.2 mg/ml MS222 (Sigma-Aldrich), in chorion water, and tracer injected into the common cardinal vein using a glass micropipette PLI-90 Pico-Injector (Harvard Apparatus). Pronephric uptake was assessed at between 1-2.5 h after injection on whole mounts using a fluorescence dissecting stereomicroscope (Leica MZ10F).

Timelapse imaging of zebrafish embryos

Embryos were mounted in 1% low melting point agarose, overlaid with chorion, warmed to 28°C and brightfield images acquired every 10 min on an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) using 10× Plan Fluor objective, the Nikon filter set for GFP and a pE-300 LED (CoolLED) fluorescent light source. NIS Elements AR.46.00.0 software (Nikon) was used to allow multiple embryos to be imaged every 10 min over the course of 24 h, with automatic refocusing. A Retiga R6 (Q-imaging) camera was used to capture single plane images. Images were analysed using NIS Elements Viewer (Nikon) software.

Fluorescence microscopy

Zebrafish larvae were fixed overnight using 4% PFA. For cryosectioning, larvae were mounted in cryosectioning moulds, frozen on dry ice and sectioned using a Leica CM3050 S cryotome. Cryosections were rehydrated with PBS for 5 min at room temperature and blocked overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 5% Donkey serum. Incubation with primary antibodies in blocking solution was for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, followed by secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 4 h at room temperature. Samples were mounted on coverslips in Mowiol. Images were captured with an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope using Lumencor LED excitation, a 100×/1.35 UPlanFl objective and the Penta filter set (Chroma). Images were collected using a R6 (Qimaging) CCD camera. Images were acquired using Metamorph v7.10.09.119 (Molecular Devices). Z-stacks of cryosections were acquired with a Z optical spacing of 0.2 μm and raw images deconvolved using the Huygens Pro software (SVI). For whole mount immunolabelling, fixed larvae were dehydrated in 100% methanol at −20°C overnight, rehydrated at room temperature and washed PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Proteinase K treatment (10 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed for 5 min, and larvae were blocked overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% FCS. Samples were labelled as for cryosections and mounted by overlaying with 1% low melting point agarose. Samples were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS inverted confocal microscope using a 20× HC PL Fluotar (PH2) objective with 0.75× confocal zoom. Three-dimensional optical stacks were acquired using a step size of 1 µm, and images are displayed as maximum intensity projections.

Block face scanning electron microscopy

Serial block face scanning electron microscopy was performed according to (

Oltrabella et al., 2015

). Images were analysed using ImageJ. Endocytic and lysosomal compartments were defined by morphology. Vacuolar endosomes are oval or spherical membrane-enclosed compartments of a diameter greater than 500 nm, with an electron sparse lumen that contains varying degrees of granular material. Lysosomes are electron dense oval or spherical membrane-enclosed compartments of a diameter greater than 500 nm.

Statistical tests

All statistical analyses and graphs were performed with GraphPad Prism version 9. Values are presented as the mean±s.d., and are from a minimum of three independent experiments. The

n

numbers represent sample sizes. The statistical tests used in each case are indicated in the figure legends. All data were first tested for normality. Differences between two independent groups were compared using an unpaired Student's

t

-test. Differences between means of more than two comparison groups were analysed using one-way or two-way ANOVA, with adjustments on multiple comparison tests performed using either the Dunnett, Tukey or Sidak method, depending on the experiment. The Chi-squared test was used to analyse the categorical data obtained in the renal uptake experiments. Survival data were assessed using the non-parametric log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.

Introduction

Sprouting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that originate from pre-existing vasculature, is an essential process for development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. Coordinated endothelial migration and rearrangements drive angiogenesis, and are important for related vascular developmental processes such as anastomosis, lumen formation, and valve morphogenesis

1

–

5

. Angiogenic sprouts are formed by migrating endothelial leader cells (tip cells), which are directly connected to endothelial follower cells (stalk cells), which mediate sprout elongation and vessel branching

6

–

8

. Endothelial cell–cell contacts are formed through VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). AJ remodeling is needed to allow the formation of angiogenic sprouts from the vascular endothelium, whereas stabilization of AJs supports the integrity of newly formed vessels. Hence, a tight regulatory system that is responsible for the making and breaking of endothelial cell–cell contacts is needed for proper sprouting angiogenesis and vascular barrier function

9

–

11

. Although the importance of VE-cadherin-based AJs in angiogenesis has already been well recognized, the molecular events that explain the spatiotemporal turnover of AJs between leader and follower cells are still poorly understood.

VE-cadherin is a transmembrane receptor that connects neighboring cells by forming extracellular homotypic adhesions

11

–

14

. Intracellularly, VE-cadherin binds to the actin cytoskeleton via β-catenin and α-catenin proteins

11

. Besides its function as a structural anchor between endothelial cells and their actomyosin cytoskeleton, VE-cadherin possesses important mechanotransduction properties, which coordinate endothelial collective behavior

15

–

18

. Cytoskeletal-derived forces remodel the organization, protein composition, and function of AJs in cultured endothelial cells

15

,

16

21

and in the endothelium of developing blood vessels

4

,

7

,

22

. In turn, cytoplasmic molecular adaptations within the AJ complex are propagated over multicellular distances via the extracellular VE-cadherin connections

23

,

24

. Such mechanically coupled AJ signaling ensures the finely tuned collective behavior of the endothelium in response to pushing and pulling forces from neighboring cells

24

–

28

.

During collective cell migration, actomyosin contractions occur at the rear of the leader cells, which pulls along the front of the follower cells. These pulling forces at the interface between leader and follower cells produce tension on the cell–cell contacts, leading to the formation of asymmetric AJs

14

,

29

–

31

. Tensile AJs are essential for collective dynamics in cell monolayers

26

,

27

. The polarized trafficking of cadherin-based adhesions is thought to drive this phenomenon

32

. The formation of asymmetric tensile AJs is accompanied by local curvature of the junctional plasma membrane

19

,

33

. We previously showed that recruitment of the curvature-sensing F-BAR protein PACSIN2 (protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons 2) occurs specifically at the rear of asymmetric AJs in the follower cells

19

. Intriguingly, the formation of asymmetric AJs precedes the change in the direction of collectively migrating cells, suggesting that BAR proteins provide follower cells with guidance signals in vitro

14

,

33

. The identification of BAR proteins as molecular players at AJs added curvature sensing of the plasma membrane as contributor to mechanotransduction and junctional remodeling. The previous studies were performed with endothelial cell cultures, and although PACSIN2-positive asymmetric junctions have been observed in human blood vessels as well, to this date, the functional importance of junction-based signaling through BAR proteins in endothelial collective behavior and vascular development remains unknown. In addition, the molecular systems responsible for PACSIN2-driven remodeling of VE-cadherin at asymmetric junctions have not yet been identified.

Here, we reveal that junctional PACSIN2 signaling guides endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Our results show that PACSIN2 mediates endothelial front–rear polarity during collective migration by recruiting the trafficking regulators EHD4 and MICAL-L1 specifically to asymmetric AJs formed between endothelial leader and follower cells. The junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex controls VE-cadherin trafficking and coordinates endothelial migration and angiogenesis. Together, these data show that tensile asymmetric AJs harbor a plasma membrane-bound tubular recycling compartment with marked importance in AJ remodeling and control over endothelial collective migration in the developing vasculature. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the established hypothesis of long-range guidance communication between endothelial cells during angiogenesis.

Results

PACSIN2 controls sprouting angiogenesis in vivo

The F-BAR protein PACSIN2 is recruited to the rear of AJs between endothelial leader–follower cells in vitro to locally protect junctional integrity

19

. In vitro cultured endothelial cells express the PACSIN2 and PACSIN3 isoforms, but no PACSIN1

19

. We first immuno-stained postnatal day 6 (P6) wild-type retinas and confirmed that PACSIN2, but not the related PACSIN3 isoform, is expressed in the endothelium of the developing vasculature of the retina in vivo (Supplementary Fig.

1a

). Next, we generated homozygous

Pacsin2

−/−

knockout mice through homologous recombination and ubiquitous Cre-

loxP

recombination (Supplementary Fig.

1b–d

, see “Methods”). Lack of PACSIN2 protein expression was confirmed in the retina and lung tissue from the

Pacsin2

−/−

mice.

Pacsin2

gene deletion resulted in a slight increase in PACSIN1 and PACSIN3 protein levels in the overall

Pacsin2

−/−

retinal tissue (Supplementary Fig.

1e

).

Pacsin2

−/−

mice are viable, fertile and adult mice appear healthy without major defects or bleedings, which indicates that there is no prominent vascular barrier defect. Some mild delays in cardiomyocyte development were previously reported in

Pacsin2

−/−

mice

34

. To investigate the role of PACSIN2 during angiogenesis, we compared the developing vasculature in control (

Pacsin2

+/+

)

and

Pacsin2

−/−

mice retinas at P6.

Pacsin2

−/−

P6 retinas did not show explicit differences in the number of developing vascular branches and sprouts at the vascular front (Fig.

1a, c

). However, we noticed that the vascular sprouts were shorter, albeit composed by a higher number of endothelial cells (Fig.

1b–d

). This coincided with the formation of abnormal angiogenic sprouts, constituted by endothelial clusters of three or more cells, instead of the clear leader and follower cells that generate sprouts in control vessels (Fig.

1b, d

).

Pacsin2

−/−

retinas showed no differences in the number of endothelial dividing cells (Fig.

1d

). This suggests that the increase in endothelial cell numbers at the vascular sprouts is not due to proliferative changes, but might relate to differences in endothelial cell organization. Furthermore, we observed no changes in the number of endothelial tip cells at the sprouting front in

Pacsin2

−/−

retinas, as defined by endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1) staining (Fig.

1d

and Supplementary Fig.

2a

).

Endothelial cell migration and rearrangements in angiogenic sprouts requires the remodeling of the VE-cadherin-based AJs

4

,

7

,

35

. High-magnification imaging of VE-cadherin stainings revealed that the AJs in angiogenic vessels in the

Pacsin2

−/−

retinas are differently organized (Fig.

1e

). Notably, we observed an increase in cytoplasmic VE-cadherin intensity at the sprouting front in the

Pacsin2

−/−

retinas (Fig.

1e, f

), a feature which has been shown to associate with the remodeling of AJs between endothelial leader and follower cell during angiogenesis

7

. Moreover, the VE-cadherin junctions were completely disorganized in the large endothelial clusters at the sprouting front in the

Pacsin2

−/−

retinas (Supplementary Fig.

2b

). Taken together, these findings show that PACSIN2 is needed for endothelial organization during sprouting angiogenesis and that PACSIN2 modulates VE-cadherin-based endothelial junctions in vivo.

Endothelial PACSIN2 coordinates collective migration and angiogenic sprouting

To understand how PACSIN2 controls endothelial cell movement, we examined in vitro cultured primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in which

PACSIN2

expression was depleted by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs, previously validated in ref.

19

) (Fig.

2a

). Multicellular spheroids composed of shControl or shPACSIN2 HUVECs were placed in 3D collagen matrices

36

to assess VEGF-induced sprouting capacity. Sprout formation and elongation from spheroids was strongly decreased upon depletion of PACSIN2 (Fig.

2b, c

), confirming that PACSIN2 is needed for endothelial-driven angiogenic sprouting. We next performed scratch wound assays of monolayers formed by shControl or shPACSIN2 HUVECs. Depletion of PACSIN2 inhibited cell migration toward the scratch resulting in delayed wound closure (Fig.

2d, e

and Supplementary Movie

1

). Moreover, applying particle image velocity (PIV) analysis

27

,

37

,

38

to the time-lapse recordings revealed that there is a strong decrease in the correlated migration of a given cell and its neighbors upon depletion of PACSIN2 (Fig.

2f

). To decipher whether the depletion of PACSIN2 results in a cell-intrinsic or a collective migration defect, we performed competition scratch assays. Mosaic endothelial monolayers were generated in which half of the HUVECs expressed shControl with an RFP tag and the other half of the HUVECs expressed shPACSIN2 and GFP. Next, scratch assays were performed and the identity of the front row cells during collective migration was determined. The experiments demonstrated that at 12 h after scratch the migrating front is dominated by cells that express PACSIN2, whereas PACSIN2-depleted cells fail to follow during the collective cell migration process (Fig.

2g–i

). These findings indicate that PACSIN2 is needed for coordinated collective cell migration.

Next, we studied whether PACSIN2 might control the front–rear polarization of migrating ECs. Efficient collective migration is tightly dependent on the ability of the cells to polarize toward a directional cue

39

,

40

, and in polarized migrating endothelial cells, the Golgi is located in front of the nucleus

41

,

42

. We assessed Golgi localization in the first two rows of scratch wound migrating shControl and shPACSIN2 HUVECs (Fig.

2j

). The Golgi was considered oriented if localized within a 120° margin relative to the nucleus and the leading edge of the cells (Fig.

2k

). These experiments demonstrate a strong reduction in cell polarization upon PACSIN2 depletion (Fig.

2l

). To determine the importance of PACSIN2 for endothelial polarization during angiogenesis in vivo, we investigated Golgi orientation in ECs at the angiogenic front in control and

Pacsin2

−/−

P6 retinas.

Pacsin2

−/−

ECs were strongly impaired in their capacity to polarize toward the sprouting front (Fig.

2m–o

). Taken together, these results indicate that PACSIN2 is needed for endothelial migration by supporting cell collectivity and polarity during angiogenesis.

PACSIN2 recruitment occurs in parallel with the dissociation of p120-catenin from VE-cadherin

Our previous study has shown that asymmetric AJs are formed between the leader and the follower cells during directed migration, and that PACSIN2 is recruited to the rear side of these contacts in the follower cells (Fig.

3a

and ref.

19

). Since AJ turnover is essential for efficient collective migration

2

,

32

,

43

–

45

, and PACSIN2 locally controls VE-cadherin dynamics at asymmetric AJs

19

, we next investigated how PACSIN2 regulates VE-cadherin turnover. P120-catenin binds to the juxtamembrane domain of the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail where it masks an endocytic motif

46

,

47

. P120-catenin dissociation exposes this motif and induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the VE-cadherin receptor

48

,

49

. To establish whether PACSIN2 and p120-catenin are functionally associated, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) imaging of endogenous p120-catenin, PACSIN2, and VE-cadherin in HUVECs (Fig.

3b

). Linescan analysis across individual asymmetric AJs revealed that p120-catenin is released from the trailing ends of PACSIN2-positive, but not PACSIN2-negative, asymmetric AJs (Fig.

3c, d

). In addition, live imaging of HUVECs expressing PACSIN2-GFP, p120-catenin-mCherry, and live-labeled VE-cadherin showed that PACSIN2 is recruited to the asymmetric AJs after p120-catenin dissociates from VE-cadherin (Supplementary Movie

2

and Supplementary Fig.

3a

). Together these data demonstrate that PACSIN2 is recruited to the asymmetric AJs that are locally primed for internalization due to the release of p120-catenin from the VE-cadherin complex.

PACSIN2 recruitment to asymmetric AJs occurs in parallel with the dissociation of p120-catenin from VE-cadherin.

We next investigated if PACSIN2 is a member of the constitutive endocytic machinery recruited to VE-cadherin after p120-catenin dissociation

48

,

50

. First, endogenous VE-cadherin was depleted from HUVECs by lentiviral shRNAs targeting the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the

CDH5

messenger RNA (Supplementary Fig.

3b

). These VE-cadherin knockdown cells were rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type VE-cadherin-GFP, VE-cadherin[DEE]-GFP, or VE-cadherin[GGG]-GFP; two previously described VE-cadherin variants that contain mutations at the core p120-catenin binding site (Fig.

3e, f

). Both VE-cadherin mutants do not bind to p120-catenin. However, the DEE mutation prevents endocytosis of VE-cadherin and affects endothelial polarization and retinal angiogenesis, while the GGG mutation still allows for VE-cadherin internalization

48

,

51

. IF imaging of the generated endothelial cell lines shows that recruitment of endogenous PACSIN2 to VE-cadherin-, VE-cadherin[DEE]-, and VE-cadherin[GGG]-based asymmetric AJs occurs at comparable levels (Fig.

3e, g

). This indicates that junctional recruitment of PACSIN2 occurs in parallel with the mechanism driving p120-catenin controlled VE-cadherin endocytosis.

PACSIN2, EHD4, and MICAL-L1 bind to each other at the trailing end of asymmetric AJs

To identify the mechanism through which PACSIN2 controls VE-cadherin turnover, we next looked at potential PACSIN2 interactors involved in protein trafficking. PACSIN2 contains Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs that bind to the EH domain of the dynamin-like C-terminal Eps15 homology domain (EHD) proteins

52

(Fig.

4a

). There are four known mammalian EHD proteins, which are linked to different branches of endocytic pathways

53

–

55

. IF imaging in HUVECs revealed that PACSIN2 colocalizes clearly with EHD4, and to a certain extent with EHD1, in a tubular fashion at the asymmetric AJs (Fig.

4b

). No junctional colocalization between PACSIN2 and EHD2 or EHD3 was observed. Quantified Pearson’s colocalization coefficients confirmed the strongest colocalization of PACSIN2 with EHD4 (

R

= 0.62) compared to EHD1 (

R

= 0.38), EHD2 (

R

= 0.20), and EHD3 (

).

IF imaging further showed that EHD4, like PACSIN2

19

, is recruited to the rear of asymmetric AJs in follower cells that are aligned in the direction of collective migration (Supplementary Fig.

4

). To study whether PACSIN2 and EHD4 bind to each other, we next conducted GFP-tag-based immunoprecipitations (IPs) on lysates of HUVECs expressing either PACSIN2-GFP or EHD4-GFP. Endogenous EHD4 was efficiently pulled down in PACSIN2-GFP IPs (Fig.

4d, e

), and vice versa endogenous PACSIN2 was co-immunoprecipitated in EHD4-GFP IPs (Fig.

4f, g

). Together, these results indicate that PACSIN2 and EHD4 interact at the asymmetric AJs during collective migration.

Binding of PACSIN2 to EHD proteins occurs during the biogenesis of the recycling endosome—a tubular recycling compartment

56

,

57

. In addition, EHD4 has been shown to control cargo recycling

58

. The lipid-binding MICAL-like protein 1 (MICAL-L1) links EHD proteins to the endocytic recycling compartment, functions upstream of Rab proteins, and is a marker for endocytic recycling

59

,

60

. IF imaging of HUVECs revealed that MICAL-L1 is recruited to the trailing end of 31% of the asymmetric AJs (Fig.

4h, j

). Next, to investigate whether MICAL-L1 is part of the tubular junctional PACSIN2-EHD4 complex at asymmetric AJs between HUVECs, we assessed colocalization of endogenous MICAL-L1 and ectopically expressed EHD4-GFP (Fig.

4i, k

) or PACSIN2-GFP (Supplementary Fig.

5

). IF-based imaging and Pearson’s coefficient analyses revealed strong junctional colocalization of MICAL-L1 and EHD4-GFP (

R

= 0.72) (Fig.

4i, k

), and MICAL-L1 and PACSIN2-GFP (

R

= 0.82) (Supplementary Fig.

5

). These findings were further corroborated by the notion that endogenous MICAL-L1 was readily pulled down in PACSIN2-GFP IPs from HUVECs (Fig.

4d, l

). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MICAL-L1 interacts with PACSIN2 and EHD4 at the trailing end of asymmetric AJs to form a tubular recycling compartment.

The PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex controls VE-cadherin trafficking at asymmetric AJs

Asymmetric AJs are remodeled in a front–rear polarized fashion, and local PACSIN2 recruitment protects the integrity of VE-cadherin-based junctions

1

,

19

. Concordantly, the depletion of PACSIN2 leads to strongly augmented VE-cadherin internalization levels

19

. To investigate if the interaction of PACSIN2 with the EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex controls VE-cadherin-based junction turnover, we depleted EHD4 from HUVECs by two different

EHD4

-specific shRNAs. IF imaging revealed a clear loss of EHD4 from the trailing end of asymmetric AJs upon EHD4 depletion (Fig.

5a, b

). Intriguingly, both the recruitment of PACSIN2 and MICAL-L1 to asymmetric AJs were also perturbed upon EHD4 depletion (Fig.

5c–f

), indicating complete disruption of the junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex. Vice versa, depletion of PACSIN2 prevented the recruitment of EHD4 to asymmetric AJs (Supplementary Fig.

6

). These experiments show that both EHD4 and PACSIN2 are needed to assemble the junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex.

EHD4 is needed to form a junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex at asymmetric AJs.

HUVECs transduced with shEHD4 were still able to form VE-cadherin-based junctions and no major cytoskeletal changes were observed (Fig.

5

and Supplementary Fig.

7a

). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis indicate that the depletion of EHD4 does not affect overall cell surface levels of VE-cadherin (Supplementary Fig.

7b

). Next, we determined VE-cadherin intensity and localization in shControl, shPACSIN2, and shEHD4 monolayers by immunostaining the VE-cadherin molecules on the cell surface without permeabilization using an anti-VE-cadherin antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope of VE-cadherin. In agreement with the FACS data and our earlier experiments with shPACSIN2 HUVECs

19

, we observed no clear differences in VE-cadherin localization or intensity in the various knockdown conditions compared to control (Fig.

6a

upper images). This indicates that global VE-cadherin-based junction biogenesis pathways are unaffected. To study if EHD4, like PACSIN2, controls VE-cadherin trafficking, we pulse-labeled VE-cadherin molecules on the surface of shControl, shPACSIN2, and shEHD4 HUVECs and followed their turnover and internalization. These experiments show that in a time course of 2 h, a larger proportion of VE-cadherin is internalized and accumulating in intracellular vesicles upon depletion of PACSIN2 or EHD4 (Fig.

6a, b

).

Live imaging of HUVECs expressing EHD4-GFP and VE-cadherin-mCherry showed that the recruitment of EHD4 relates to rapid movements of the asymmetric AJs (Fig.

6c

and Supplementary Movie

3

). To investigate whether EHD4 controls local turnover of the AJs, VE-cadherin-GFP was expressed in shControl and shEHD4 HUVECs. Subsequent live cell imaging experiments clearly showed that the asymmetric AJs are gradually turning over during their movement through subtle internalization events (Fig.

6d

and Supplementary Movie

4

). Importantly, upon the depletion of EHD4, the asymmetric AJs are not turning over in a smooth fashion, but instead elongate until they break (Fig.

6d

and Supplementary Movie

4

). This junctional defect in shEHD4 HUVECs likely underlies the accumulation of VE-cadherin-positive vesicles in the pulse-chase experiments.

We next investigated if EHD4 controls remodeling of AJs during endothelial collective migration. To study this, we live-labeled VE-cadherin in shControl or shEHD4 HUVEC monolayers and induced a scratch wound to trigger collective migration. Both shEHD4 and shControl HUVECs established asymmetric AJs between the leader and follower cells (Fig.

6e

). Live imaging revealed that the asymmetric AJs in shControl HUVECs were gradually resolved, allowing for the dynamic breaking and making of cell–cell contacts to support the coordination of polarized cell migration (Fig.

6e

and Supplementary Movie

5

). Strikingly, in the shEHD4 HUVECs the majority of asymmetric AJs persisted longer, and the asymmetric AJs elongated, supporting the notion that VE-cadherin is not properly trafficked (Fig.

6e

and Supplementary Movie

5

). This resulted in increased maximal junctional length and prolonged lifetime of the asymmetric AJs between EHD4 knockdown cells (Fig.

6f, g

). Together, these findings clearly show that the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex mediates proper VE-cadherin trafficking at asymmetric junctions.

The PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex is needed for endothelial collective migration and sprouting angiogenesis

Next, we validated the functional importance of the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex for endothelial collective behavior. HUVECs depleted of EHD4 exhibited an approximate twofold delay in wound closure compared to control cells (Fig.

7a, b

and Supplementary Movie

6

), similar to the migration capacity of shPACSIN2 HUVECs (Fig.

2d, e

). The correlation length between neighboring migrating shEHD4 HUVECs is reduced compared to shControl (Fig.

7c

), indicative of a loss of collectively coordinated endothelial cell migration upon EHD4 depletion. In addition, the depletion of EHD4 impaired VEGF-induced sprouting and sprout elongation in 3D collagen matrices (Fig.

7d, e

). Based on the notion that these effects are comparable to the functional defects in shPACSIN2 HUVECs (Fig.

2

), we conclude that assembly of the junctional PACSIN2/EHD4 complex supports asymmetric AJ remodeling for collective endothelial migration.

EHD4 is needed for endothelial directed migration, in vitro angiogenic sprouting and coordination of angiogenesis in vivo.

We next investigated the role of EHD4 in retinal angiogenesis. Immunostaining of P6 wild-type retinas showed that EHD4 is highly expressed in the retinal vasculature and associates with VE-cadherin junctions to some extent (Supplementary Fig.

8a

). To establish the importance of EHD4 in vascular development, we generated homozygous

Ehd4

−/−

knockout mice through homologous recombination and ubiquitous Cre-

loxP

recombination (Supplementary Fig.

8b

, see “Methods”). Depletion of EHD4 was confirmed in the retina and lung tissue of the

Ehd4

−/−

mice, and

Ehd4

gene deletion did not affect the expression of the related EHD1, EHD2, and EHD3 isoforms (Supplementary Fig.

8c

).

Ehd4

−/−

mice are viable, fertile, and develop toward adulthood, including development of retinal vasculature with equal number of vascular branch points, sprouts, and endothelial cell numbers (Fig.

7f, g

). Notably, the deletion of EHD4 resulted in a decrease in the endothelial sprout length and an increase in the number of endothelial cell clusters at the angiogenic front of the developing vasculature in P6 retinas (Fig.

7h, i

). Also, we observed a slight increase (not significant) in cytoplasmic VE-cadherin signal in the angiogenic endothelial cells in

Ehd4

−/−

retinal vasculature compared to controls (Fig.

7 j, k

).

Taken together, these results show that EHD4, like PACSIN2, controls endothelial collective migration and angiogenic sprouting. Altogether, these data support the notion that the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex forms a tubular trafficking compartment at asymmetric AJs that is required for coordinated endothelial cell migration and rearrangements during sprouting angiogenesis.

Discussion

The ability of the endothelium to adapt as collective tissue is crucial for vascular development and maintenance of the vascular barrier in the mature organism. Communication between leading tip cells and following stalk cells orchestrates the development of a proper vascular bed and involves direct anchoring, signaling, and orientation between the endothelial cells

2

,

7

. AJs are essential hubs of cell-to-cell communication during collective tissue behavior. Although the importance of mechanical coupling between the leader and follower cells through cadherin-based adhesions has been well established

11

,

61

–

64

, we have only just begun to appreciate the extent to which junctional-derived signaling events guides collective behavior. Our data reveal that the F-BAR protein PACSIN2 acts as a sensor between leader and follower cells by recruiting the trafficking modulators EHD4 and MICAL-L1 to the rear of asymmetric AJs. We find that formation of the junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex drives proper turnover of VE-cadherin at remodeling AJs (Fig.

8

), and we provide proof for the importance of PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex signaling for endothelial collective migration and sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results put forward asymmetric AJs as important players at the endothelial leader and follower cell interface, in addition to the well-established angiogenic signaling cascades, such as VEGF-VEGFR and Delta-Notch signaling that shape the angiogenic front.

Fig. 8

Schematic representation of how the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex controls trafficking of VE-cadherin at asymmetric junctions.

Asymmetric adherens junctions are formed between leader and follower cells in migrating endothelial collectives. The F-BAR protein PACSIN2 as well as the trafficking and recycling proteins EHD4 and MICAL-L1 are recruited to the rear of asymmetric junctions (

a

). The PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex enables the proper trafficking of VE-cadherin at the junction rear, ensuring gradual turnover of asymmetric junctions in support of collective migration (

b

,

c

). In the absence of PACSIN2 or EHD4, this VE-cadherin trafficking systems fails, leading to asymmetric junction elongation and eventually ruptures (

a′, b′

), resulting in an accumulation of internalized VE-cadherin levels (

c′

).

Collective migration requires polarized remodeling of the AJs

,

70

, their role and importance in endothelial migration and vascular development remained to be established. Our data reveal that PACSIN2 is recruited to asymmetric AJs that are primed for endocytosis by the dissociation of p120-catenin from the VE-cadherin complex. At the trailing rear of asymmetric AJs, PACSIN2 binds to the recycling regulators EHD4 and MICAL-L1. Our results further implicate the importance of this junctional tubular trafficking compartment in balancing the breaking and making of AJs during endothelial collective behavior. Recent experiments using transgenic

CDH5

knock-in mouse models, established that the p120-mediated turnover of VE-cadherin is important for endothelial collective migration and endothelial cell polarization

51

. Our current finding that the PACSIN2-EHD4 complex controls VE-cadherin turnover and drives endothelial collective migration and angiogenesis is in strong agreement with the notion that proper trafficking of VE-cadherin is needed for endothelial polarity and retinal angiogenesis.

EHD proteins bind to the NPF motifs of PACSIN2 and their association has been observed in cilia of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, as well as in the soma and neurites of neuronal cells

57

,

71

. Also, an interaction between PACSIN2, EHD1, and MICAL-L1 was previously shown during the formation of the recycling endosome at the nuclear periphery

56

, where it receives cargo sorted for recycling from the early endosome

55

,

72

. Our results reveal that the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex is locally generated at asymmetric AJs to fit the need of the endothelium to direct AJ turnover in collective migration. We observed that MICAL-L1 is also recruited to a fraction of remodeling AJs that are negative for PACSIN2 (Supplementary Fig

5

). This opens up the possibility that additional NPF-containing BAR proteins and/or EHD isoforms are involved in the turnover of AJs of different tubular sizes and/or shapes.

The PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex may contribute to VE-cadherin trafficking by targeting the junctional membrane. EHD1 is known to actively sculpt membranes, thereby driving membrane scission and promoting endocytic recycling

73

. Likewise, expression of PACSIN2, EHD4, and EHD1 has been shown to contribute to infectious virus spread by controlling membrane fission in host cells

74

,

75

. Alternatively, the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex may tighten the connections between endocytic pathways and cytoskeletal adaptations that provide polarized cues across AJs for collectively migrating cells

26

,

40

,

70

.

Here, we have focussed on the primary signaling events at the front–rear interface between migrating neighboring cells, where pulling from the leader cells leads to force-dependent remodeling of the AJs. Interestingly, similar junction remodeling is observed in response to other mechanical triggers such as shear stress

76

and monolayer stiffness heterogeneity

77

,

78

. We therefore expect that the formation of the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex is not limited to collective cell migration during angiogenesis and wound healing. We surmise that the complex forms as an adaptation to a variety of mechanical stimuli that promote rapid turnover of cell–cell contacts and junctional membrane tension to protect junction stability and vascular integrity. Given the notion that PACSIN2 is an ubiquitously expressed protein, experimental approaches using endothelial-specific conditional knockout models might further reveal the function of the PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex as mechanosensing module and its involvement in vascular homeostasis and pathology.

Methods

Cell culture

We used primary HUVEC (up to passage 5) pooled from different donors (obtained under informed consent) from Lonza (Cat # C2519A). HUVEC were cultured on gelatin-coated cell culture dishes in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2 supplemented with the Growth Medium 2 Supplement Pack (EGM-2) from Promocell. HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Medium Eagle medium with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin (100 units mL

−1

), and streptomycin (100 mg mL

−1

) (ThermoFisher). All cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO

2

.

Mice

We used homologous recombination and the Cre-

loxP

recombination to create mice with a

loxP

-flanked (floxed) expression of the

Pacsin2

gene. The targeting vector contained a single

loxP

site in intron 3 and an FRT-site-flanked neo cassette with an additional

loxP

site in intron 4, to allow conditional removal of exon 4 (Supplementary Fig.

1b

). Two independent transfected ES clones with the correct recombination event were identified by Southern blotting and injected into blastocysts. Mice carrying the

Pacsin2

flox(neo)

allele were then bred to homozygosity and crossed with transgenic Flp-recombinase deleter mice to remove the FRT-site flanked neo cassette (Supplementary Fig.

1b

). The resulting homozygous

Pacsin2

flox

mice appeared normal, indicating that the genetic manipulation had not altered the function of PACSIN2. To generate animals lacking PACSIN2 expression,

Pacsin2

flox

mice were bred to transgenic Cre-deleter mice to produce PACSIN2-deficient animals carrying the

Pacsin2

null

allele. The removal of exon 4 was confirmed by Southern blotting on DNA from the progeny (Supplementary Fig.

1c

). To check for homologous recombination, ScaI-digested genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting using a 1.3-kb XhoI-BamHI DNA fragment of a genomic subclone as external probe (corresponding to nt 165762–166609 of acc.no. AL583889). This probe identifies an 8.8-kb fragment and a 6.4-kb fragment in the wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. We backcrossed these mice onto the C57BL/6 background for six generations. In homozygous PACSIN2-deficient mice, very low levels of

Pacsin2

transcripts could be detected by Northern blotting (Supplementary Fig.

1d

), but tested retina and lung tissues lacked the PACSIN2 protein (Supplementary Fig.

1e

). For Northern blot analysis, RNA was isolated from freshly prepared tissues using guanidinium thiocyanate lysis, and poly(A) + RNA was enriched by using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). After fractionation of the RNA by a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and subsequent capillary transfer onto Hybond XL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), hybridization was performed in a formamide mix and radiolabelled probes were generated by using a labeling kit (TaKaRa). For isoform-specific hybridization

79

, the following eluted DNA fragments of the corresponding

Pacsin

cDNA clones were used as probes: a 0.36-kb SmaI fragment corresponding to nt 704–1067 of

Pacsin1

cDNA (acc.no. X85124), a 0.25-kb SmaI/NheI fragment corresponding to nt 718–984 of

Pacsin2

cDNA (acc.no. XM_030248566), and a 0.52-kb SmaI fragment corresponding to nt 854–1379 of

Pacsin3

cDNA (acc. no. NM_028733), respectively. The filters were stringently washed before autoradiography. Prior ethidium bromide staining of the gel and hybridization with glycerin aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were used to control equal loading and to check RNA integrity.

The

Ehd4

mutant mice were commercially generated by inGenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc. (Stony Brook). Briefly, for the construction of the floxed

Ehd4

targeting vector, a genomic fragment spanning a total of 10.05 kb of

Ehd4

sequence including exon 1 was isolated from a C57BL/6 BAC clone (RP23: 108D15) using a homologous recombination-based technique. The final construct was designed such that the long homology arm extends 6.8 kb from the 5′-end of the single

loxP

site located upstream of exon 1 (Supplementary Fig.

8b

). The short homology arm extends 2.2 kb from the 3′-end of the

loxP

/FRT-site-flanked neo cassette, which was inserted downstream of exon 1. The target region spans ~1.0 kb containing exon 1. The resulting targeting construct was linearized by cutting at the NotI restriction site located within the vector backbone 3′ of the sequence homologous to

Ehd4

. Linearized DNA was electroporated into C57BL6/129SvEv hybrid embryonic stem cells. Homologous recombination events were identified by Southern blot analysis using external and internal probes. Four correctly targeted ES cell clones were isolated and injected into C57/BL6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. To generate EHD4-deficient animals, homozygous

Ehd4

flox

mice were crossed to Cre-deleter mice, yielding ubiquitous disruption of the

Ehd4

gene (Supplementary Fig.

8b

).

All mouse studies were performed after ethical approval for breeding and maintaining mice by local government authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen (permission number no. 81-02.04.2019A215, Germany) in accordance with the German animal protection law and with permission to sacrifice mice for scientific purpose. Animals were housed in the Center for Molecular Medicine animal care facility of the University of Cologne under standard pathogen-free, temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions with a 12-h light/dark schedule and provided with food and water ad libitum. Experimental procedures were performed according to all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research.

IF of Golgi was performed with purified mouse anti-GM130 (clone 35, Cat # 610823, diluted 1/200) antibody obtained from BD Biosciences in HUVECs and with the rabbit polyclonal anti-GOLPH4 (1/100 for IF, Cat # ab28049) from Abcam in mouse retinas. IF of cell nuclei was performed with DAPI (Invitrogen; diluted 1/1000). To perform IF on F-actin, we used PromoFluor-415 Phalloidin (Cat # PK-PF415-7-01, diluted 1/200) from Promokine. For IF with fixed cells, the following secondary antibodies from Invitrogen (diluted 1/200) were used: chicken anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (Cat # A21200), chicken anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (Cat # A21441), chicken anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-594 (Cat # A21201), chicken anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-594 (Cat # A21442), chicken anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-647 (Cat # A21463), chicken anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-647 (Cat # A21443), and chicken anti-goat Alexa Fluor-647 (Cat # A21469). For IF stainings in the retina, the following labels and secondary antibodies from Invitrogen were used at 1/300 dilution: Isolectin GS-IB4 Alexa Fluor-488 (Cat # I21411), Isolectin GS-IB4 Alexa Fluor-568 (Cat # I21412), Isolectin GS-IB4 Alexa Fluor-647 (Cat # I32450), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (Cat # A11008), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-568 (Cat # A11011), goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor-488 (Cat # A11006), and goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor-633 (Cat # A21094). As loading control for Western Blot, we used mouse monoclonal anti-human vinculin (Clone hVIN-1, Cat # V9131, diluted 1/1000) antibody from Sigma-Aldrich. To detect GFP in Western Blot, we used mouse anti-GFP (Clone B-2, Cat # sc-9996, dilution 1/1000) antibody from Santa Cruz. For Western Blot protein detection, we used horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse (A28177) and goat anti-rabbit (A27036) secondary antibodies (diluted 1/1000) from Invitrogen.

DNA plasmids and lentiviral transduction

PACSIN2 and EHD4 knockdowns were performed using pLKO.1 lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting human

PACSIN2

or

EHD4

. The shRNA constructs were obtained from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) library

80

. For PACSIN2 knockdown, we used MISSION TRC1 clones 0000037980 and 0000037983 designated as clone shPACSIN2-E1 and D11 throughout the manuscript. For EHD4 knockdown, we used MISSION TRC1 clones 0000053400 and 0000053401, designated as shEHD4-E10 and shEHD4-E1 throughout the manuscript. As a negative control, we used non-targeting shRNA (SHC002) from Sigma-Aldrich. shVE-cadherin-3′UTR was created by allowing two oligos containing the shRNA sequence 5′-CCGGTGGATAGCAAACTCCAGGTTCCCTCGAGGGAACCTGGAGTTTGCTATCCTTTTTG-3′ to self-ligate. The product was then inserted into a modified version of pLKO.1 EV U6 backbone between the AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites. For ectopic expression of EHD4-GFP, human EHD4 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a peGFP-EHD4 plasmid (gift from Prof. Dr Steve Caplan). The PCR product was then cloned into a pLV-CMV-ires-puro vector using the Sequence- and Ligation-Independent Cloning method

81

and Xbal and Nhel restriction sites. The Aspartate-Glutamate-Glutamate (GACGAGGAG) to Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (GCAGCAGCA) mutations at position 646–648 and Glycine-Glycine-Glycine (GGCGGCGGC) to Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (GCAGCAGCA) mutations at position 649–651 in the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain were achieved by site-directed mutagenesis in the peGFP-VE-cadherin plasmid

15

. Next, these plasmids were digested with PstI and Bpu1102I restriction enzymes. The 816-bp fragment, containing the mutations, was exchanged with the wild-type fragment from lentiviral plasmid pLV-CMV-VE-cadherin-eGFP-ires-puro

15

to generate the lentiviral pLV-CMV-VE-cadherin-[DEE646-648AAA]-eGFP and pLV-CMV-VE-cadherin-[GGG649-651AAA]-eGFP plasmids. The lentiviral expression constructs pLV-PACSIN2-GFP, pLV-VE-cadherin-mCherry, and pLV-p120-catenin-mCherry have been described before

15

,

19

. Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells, which were transiently transfected with third-generation packaging constructs and the lentiviral expression vector of interest using Trans-IT LTI (Mirus). HUVECs at 60% confluency were transduced with the lentiviral particles overnight. HUVECs transduced with shRNAs were analyzed at least 72 h post transduction. For primer sequences, see Supplementary Table

IF staining

For standard IF stainings, HUVECs were cultured on coverslips coated with 5-µg ml

−1

human plasma fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA diluted in PBS supplemented with 1-mM CaCl

2

and 0.5-mM MgCl

2

(PBS++) for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.5% BSA in PBS and incubated in dark for 1 h each. After each incubation, the coverslips were thoroughly washed in 0.5% BSA in PBS. After the last wash, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in Mowiol4-88 (Calbiochem, #475904) and DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich, D27802) solution.

For retinal IF, isolated eyes from postnatal day 6 mice were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 1 h on ice and washed in PBS for at least 10 min. Retinas were dissected from the eyes and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 1 h on ice. Retinas were washed with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Next, retinas were incubated with the specific primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Retinas were washed three times in PBST and 30 min at room temperature with Pblec (1-mM MgCl2, 1-mM CaCl2, 0.1-mM MnCl2, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Retinas were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with Isolectin B4 (IB4, Invitrogen, #I21412, diluted 1:300) and the corresponding secondary antibodies in Pblec. Subsequently, the retinas were washed three times with PBST and flat-mounted on microscope glass slides with Mowiol/DABCO. For IF stainings of the Golgi (anti-GOLPH4) and EC nuclei (anti-ERG) in retinas (both primary antibodies are raised in the same species), an extra step was performed

82

. After incubation with anti-ERG antibody and its corresponding secondary, retinas were blocked for 2 h at RT with the AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragments Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1/100, Cat# 711-006-152) from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Retinas were washed three times in PBST and fixed with 4% PFA at RT for 5 min. Next, retinas were washed with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with anti-GOLPH4 antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Finally, retinas were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody in Pblec as described above.

Flow cytometry

HUVECs transduced with shControl, shPACSIN2, or shEHD4 were washed with PBS and detached with accutase on ice, and washed with FACS buffer (0.1% BSA, 2-mM EDTA in PBS). Cells were incubated with anti-surface VE-cadherin Alexa Fluor-647 conjugated antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed on a CytoFLEX S Flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences).

Fluorescence microscopy

Standard IF stainings were imaged on a NIKON Eclipse TI widefield microscope that was equipped with a lumencor SOLA SE II light source, standard DAPI, CFP, GFP, mCherry, or Cy5 filter cubes, 10x CFI Achromat dry objective (0.25 NA) or 60x Apo TIRF oil objective (1.49 NA), and an Andor Zyla 4.2 plus sCMOS camera (Figs.

Immunolabeling for live imaging and VE-cadherin pulse-chase experiments

For live imaging of VE-cadherin experiments, HUVECs were labeled with an Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated Mouse Anti-Human CD144 non-blocking anti-extracellular antibody (Clone 55-7H1; Cat # 561567) diluted 1/200 in EGM-2 at 37 °C. The HUVECs were labeled 10–15 min prior to imaging and maintained in antibody-containing media throughout the imaging experiment (Fig.

6e

). For VE-cadherin pulse-chase experiments (Fig.

6a

), we pre-labeled the cells with the antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, washed the cells with PBS, and either fixed the HUVECs immediately in 4% PFA in PBS++, or first cultured the cells at 37 °C for 2 h.

Wound-healing assay

HUVECs were cultured on 24-well plates or coverslips coated with 5-µg ml

−1

fibronectin. After reaching confluency, the monolayers were scratched cross-wise with a p200 pipette tip and were washed with EGM-2. For live imaging, the 24-well plates were mounted on an inverted NIKON Eclipse TI microscope equipped with Okolab cage incubator and humidified CO

2

gas chamber maintaining 37 °C and 5% CO

2

. Phase-contrast live imaging of wound closure was performed with 10x CFI Achromat DL dry objective (0.25 NA) and an Andor Zyla 4.2 plus sCMOS camera for 16–18 h with a time interval of 10 or 15 min. For IF imaging, the coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS++ 5 h after wounding and subsequently immuno-stained. For the competition scratch assays, HUVECs transduced with shControl-RFP or shPACSIN2 and GFP were seeded as mosaic monolayers in a 24-well plate coated with 5-µg ml

−1

fibronectin. Scratch wound migration was imaged overnight on an inverted NIKON Eclipse TI microscope with a 20× objective using GFP and mCherry filter cubes (NIKON). The ImageJ plugin for manual tracking was used for single-cell tracking, and the Chemotaxis tool plugin was used to quantify velocity and directionality.

Particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis

Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was performed using PIVlab software implemented in MATLAB

83

. The velocity fields of the time-lapses of wound-healing assays were determined using an interrogation window set to 50 × 50 pixels with 50% overlap, enable clahe window size of 30 pixels, and applied to 10-h recordings with 15-min time interval. The mean velocity correlation length was determined from exponential fitting of correlation curves between neighboring windows using the

v

-component of the velocity using the MATLAB code as in refs.

Sprouting angiogenesis assay

For the angiogenic sprouting assay

36

, HUVECs were resuspended in EGM-2 medium containing 0.1% methylcellulose (4000 cP, Sigma, #M0512). For spheroid formation, 750 cells per 100-µl methylcellulose medium were seeded in wells of a U-bottom 96-wells suspension plate and incubated overnight. Next, glass-bottom 96-well plates were coated with 50 µl/well of 1.7-mg ml

−1

Type I rat tail collagen (IBIDI, #50201) mixed with FCS and EGM-2 and placed at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, spheroids were collected and resuspended in the collagen mixture and plated 50 µl/well on top of the coated glass-bottom 96-well plates and placed at 37 °C. After polymerization of the collagen gel, spheroids were stimulated with 50-ng ml

−1

VEGF to induce sprouting overnight. Pictures were acquired using an EVOS M7000 imaging system and 10× objective. Sprouting number and length was analyzed using ImageJ.

Co-IP assay and Western blot analysis

Co-IP on untransduced HUVECs, HUVECs ectopically expressing GFP, GFP-tagged PACSIN2 or EHD4 was performed with magnetic GFP-Trap agarose beads from Chromotek (Cat # gtma-20). Prior to the procedure, the magnetic beads were washed three times in PBS, two times in lysis buffer, blocked for 1 h with 2% BSA in PBS at 4 °C and washed one time with lysis buffer. Cells were lysed with freshly made ice-cold lysis buffer (20-mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150-mM NaCl, 1,7-mM CaCl

2

, and 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with cOmplete

™

, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). The lysates were homogenized with a Douncer homogenizer and sonicated thoroughly. The crude cell lysates were then incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000

g

and 4 °C for 15 min. A portion of the supernatant was used as whole lysate for Western Blot analysis. The rest of the supernatant was added to the GFP-Trap-coupled beads, incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with lysis buffer and PBS on ice. Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in reduced sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and analyzed by Western Blot. Western Blot analysis was performed according to standard Western Blot technique protocols. All samples were taken up in reduced sample buffer. Images were acquired using ImageQuant LAS4000 mini. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Image analysis and quantification

Images were acquired using Nikon Imaging Software Elements and Leica Application Suite. Images were enhanced for display with an unsharp mask filter or processed in ImageJ/Adobe Photoshop. All image analyses for quantifications were performed in ImageJ. Overview and high-resolution images of retinal IF are maximum intensity projections. Quantifications were performed on the obtained high-resolution confocal images as follows: endothelial branch points and proliferating cells were quantified behind the angiogenic front in image field sizes of 100 × 100 μm. The number of sprouts, length of the sprouts, number of endothelial cells, and clustering of cells were quantified at the angiogenic front. The percentage of proliferating cells per unit area in the sprouting front was based on cytoplasmic (dividing cells) versus nuclear ERG (non-dividing cells) stainings. The total number of sprouts and the number of endothelial cells was determined per 100 μm of the angiogenic front border. The number of sprouting clusters was defined as three or more cells per sprout. The number of ESM1

+

cells at the sprouting front was calculated by dividing the number of ESM1

+

endothelial cells per number of total endothelial cells at the sprouting front. VE-cadherin cytoplasmic intensity at the sprouting front was determined by measuring the mean intensity of multiple fixed areas of interest inside the vessels per image and subtracting the mean of the background signal outside the vessels. Golgi orientation in retinas was measured by relating the position of GOLPH4 signal to the center of the mass of the nucleus (ERG) in relation with the vascular sprouting front and represented in a Rose plot showing the angular distribution of individual Golgi orientation (performed in R). The percentage of endothelial cells in the first three rows (tip and stalks cells) with the Golgi polarized ±60° toward the sprouting front direction was determined. In images from scratch wound assays, the boundaries of the wound were manually marked and the decrease of the wounded surface area was measured over time to quantify wound closure velocity. Golgi orientation was assessed by relating the positioning of the GM130 signal to the center of mass of nucleus (DAPI) in relation to the scratch direction. Linescan analysis was performed using 3-µm long lines that span asymmetric AJs measured the integrated intensity profile of the imaged proteins. These profiles were background corrected with the integrated intensities in 3-µm linescans in the cytoplasm in close proximity to the junction. Quantifications of the percentage of PACSIN2, EHD4, or MICAL-L1 positive junctions were calculated as the ratio between all manually counted asymmetric AJs and asymmetric AJs featuring the presence of tubular PACSIN2, EHD4, or MICAL-L1 signals, respectively. Colocalization of proteins at asymmetric AJs were assessed at regions of interest around the tubular junctional structures and defined by the Pearson’s colocalization coefficient obtained by the ImageJ colocalization plugin JACOP. The number of VE-cadherin-positive vesicles in pulse-chase experiments was quantified as the number of vesicles detected in the cytoplasm using the Find Maxima (prominence = 15000) and Analyze Particle (size = 0.1–1.5; circularity = 0.50–1.00) tools in ImageJ. Asymmetric AJs maximal length and lifetime during wound closure were quantified by manually tracking remodeling AJs in the first two rows of migrating cells from the moment of their formation. The intensity of Western Blot bands was measured by the Gel Analyzer plugin in ImageJ.

Introduction

Bromodomain (BRD) is a protein–protein interaction module that consists of about 110 amino acid residues and recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails and other proteins. The human genome encodes 61 BRDs present in 46 distinct proteins, many of which are chromatin regulators, such as chromatin remodeler and histone modifier, that function in a wide array of biological processes. Despite of their diversity of sequences, all BRDs share a conserved fold comprising left-handed four helix bundles linked by the ZA and BC loops, which forms a central deep and narrow hydrophobic cavity for the docking site of acetyl-lysine moiety. The sequence of the ZA and BC loops are highly variable in length and amino acid composition and this structural feature enables different BRDs to specifically bind distinct acetyl-lysine sites in histones and non-histone proteins

.

Recent studies proved that small compound inhibitors specific for BRDs can be developed as therapeutic agents in treatment of various human diseases, including cancer

5

–

8

. As the first examples, JQ1 and I-BET were developed to target the bromo- and extra-terminal domain (BET) family comprising BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, and their antitumor activities have been well documented along with some promising results of clinical trials for certain cancer types

9

–

11

. Subsequently, a number of additional inhibitors for the BET family proteins have been developed and many of these inhibitors are also currently in clinical trials for diverse cancer types

2

,

12

. The success in evolving potent and highly selective inhibitors for the BET family of BRDs and their entry into clinical trials has stimulated intensive research activities to develop BRD inhibitors targeting non-BET family proteins

7

,

13

,

14

. While most of research efforts have been focused on BET family BRD inhibitors, the cellular activity and potential therapeutic applicability of the non-BET BRD inhibitors remains largely unexplored.

One of the recently developed non-BET BRD inhibitors is NVS-CECR2-1, which targets cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 2 (CECR2). CECR2 contains a single BRD and the gene encoding CECR2 is located in the chromosome 22q11 region that is duplicated in the human disorder cat eye syndrome

15

–

17

. Studies have shown that CECR2 is involved in neurulation and chromatin remodeling as well as DNA damage response

15

,

18

. NVS-CECR2-1 was developed by the structural genomics consortium (SGC) in collaboration with Novartis and shown in vitro to bind CECR2 BRD with high affinity (IC

50

= 47 nM,

K

D

= 80 nM) and selectivity over other 48 BRD targets (

https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes/NVS-1

). Neither the activity of NVS-CECR2-1 against its target within cells nor its therapeutic potential in treatment of human diseases, such as cancer, was reported. Here, we demonstrated that NVS-CECR2-1 inhibits chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD and displaces CECR2 from chromatin within cells. We found that NVS-CECR2-1 has a strong cytotoxic activity on various human cancer cells, killing SW48 colon cancer cells in particular with a submicromolar value of half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC

50

) by increasing apoptosis. Our data showed that the cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 on cancer cells is exerted by targeting CECR2 as well as via CECR2-independent mechanism. We also performed analysis of CECR2 gene expression in colorectal cancer tissues using several online databases and discussed the significance of the results.

Results

NVS-CECR2-1 inhibits chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD within cells

First, we determined whether NVS-CECR2-1 (Fig.

1

a) inhibits chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD. After transfection with the plasmid vector expressing a dimeric form of CECR2 BRD, which binds chromatin with higher affinity than a monomeric form

18

, cells were treated with 10 μM of NVS-CECR2-1 and cell lysates were fractionated into insoluble chromatin-bound and soluble chromatin-unbound fractions. Immunoblot analysis showed that CECR2 BRD roughly equally distributed into the both fractions and this distribution largely shifted to the chromatin-unbound fractions with the CECR2-BRD band in the chromatin-bound fraction barely detected (Fig.

1

b, lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6), indicating that NVS-CECR2-1 inhibited the chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD. In parallel experiments, pre-treatment of tricostatin A (TSA) histone deacetylase inhibitor rendered most of CECR2 BRD bound to chromatin, which was nearly completely abolished by NVS-CECR2-1 treatment (Fig.

1

b, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8), further confirming the inhibitory activity of NVS-CECR2-1 against CECR2 BRD. As control, we performed the similar chromatin fractionation experiments for PFI-3, the BRD inhibitor specific for the BRG1 ATPase of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex

19

. Whereas NVS-CECR2-1 effectively inhibited the chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD at the concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 μM, PFI-3 had no activity against CECR2 BRD even at 100 μM or a higher concentration (Fig.

1

c). Conversely, PFI-3 inhibited the chromatin binding of a dimeric form of BRG1 BRD, which also has higher chromatin affinity than a monomeric form

20

, whereas NVS-CECR2-1 had little effect (Fig.

1

d). These results showed that NVS-CECR2-1 has a potent activity against CECR2 BRD within cells.

Cells were harvested and subjected to chromatin fractionation followed by immunoblotting as indicated. Lamin A/C was used as a marker for the chromatin-bound fraction and GAPDH for the soluble unbound fraction. The monomeric forms of CECR2 BRD were produced by degradation of dimeric forms. A representative of three independent experiments showing similar results was shown. (

). A representative of two independent experiments showing similar results was shown. In all drug treatment experiments, the lanes of (−) or 0 μM have DMSO as vehicle.

NVS-CECR2-1 dissociates endogenous CECR2 from chromatin

Next, we determined whether NVS-CECR2-1 can dissociate endogenous CECR2 proteins from chromatin by chromatin fractionation as described before. The cells were treated with NVS-CECR2-1 at 5, 10 or 15 μM, or with PFI-3 as control at 100 or 200 μM. The results showed that NVS-CECR2-1 dissociated CECR2 from chromatin in a dose-dependent manner without affecting BRG1, and conversely, PFI-3 dissociated BRG1 from chromatin with no effect on CECR2 (Fig.

2

a,b). To confirm these results, we conducted salt gradient chromatin fractionation. Most of the cellular CECR2 proteins were extracted by 0.15- and 0.3-M NaCl, and NVS-CECR2-1 treatment increased the CECR2 extraction at 0.15-M NaCl with its concomitant decrease at 0.3-M NaCl (Fig.

2

c,d and Fig.

S1

a–c), indicating that NVS-CECR2-1 dissociated CECR2 from chromatin. As expected from the fact that CECR2 is a chromatin remodeler and thus a nuclear protein, CECR2 was barely detected in the cytoplasmic fractions in salt gradient chromatin fractionation (Fig.

2

c,d and Fig.

S1

a–c) and stained exclusively within the nucleus in immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.

S2

a,b). Essentially no CECR2 was found in the soluble nuclear fractions (Fig.

S1

a,c), indicating that CECR2 exists bound to chromatin in the nucleus. The CECR2 staining pattern remained unchanged after NVS-CECR2-1 treatment in immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.

S2

b). These results therefore demonstrated the activity of NVS-CECR2-1 to prevent its target protein CECR2 from binding chromatin within cells.

NVS-CECR2-1 exhibits cytotoxic activity on various human cancer cells

Having verified the in vivo activity of NVS-CECR2-1, we investigated the possibility that it kills cancer cells. For this, we selected a set of human cancer cell lines that represent various tissue origins, such as colon (SW48, HT29 and HCT116), lung (H460), uroepithelium (SV-HUC-1), cervix (HeLa) and bone (U2OS). The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NVS-CECR2-1 and the cell viability was determined after three days by MTS assay. Interestingly, the treatment of NVS-CECR2-1 decreased the viability of all cancer cells analyzed in a dose dependent manner (Fig.

3

). NVS-CECR2-1 treatment also showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity on human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells, an immortalized cell line originated from non-cancer tissue (Fig.

3

). Notably, NVS-CECR2-1 exhibited cytotoxic activity on all the cell types tested at the pharmacologically significantly concentrations, seemingly with a few micromolar concentrations killing more than half of the cell population (Fig.

3

). Immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of CECR2 expression varied among the tested cell lines, with some displaying very little (HT29, H460, HeLa and SV-HUC-1) and the others exhibiting different degree of CECR2 expression (SW48, HCT116, U2OS and HEK 293 T) (Fig.

3

, last panel). Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 on cancer cells is not necessarily dependent on CECR2 expression. At this moment, owing to the limited accuracy of the short-term viability assay, it was difficult to predict any correlation between the cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 and CECR2 expression levels of cancer cells.

NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 cells with a submicromolar IC

50

value by increasing apoptosis

Since the short-term viability study indicated that NVS-CECR2-1 was most toxic to SW48 cells among the eight cell lines tested, we pursued further investigations for this cell line. First, we determined the effect of NVS-CECR2-1 on the long-term viability of SW480 cells. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NVS-CECR2-1 up to 4 μM and their clonogenic ability was evaluated after ten days by colony formation assay. NVS-CECR2-1 inhibited the clonogenic ability of SW48 cells in a dose dependent manner and its IC

50

value was estimated to be 0.64 μM (Fig.

4

a,b). Next, we determined the mechanisms by which NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 cells. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NVS-CECR2-1 up to 6 μM and analyzed for apoptosis and necrosis after 72 h by Annexin-V assay. NVS-CECR2-1 treatment increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with more than 80% cells undergoing apoptosis at 6 μM, and had virtually no effect on necrosis (Fig.

4

c,d). Increase of apoptosis by NVS-CECR2-1 was confirmed by PARP1 cleavage (Fig.

4

e). Therefore, NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 cells mostly by inducing apoptosis. For the purpose of comparison, we analyzed the toxicity of doxorubicin on SW48 cells and observed that this well-known potent anticancer drug exhibited the IC

50

value of 0.54 μM (Fig.

4

f,g). These results suggest that, given its IC

50

value compatible to doxorubicin, NVS-CECR2-1 can be a potentially good candidate of anticancer drug for colon cancer treatment.

NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 cells by targeting CECR2

Next, we asked whether NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 cells by targeting CECR2. If NVS-CECR2-1 exerts its cytotoxic activity by inhibiting CECR2, depletion of CECR2 should affect the cells’ sensitivity to NVS-CECR2-1. SW48 cells were depleted for CECR2 by specific siRNA (Fig.

5

a) and treated with increasing NVS-CECR2-1 from 0.5 to 2 µM. The clonogenic ability of the cells were then determined by colony formation assay. NVS-CECR2-1 showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic activity on the cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNA with the IC

50

value of 0.62 μM. Depletion of CECR2 by specific siRNA largely decreased the cell viability, indicating that CECR2 was essential for the survival of SW48 cells. Notably, NVS-CECR2-1 exhibited very little effect on the CECR2-depleted cells compared to the control cells, likely due to the large decrease of their viability (Fig.

5

b,c), indicating that the sensitivity of the cells to NVS-CECR2-1 was reduced by CECR2 depletion. Nonetheless, NVS-CECR2-1 treatment still decreased the viability of the CECR2-depleted cells in a dose-dependent manner and this decreasing effect was slightly but significantly less than that on the control cells, accompanied with a shift of the IC

50

value from 0.62 to 0.81 µM (Fig.

5

b,c). We confirmed these findings by analyzing apoptosis by Annexin-V assay. NVS-CECR2-1 increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as observed before. CECR2 depletion largely increased apoptosis and the rate NVS-CECR2-1 increased apoptosis of the CECR2-depleted cells was lower than that of the control cells (Fig.

5

d–f). Consistently, whereas NVS-CECR2-1 increased PARP1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, CECR2 depletion resulted in a large increase of PARP1 cleavage, which was not further enhanced by NVS-CECR2-1 (Fig.

5

g). These results showed that NVS-CECR2-1 exerts the cytotoxic activity on SW48 cells by targeting CECR2 although it still has this activity to some extent even after CECR2 depletion.

CECR2-independent cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1

The reason that CECR2-depleted cells were still sensitive to NVS-CECR2-1 could be due to incomplete CECR2 knockdown or an off-target activity of NVS-CECR2-1. To address this issue, we determine the effect of NVS-CECR2-1 depletion on HEK 293 T cells, which were shown to be independent of CECR2 for their viability

18

. As expected, CECR2 depletion had no effect on the viability of HEK 293 T cells (Fig.

6

a, b–d). Notably, NVS-CECR2-1 exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic activity on the control and CECR2-depleted cells to a similar degree in both short-term (Fig.

6

b) and long-term viability assays (Fig.

6

c,d), indicating that NVS-CECR2-1 exerted the cytotoxic activity independently of CECR2. To further substantiate these results, we analyzed the HAP1 cells, a near-haploid human cell line derived from the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line KBM-7, in which the gene coding for CECR2 was knocked out by the CRISP/Cas9 system. Absence of CECR2 was confirmed for this cell (Fig.

6

E). The establishment of this cell line itself indicates that CECR2 is dispensable for cell survival and proliferation. Indeed, we observed no difference in cell growth between the CECR2-knockout HAP1 and the parental CECR2-wild type HAP1 cells (data not shown). NVS-CECR2-1 showed a similar degree of cytotoxic activity on the both cell lines in short-term (Fig.

6

f) and long-term viability assays (Fig.

6

g,h). The IC

50

values of NVS-CECR2-1 for 293 T and HAP1 cells were 2.45 and 2.73 µM, respectively, which were approximately four times higher than that for SW48 cells. Taking thus far results together, we concluded that NVS-CECR2-1 exerts cytotoxic activity not only by targeting CECR2 but also via CECR2-independent mechanism, possibly the off-target effects.

Cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 on various human colon cancer cells

The results thus far suggested that cells dependent on CECR2 for their viability tend to be more sensitive to NVS-CECR2-1 than CECR2-independent cells. To determine whether this tendency can be generalized, we analyzed a set of human colon cancer cell lines, including DLD-1, LoVo, HCT116, HT29, SW480 and HCT15 as well as SW48 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that SW48 and HCT116 cells expressed CECR2 at the similar levels as HEK 293 T cells whereas the remaining cell lines exhibited very low levels of CECR2 expression (Fig.

7

a). CECR2 depletion reduced the viability of SW48 and HCT116 cells by approximately 72% and 42%, respectively, and had no effect on the viability of the other five cell lines (Fig.

7

b,c). Then, we determined the IC

50

values of NVS-CECR2-1 against these cancer cells as described before. Notably, HCT116 cells exhibited 1.30 µM of IC

50

for NVS-CECR2-1, which was higher than SW48 cells (0.64 µM), whereas the IC

50

values against the other five CECR2-independent cell lines ranged from 2.1 to 3.3 µM (Fig.

7

d). These results showed a good correlation between the cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 on the cancer cells and the extent to which their survival relies on CECR2.

Analysis of CECR2 gene expression in colorectal cancer tissues

To evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we analyzed the CECR2 gene expression in human colorectal cancer using several online databases. First, the data from TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas showed that CECR2 mRNA expression in colorectal cancer ranked at a moderate to medium level among the 32 different cancer types, comprising 10,967 samples from 10,953 patients (Fig.

S3

). A differential analysis of normal and cancer tissues in the 11 colorectal datasets comprising 2033 samples showed that CECR2 mRNA expression was upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to colorectal normal tissues (Fig.

8

a). Immunohistochemical staining data from the Human Protein Atlas revealed that colorectal cancer belonged to a group in which 100% of examined patients displayed medium or high levels of CECR2 protein expression (Fig.

S4

). However, both colorectal normal and colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues showed medium or high levels of CECR2 staining (Fig.

8

b). A Kaplan–Meier survival curve indicated that the group of colon adenocarcinoma patients with high CECR2 expression showed significantly worse survival than that with low CECR2 expression (

P

= 0.041), but CECR2 was not categorized as a prognostic gene in colon cancer (gene with

P

< 0.001 is defined as prognostic) (Fig.

8

c). There was no significant correlation between patient survival probability and CECR2 expression in rectal adenocarcinoma (Fig.

8

c). Thus, it is not conclusive at the moment whether CECR2 is a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer and NVS-CECR2-1 is clinically applicable in treatment of this cancer type.

Discussion

In the present study, we investigated the recently developed BRD inhibitor NVS-CECR2-1 for its potential cytotoxic activity on human cancer cells. First, we demonstrated that NVS-CECR2-1 inhibits chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD and dissociates CECR2 from chromatin within cells. Then, we found that NVS-CECR2-1 has cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cells with different tissue origins at pharmacologically significant concentrations. In particular, NVS-CECR2-1 kills SW48 colon cancer cells with a submicromolar IC

50

value and this activity is exerted mainly by increasing apoptosis. The cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 against the cancer cells is reduced by CECR2 depletion and is positively correlated with the extent to which the cells rely on CECR2 for their survival, suggesting that NVS-CECR2-1 exerts its activity by targeting CECR2. This is the first study that reports an anticancer cytotoxic activity for NVS-CECR2-1.

NVS-CECR2-1 was originally developed as an inhibitor specific for CECR2 BRD. It has no cross reactivity in a BRD panel of 48 targets, with only weak interactions with BRD4 and BRD7, as demonstrated by a thermal shift assay, (

https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes/NVS-1

). However, our results showed that siRNA knockdown of CECR2 in 293 T cells as previously reported

18

or CRISPR/cas9-derived inactivation of the CECR2 gene in haploid leukemia cells did not affect the cytotoxic activity of NVS-CECR2-1 on these cells. Given the fact that CECR2 is dispensable for survival and proliferation of these two cell types, these results suggest that this activity of NVS-CECR2-1 could be exerted by off-targeting some other proteins, which are essential for cell survival and proliferation. Thus, our results have left the question open whether NVS-CECR2-1 is specific for CECR2 within cells.

CECR2 is predominantly expressed in the neural system and involved in neurulation and inner ear development during mouse embryogenesis

15

,

21

. CECR2 forms a complex with the ISWI family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler SNF2L and functions in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in embryonic and post-natal brain development

15

,

22

. CECR2 also forms a complex with SNF2H, another ISWI family chromatin remodeler, in the testis and contributes to spermatogenesis in adult tissue

23

. The CECR2-SNF2L complex, named CERF, has been shown to remodel chromatin in vitro and displace the ATP hydrolysis activity that is stimulated by nucleosomes

15

. A genome-wide screen for human BRD-containing proteins identified CECR2 to be involved in DNA damage response

18

. However, the exact cellular functions of CECR2 remain largely unknown. Our results show that CECR2 is important for cell viability. Interestingly, the role of CECR2 in cell viability depends on cell types such that it is important for SW48 and HCT116 cells but dispensable for 293 T and KBM-7 cells. In addition, CECR2 expression levels vary even among different cancer cells with same tissue origin- a panel of colon cancer cell lines, and the requirement of CECR2 for cell viability is correlated with its expression levels. Therefore, the role of CECR2 in cell viability appears to depend on both cell type and CECR2 level. The exact role of CECR2 in the cancer cell viability and its effects on the cell sensitivity to NVS-CECR2-1 remain to be clearly defined in future study.

Motivated by the success in developing potent and highly selective inhibitors for the BET family BRDs and their entering into clinical trials in cancer treatment, research activities have been extended to developing non-BET family BRD inhibitors, including NVS-CECR2-1

13

,

14

. CECR2 has been ranked top among the 24 human BRD-containing proteins for the score of druggability

24

and our work showed that NVS-CECR2-1 has < 10 μM of the IC

50

values in cytotoxicity against various human cancer cells. Therefore, it is possible that NVS-CECR2-1 can be developed as a candidate of potential cancer therapeutic agent. In particular, our studies using a panel of human colon cancer cell lines raised the possibility that NVS-CECR2-1 has a potential to be used as a therapeutic agent in colon cancer treatment. In support of this, a differential analysis showed that CECR2 mRNA expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal counterparts. However, immunohistochemical staining of CECR2 scored high or medium levels in both colorectal normal and adenocarcinoma tissues from several patients, and CECR2 was not defined as a prognostic gene in colorectal cancer based on the Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Thus, the answer to the question whether NVS-CECR2-1 has a potential of clinical application for treatment of colon cancer is indecisive for now and reserved for future study. Given our data demonstrating the potent activity of NVS-CECR2-1 to displace CECR2 from chromatin within cells, this BRD inhibitor can also be used as a useful tool for studying the cellular functions of CECR2.

Chromatin fractionation assay

Biochemical fractionation of chromatin binding proteins was performed as previously described

25

,

26

. Cells were suspended in the fraction III buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mM NaF) on ice for 60 min. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 16000 g for 20 min to separate supernatant (soluble, cytoplasmic proteins) from pellet (insoluble, chromatin-bound proteins). We note that the fraction III buffer described above extracts chromatin-unbound or loosely bound proteins, thus separating them from chromatin-bound proteins.

The salt gradient chromatin fractionation was performed essentially in the same way as previously described

27

. Cells were lysed in CEBN buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl

2

, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.2% NP-40, protease inhibitors as described above) on ice for 5 min, and the lysate was centrifuged to separate supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) from pellet. After wash with CEB buffer (CEBN buffer without NP-40), the pellet was suspended in soluble nuclear buffer (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, protease inhibitors as described above), incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged to separate supernatant (soluble nuclear fraction) from pellet. The resulting pellet was then subjected to gradient salt extraction with salt buffers with increasing NaCl concentration (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.05% NP-40, NaCl as indicated, protease inhibitors as described above).

Immunoblot analysis was performed by standard method. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mM NaF) on ice for 30 min. The protein concentrations were quantified by BCA method. After separation on SDS gel, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using normal transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-base, 192 mM Glycine, and 20% methanol). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Sigma).

cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 1-ml binding buffer. 100 µl of the suspension (1 × 10

5

cells) were mixed with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 µl of propodium iodide (PI, Invitrogen). After gentle vortex, cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the dark before being subjected to flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).

INTRODUCTION:

CECR2 is a regulatory subunit of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex CERF (CECR2 containing remodeling factor)

1

. Together with ISWI ATPases, SNF2L (SMARCA1) and SNF2H (SMARCA5), CECR2 regulates nucleosome organization to facilitate DNA accessibility during neurulation, spermatogenesis, and other developmental processes

1

,

2

. These chromatin remodeling complexes also play critical roles in transcription and replication by modulating nucleosome spacing

3

,

4

. Additionally, CECR2 contributes to the DNA damage response (DDR) through its bromodomain, which inhibits γ-H2AX activity

5

.

Inflammation plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of cancer

6

. The nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF- κB) is a crucial mediator of inflammatory responses in carcinogenesis

7

. The most abundant, activated form of NF-κB, is composed of a heterodimer of the p65 (RelA) and p50 (RelB) subunits

8

. Acetylation of lysine at residue 310 in RelA is required for optimal transcriptional activity of the NF-κB complex

9

. A recent study identified that CECR2 interacts with the acetylated K310 in RelA, which enhanced NF-κB signaling and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic factors

10

. Moreover, inhibition of CECR2 bromodomain (CECR2-BRD) binding activity reduced the expression of NF-κB mediated immune response and pro-metastatic genes

10

. CECR2 has also been recently identified as a potential prognostic marker for patients with glioma

11

. Thus, targeting CECR2 and its bromodomain activity represents a promising target for modulating NF-κB signaling and associated inflammation in cancer.

The full-length CECR2 is a multidomain protein that contains an N-terminus DDT domain (DNA-binding homeobox and different transcription factors), an AT-hook, and a bromodomain

4

,

12

. The DDT and the AT-hook domains have been shown to bind DNA

13

,

14

, whereas the bromodomain recognizes acetylated lysine

15

. Although the CECR2-BRD has been studied for its ability to recognize acetylated histones, a comprehensive understanding of how it ‘reads’ acetyllysine is still lacking. Moreover, limited information exists on how recognition of these histone modifications influences the chromatin remodeling activity of CECR2.

Over the past decade, research has demonstrated that bromodomains are excellent drug targets due to their crucial role in gene regulation, chromatin remodeling, and protein-protein interactions

16

. Understanding CECR2-BRDs role in these processes would provide valuable insights for the development of selective inhibitors to modulate its activity. In addition, outlining the molecular ligands of the CECR2 bromodomain as a part of the chromatin remodeler CERF would provide insight into its function in chromatin dynamics. To characterize the molecular mechanisms of the selective recognition of acetylated lysine by CECR2 bromodomain, we employed a combination of techniques including peptide array, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our findings reveal a unique binding mode of the CECR2 bromodomain, offering new perspectives on its ability to selectively recognize acetyllysine modifications on both histone and non-histone proteins.

METHODS:

Plasmid construction

A construct encoding amino acids 424–538 of the human CECR2-BRD-containing protein (UniProt code: Q9BXF3–1) was codon optimized for expression in

Escherichia coli

, and cloned into a pGEX-6P-1 plasmid containing an N-terminal GST tag and a PreScission Protease cleavage site (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The plasmid was transformed into

E. coli

BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cells (Novagen, MA, USA) for protein expression.

Protein expression and purification

The GST-CECR2-BRD-containing BL21(DE3) pLysS cells were cultivated following established protocols

17

,

18

. Briefly, cells were grown in 2 L of Terrific broth (TB) media, or

15

N ammonium chloride and

13

C-glucose-supplemented minimal media, with ampicillin and chloramphenicol antibiotics added, at 37°C. Once the optical density at 600 nm (O.D. 600) reached 0.6, the temperature was reduced to 20°C. Subsequently, the cells were grown until the O.D. 600 reached a range of 0.8–1.0 and then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The induced cells were further grown overnight at 20°C. Following induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of lysis buffer, which contained 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 alternative, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL of lysozyme and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor (Pierce protease inhibitor tablets, EDTA-free, ThermoFisher). The cells were then lysed using sonication, and the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 20 minutes. The supernatant was mixed with glutathione agarose resin (ThermoFisher) and incubated at 4°C with gentle agitation for 1 hour. Afterward, the suspension was transferred to Econo-Column Chromatography Columns (Bio-Rad) and washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). The GST tag was then cleaved by incubating the washed beads in wash buffer supplemented with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4°C. The eluted CECR2-BRD protein was subsequently concentrated to a total volume of approximately 3 mL. For dCypher assays, the GST-tag was retained by eluting with 50 mM reduced glutathione and free glutathione removed via dialysis (48 hours) into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the protein absorbance at 280 nm. The purity of the CECR2-BRD was confirmed through sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) stained with GelCode Blue Safe protein stain (ThermoFisher).

dCypher Binding Assays

The approach was performed as previously described with minor modifications

18

,

19

. In brief, 5 μL GST-CECR2-BRD was combined with 5 μL histone peptides (100 nM) or PTM-defined nucleosomes (10 nM) and incubated 30 minutes in a 384-well plate. Binding was detected by adding a 10 μL mixture of 2.5 μg/mL AlphaLISA glutathione Acceptor (Revvity AL109M) and 10 μg/mL streptavidin Donor beads (Revvity 6760002). After a 60-minute incubation, Alpha counts were measured on a PerkinElmer 2104 Envision plate reader (680 nm laser excitation, 570 nm emission filter ± 50 nm bandwidth). Reagents for peptide assays were prepared in: 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM TCEP, 0.0004% Poly-L-Lysine. For nucleosomes they were prepared in: 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.01% NP-40, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM DTT. Binding curves were plotted in GraphPad Prism 10 using 4-parameter logistic nonlinear regression curves. Relative EC

. All binding interactions were performed in duplicate, and incubations performed at room temperature under subdued lighting.

Peptide synthesis

All modified and unmodified peptides were obtained from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). All histone H4 peptides (1–24) were synthesized with N-terminal acetylation (Nα-ac) and C-terminal amidation, while all H3 peptides (1–24) contain only a C-terminus amidation. The RelA peptides (305–315) contain no N-term acetylation or C-term amidation. All peptides were purified with HPLC to reach 98% purity and confirmed using Mass Spectrometry analysis. The amino acid sequences of each peptide can be found in

Table 1

and

Table 3

.

Isothermal titration calorimetry

The CECR2-BRD was dialyzed for 48 hours into 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) (ThermoFisher). All ITC experiments were performed at 5°C using a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern Analytical). All ligands were loaded into the syringe at concentrations ranging from 0.6 mM to 2.5 mM, while the CECR2-BRD was present in the sample cell at concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 0.10 mM. The histone ligand was injected into the sample cell in a series of 20 individual, 2 μL injections, with intervals of 150 s and continuous stirring at 750 RPM. Prior to these injections, a 0.4 μL preliminary injection of the peptide ligand was made but excluded from data integration and binding constant calculation. Control runs were performed by injecting histone peptide into the protein buffer under the same conditions, and the resulting heat of dilution was subtracted from the ligand-protein runs to correct for this effect. Data analysis was conducted using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC software. A single set of binding site models was applied to fit the data and determine the stoichiometry (N) and binding constant (

K

D

). Binding experiments were performed in triplicate, while non-binding runs were conducted in duplicate. The mean

value was calculated from the average of the three binding runs, and the standard deviation was determined based on the mean. All

Analytical Ultracentrifugation

To determine the interaction potential between the CECR2-BRD and mono- and di-acylated histone peptide ligands, and their effect on CECR2-BRD oligomerization, we analyzed mixtures between the two molecules by sedimentation velocity (SV) at various molar ratios including:

CECR2-BRD (apo), measured at 233 nm

CECR2-BRD + H3K4acK9acK14acK18ac at a 1:2 molar ratio, measured at 236 nm

CECR2-BRD + H3K4acK9acK14acK18ac at a 1:2 molar ratio, measured at 232 nm

CECR2-BRD + H3K4acK9acK14acK18ac at a 1:0.5 molar ratio, measured at 238 nm

CECR2-BRD + H3K14ac at a 1:0.5 molar ratio, measured at 239 nm

CECR2-BRD + H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac at a 1:0.5 molar ratio, measured at 232 nm

CECR2-BRD + H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac at a 1:1 molar ratio, measured at 235 nm

CECR2-BRD + H4K8ac at a 1:0.5 molar ratio, measured at 239 nm

The CECR2-BRD protein concentration ranged from 5.2–25.1 μM, multiple molar ratios were used in order to ensure the ligand concentrations would be above the K

D

of the protein:ligand complex as determined by ITC (

Table 1

).

All samples were measured in UV-intensity mode, and to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and maintain all signals within the dynamic range of the absorbance detector, the wavelength of data collection was optimized for optical densities between 0.5–0.8 OD determined by UV spectroscopy using a ThermoFisher Genesys 10s benchtop spectrophotometer prior to AUC analysis. All samples were measured in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaPO4, adjusted to pH 7.0, with 1 mM TCEP added to prevent cysteine oxidation. The experiment was performed at 35,000 rpm for 15 hours at 5°C. Intensity data were collected in an Optima AUC at the Canadian Center for Hydrodynamics at the University of Lethbridge. All data were processed with UltraScan

RESULTS:

CECR2 bromodomain broadly recognizes acetylated histone ligands and tolerates other combinatorial PTMs

There is limited understanding of CECR2-BRD interactions with modified chromatin, thus we sought to investigate its binding to modified histone targets using the high-throughput dCypher approach. This method employs a no-wash bead-based assay platform, AlphaScreen, to assess interactions between the CECR2-BRD and PTM-defined histone ligands in 384-well plates

29

. By titrating the CECR2-BRD against selective peptides including, histone H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac residues 1–23 (H4Tetra

ac

) and unmodified H4 (1–23 aa), we observed a robust interaction to H4Tetra

ac

(EC

50

rel

: 7.2 nM) and determined an optimal probing concentration (26 nM;

Supp. Figure S1

). We then examined CECR2-BRD binding to a comprehensive panel of 287 histone peptides representing diverse sets of single and combinatorial PTMs (methylation, acylation, phosphorylation, etc.) across histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (

Supp. Table 1

for all data). Robust and specific binding was observed toward acetylated peptides with indistinguishable interactions for multi-acetylated peptides across H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (

Figure 1

). Binding was also observed with singly acetylated targets, with the strongest interactions occurring for acetylated histone H3 and H4 peptides (

Figures 1D

–

E

). Additionally, we investigated the impact of neighboring PTMs in the form of methylation (

Figure 1F

) and phosphorylation (

Figure 1G

) on acetyllysine recognition. Methyl groups in close proximity had no effect on the recognition of the adjacent acetylation marks, while phosphorylation mostly impacted acetyl interactions on the histone H3 tail.

Previous studies have shown that CECR2-BRD distinguishes butyrylation and other less bulky acyl groups from crotonylation moeities

30

. Building on this, we expanded our analysis to include additional histone peptides and bulkier acyl modifications. Our data indicate that CECR2-BRD exhibits similar preference for acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl modified histones H3 and H4 peptides (

Figure 2

). However, CECR2-BRD histone interactions were dramatically weakened by all crotonyl peptides. Furthermore, bulkier acyl modifications such as beta-hydroxybutyryl, succinyl, pentanoyl, and hexanoyl modifications were incompatible with CECR2-BRD binding (

Figure 2B

). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the CECR2-BRD selects for short-chain acyl modifications.

The CECR2 bromodomain prefers multi-acetylated histone tail ligands

Binding affinity studies offer quantitative information about the interaction between bromodomains and their ligands, enabling a better understanding of the molecular recognition and binding dynamics involved in bromodomain-mediated processes. Following our initial screening, which demonstrated CECR2-BRD’s preference for acetylated H3 and H4 histone peptides (

Figure 1

), we prioritized quantifying its binding affinity to these ligands. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we identified the preferred acetylated H3/H4 ligands of the CECR2 bromodomain (

Table 1

,

Supp. Figure S2

and

S3

). Among the mono-acetylated H3/H4 ligands examined, CECR2-BRD preferentially bound histone H4K8ac, with an affinity of

K

D

= 15.4 ± 1.9 μM. Among multi-acetylated H3/H4 ligands tested, the highest binding affinity was observed for the H4Tetra

ac

ligand (

K

D

= 1.6 ± 0.2 μM). Conversely, H3Tetra

ac

(H3K4acK9acK14acK18ac) bound with a slightly lower binding affinity (

K

D

= 28.0 ± 1.7 μM). To further evaluate the high binding affinity for the tetra-acetylated H4 ligand, we included various combinations of H4 acetylation marks and assessed their impact on CECR2-BRD binding (

Table 1

). Overall, our results indicate that the CECR2-BRD prefers multi-acetylated histones, especially histone H4. Interestingly, the residues surrounding the acetylated lysine on histone H3 peptides may influence binding affinity of the CECR2 bromodomain. The strongest binding affinity for mono-acetylated H3 peptides is observed when the adjacent amino acids are small nonpolar residues, such as glycine and alanine, as seen with H3K14ac. Whereas the binding affinity of the CECR2-BRD is weaker for the H3K4ac and H3K9ac ligands, which have adjacent residues that are larger and polar (

Table 1

).

Specificity Determinants of the CECR2 Bromodomain Activity

Next, we sought to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the recognition of these acetylated histones by the CECR2-BRD. Using NMR spectroscopy, we aimed to characterize the binding pocket of the CECR2-BRD. First, backbone residues of the CECR2-BRD were assigned using conventional three-dimensional (3D) NMR spectroscopy experiments (

Supp. Figure S4

). Next, to delineate the bromodomain-histone interaction site, 2D,

15

N-

1

H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR experiments were recorded in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of the histone ligands (

Figure 3

,

Supp. Figure S5

–

S8

).

Consistent with previous studies of bromodomain-histone interactions, adding mono- or tetra-acetylated H3 and H4 peptides induced chemical shift perturbations (CSP) within a subset of CECR2-BRD residues. We observed significant CSPs in CECR2 residues lining the ZA and BC loops, and some residues within the αB and αC helices. The CECR2-BRD residues most perturbed upon histone ligand addition are the side-chain Hε-Nε of the W457 and backbone amide resonance of F459 from the ‘WPF’ shelf region. Backbone amide resonances of residues V463, D464, E465, and A468 from the ZA loop, along with Y513, conserved N514, and S518 from the BC loop were also significantly perturbed. A brief analysis of the CSPs highlight that CECR2-BRD employs similar or overlapping binding sites for binding the H3 and H4 histone ligands (

Figure 3

top and bottom panels, and

Supp. Figures S5

–

S8

, respectively). Moreover, our titration data suggests that the CECR2-BRD recognizes acetylated histone H3 independently of the number of acetylation modifications. On the contrary multi-acetylated histone H4 displayed more intense CSPs when compared to the mono-acetylated ligand.

Given the high sensitivity of the residue D464 (ZA-loop of the CECR2-BRD) to the histone H3 and H4 interaction, we designed a D464A CECR2-BRD mutant to study the importance of this residue in CECR2-BRD interaction with acetylated H3 and H4 ligands. Since the conserved asparagine in bromodomains is also known to play a crucial role in bromodomain-histone interaction

31

we created another mutant - N514A of the CECR2-BRD for comparative assessment. Together these mutations will shed light on the contributions of CECR2-BRD residues in coordinating histones.

In our ITC experiments, we exclusively utilized mono- and tetra-acetylated histone H3 and H4 ligands, which exhibited the highest affinity for the wild-type CECR2-BRD (

Table 2

,

Supp. Figure S9

and

S10

). Our findings revealed that substituting residue N514 to Ala significantly reduced binding affinity to both mono-acetylated H3K14ac (

K

D

= 560.5 ± 54.4 μM) and H4K8ac (

K

D

= 518.7 ± 84.6 μM) ligands compared to the wild type (

K

D

= 34.2 ± 5.1 μM and

K

D

= 15.4 ± 1.9 μM, respectively).

Conversely, a D464 to Ala mutation led to only a modest decrease in the binding affinity of the H3K14ac ligand (

K

D

= 74.4 ± 3.1 μM), but a significant decrease in the binding affinity of the H4K8ac ligand (

K

D

= 239.0 ± 18.5 μM) compared to the wild type. Within the tetra-acetylated histone ligands, the N514A mutation had a more pronounced effect on the recognition of H4Tetra

ac

ligands (

K

D

= 37.4 ± 5.4 μM) than H3Tetra

ac

(

K

D

= 28.4 ± 3.4 μM) compared to the wild type (

K

D

= 1.5 ± 0.2 μM and 28.0 ± 1.7 μM, respectively). However, D464 to Ala mutation had lesser impact on either H3Tetra

ac

(

K

D

= 63.3 ± 2.3 μM) or H4Tetra

ac (

K

D

= 37.4 ± 5.4 μM) binding compared to the wild type.

The CECR2 bromodomain is a functional monomer in solution

To determine if the CECR2-BRD exhibits self-association and oligomerization whilst interacting with histone peptide ligands, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. We tested stoichiometric mixtures of the CECR2-BRD with histone peptides containing single and multiple acetylation modifications including, H4K8ac, H3K14ac, H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac, and H3K4acK9acK14acK18ac. Sedimentation profiles for all CECR2-BRD and peptide mixtures are shown in

Figure 4

. All peptide mixtures with the CECR2-BRD sediment identically to the CECR2-BRD apo control, indicating that CECR2-BRD remains monomeric in the presence of histone peptide ligands. Shifts in the sedimentation profile were not observed upon addition of ligands to CECR2-BRD, therefore, binding of ligands to CECR2-BRD cannot be confirmed by AUC for any of the peptide or protein ratios examined. If any binding had taken place, the shift in sedimentation coefficient would have been very small, and likely below the resolution of this method in order to be detectable. Instead, we can conclude that CECR2 remains monomeric, because dimerization of the CECR2-BRD, which would be observable, is not detected.

The CECR2 bromodomain interacts with acetylated RelA via a binding mode distinct from the histone recognition site

Acetylation of the transcription factor p65 (RelA), a member of the NF-κB family, modulates inflammatory responses and drives many of the pathophysiological functions of NF-κB

8

,

9

,

32

,

33

. Specifically, acetylation of Lys310 of RelA is required to fully activate the transcriptional functions of NF-κB

9

,

34

. Recently, CECR2 was identified as a critical epigenetic regulator that interacts with acetylated RelA, increasing the expression of NF-κB target pro-inflammatory genes and driving breast cancer metastasis

10

.

We performed ITC with CECR2-BRD with RelA peptide (RelA residues 305–315) in the presence and absence of K310 acetylation and found that the BRD selects for acetylation mark with a binding affinity of

K

D

= 112.3 ± 4.2 μM (

Table 3

,

Supp Figure S11

). Next, to delineate the RelAK310ac binding pocket we performed 2D HSQC NMR titrations with

15

N-labeled CECR2-BRD in the presence of increasing concentrations of the acetylated RelA peptide (

Figure 5A

). Overall, the CSP pattern for RelAK310ac interaction with CECR2-BRD was similar to the H3 or H4 interaction. However, there were some residues within the ZA and BC loop regions of the CECR2-BRD (E465, A468, N470, and Y472, including the conserved N514) that were more significantly perturbed upon RelA binding than either of the H3 or H4 ligands (

Figure 5

,

Supp. Figure S12

). Since the loops are mostly unstructured, more CSPs in these regions could indicate structural changes or alteration in the chemical environment of these residues upon ligand binding. Additionally, the conserved N514 plays a key role in coordinating acetylated RelA since mutation of N514 to Ala resulted in abolishing RelAK310ac binding (

Table 3

,

Supp. Figure S10E

). Of note is residue D464 which experienced the most significant ligand-induced signal broadening upon addition of higher concentrations of RelAK310ac ligand. Due to this, mapping the chemical shift perturbation of this residue was not possible (red asterisk in

Figure 5A

). Similarly, mutation of D464 to Alanine significantly reduced the binding affinity of CECR2-BRD to acetylated RelA peptide (

Table 3

,

Supp. Figure S9E

) further confirming its role in RelA interaction. CSP-guided mapping onto the apo crystal structure of the CECR2-BRD (PDB ID: 3NXB) delineates the binding pocket for the acetylated RelA ligand which is similar to the binding pocket of H3 or H4 ligands (

Figure 5B

and

C

). Overall, a comparison of chemical shift perturbations induced by acetylated RelA with the acetylated histone H3 and H4 ligands indicates that the interaction of the CECR2-BRD with acetylated RelA is similar to the coordination of the acetyllysine on histones. However, acetylated RelA binding involved more residues within the ZA loop as seen in

Figure 5B

and

5C

. The differences in chemical shift perturbations also suggest that the CECR2-BRD may adopt a unique conformation or binding mode when interacting with acetylated RelA compared to the H3 and H4 histone ligands, potentially reflecting specific molecular recognition mechanisms or functional consequences related to its interaction with RelA.

There are currently two known small molecule inhibitors of the CECR2 bromodomain – NVS-CECR2–1 (Structural Genomics Consortium,

https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes/NVS-CECR2-1

) and GNE-886

35

(Genentech, USA). Of the two, NVS-CECR2–1 has the most potential because it was demonstrated to inhibit the CECR2 - RelA interaction

in vitro

10

, and CECR2 bromodomain chromatin binding ability

36

. Despite this, the structural details on how and where the inhibitor binds within the CECR2 bromodomain pocket are still missing. Using 2D

15

N-

1

H HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we defined the binding contacts for the NVS-CECR2–1 inhibitor within the CECR2-BRD (

Figure 6

). However, since NVS-CECR2–1 is only soluble in DMSO, and since DMSO is itself a competitive bromodomain binding molecule

30

,

37

, we first mapped the binding of DMSO to the

15

N-labeled CECR2-BRD (

Figure 6

,

Supp. Figure S13

). As expected, the binding of DMSO resulted in significant (> 1 Δppm) shifts in residues within the ZA loop and BC loop region, including the conserved asparagine (N514). The binding pocket of DMSO is similar to the acetylated ligands – H3, H4, and RelA. Next, we assessed the binding of the inhibitor NVS-CECR2–1 (dissolved in DMSO) to the

15

N-labeled CECR2-BRD (

Figure 6

,

Supp. Figure S13

). Addition of the inhibitor caused CSPs in residues within the expected DMSO binding pocket as mentioned above, however, we also observed CSPs in some residues within αA, αB and αC helices. Overall, our data indicates that DMSO competes with NVS-CECR2–1 for binding to the CECR-BRD, posing challenges in interpreting NVS-CECR2–1 interactions. However, the inhibitor binding pocket aligns with acetylated ligands such as histones H3, H4 and RelA, hinting NVS-CECR2–1 may target a related area. Further structural analyses are essential to fully understand the inhibitor NVS-CECR2–1’s binding mechanism.

The CECR2 bromodomain prefers binding to multi-acetylated H3 and H4 within the context of the nucleosome

To further elucidate the physiological relevance of CECR2-BRD’s interactions with acetylated histones, we evaluated its binding to PTM-defined nucleosomes. CECR2-BRD demonstrated a clear binding preference for H3Tetra

ac

(EC

50

rel

: 6.0 nM) and H4Tetra

ac

(EC

50

rel

: 9.2 nM) nucleosomes (

Figure 7

,

Supp. Figure S14

). Notably, no binding was observed to any singly acetylated target. This indicates a potential critical role for multiple acetylation modifications (i.e. weakened electrostatic interactions between DNA and histones) in facilitating CECR-BRD interactions within the nucleosomal context.

DISCUSSION

This study provides insight on the bromodomain of CECR2, a subunit within ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes including SMARCA5

1

,

2

. The bromodomain mediates the selective recognition of acetylated lysine residues in regulating chromatin accessibility. These findings provide an understanding of bromodomain specificity in the context of its described roles in regulating both transcription and replication

38

.

In this study, using a high-throughput and combinatorial array of post-translationally modified histone ligands we found that the CECR2-BRD has a higher affinity towards shorter chain acyl modifications on histones H3 and H4, such as H3K9ac/pr/bu >> H3K9bhb/su/vl/hxo (

Figure 1

&

2

). These observations correspond well with previous acetylated histone peptide array and pulldown results

15

,

30

. The differential effect of adjacent PTMs on the recognition of acetylation marks is worth noting. Methylation was observed to be well-tolerated (

Figure 1F

), whereas phosphorylation adjacent to acetyllysine residues hindered recognition (

Figure 1G

). Higher tolerance towards methylation may indicate the ability of the CECR2-BRD to differentiate between various histone states depending on the PTMs nearby. In contrast, phosphorylation potentially serves as a regulatory switch for when CECR2 is recruited. For example, asymmetric segregation of distinct pools of old and new H3 are distinguished by phosphorylation at H3T3 in drosophila germline stem cells, and this tight regulation is integral for proper sister chromatids in prophase

39

. In addition, histone H3S10ph is a conserved PTM involved in chromatin compaction, distinctly associated with dividing cells in metaphase in most organisms

40

. Its role in chromatin compaction, is in part, the result of blocking Heterochromatin Protein 1 from associating with chromosomes during mitosis. Similar to H3T3 phosphorylation in drosophila, H3S10ph is involved with distinguishing “old” vs “new” H3, with this mark being associated with preexisting H3 during early stages of mitosis, while this PTM starts to appear on new H3 as mitosis progresses

41

. H3S10ph has been shown to localize to specific R loops, which are structures composed of newly synthesized RNA, as well as with the template DNA strand and non-template single stranded DNA. R loops are canonically involved in regulating gene transcription, and these structures are also linked with genomic instability

42

. In yeast cells, DNA damage can result from R loop formation. However, mutations in histone H3 at serine 10 that prevented histone phosphorylation were protected from accumulating DNA damage

42

. Experiments by Sharma et. al. suggest that H3S10ph inhibits DNA damage repair machinery. They found inhibition of the primary phosphatases that remove phosphates from H3S10 led to impaired repair of damaged DNA and thus, cell death

43

. Our results indicate that phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between the CECR2 bromodomain and acetylated histone H3 ligands. Phosphorylation of histone H3 promotes chromatin compaction and cell cycle progression, and creates a chromatin state that is less accessible by transcription factors and chromatin binding/remodeling proteins such as CECR2

44

. Additionally, reduced binding between the CECR2 bromodomain and phosphorylated histone H3 may be supported by physiological phenomenon beyond the mechanism of cell cycle progression. Lee et al. utilized siRNA knockdown experiments to demonstrate that CECR2 plays a role in the DNA damage response

5

, while Garcia-Pichardo et al. and Sharma et al. found that phosphorylation of histone H3 leads to impaired DNA repair

42

,

43

. Thus, the correlation between H3 phosphorylation and genomic instability due to increased susceptibility to DNA damage could be associated with the impaired binding of the CECR2 bromodomain to H3 in the presence of phosphorylation. The varying impact adjacent methyl and phosphoryl groups have on recognition of acetylation marks suggests a complex mechanism to fine-tune processes that CECR2 regulates, such as gene expression and DNA repair. Furthermore, the identity of residues adjacent to the acetylated lysine also influences bromodomain binding affinity as demonstrated by the preference of CECR2-BRD for H3K14ac, which is surrounded by small non-polar residues. Similarly, oncogenic mutations in histone proteins are known to disrupt bromodomain binding

45

. Similarly, introducing polar amino acids, such as serine and aspartic acid, adjacent to the acetyllysine residue, abolished acetylated histone ligand binding by the ATAD2 and ATAD2B bromodomains

46

.

Notably, acetylation of histone H3 is associated with neural differentiation

47

,

48

. Considering that CECR2 itself plays a critical role in the neurulation process

1

, it is reasonable to assume that the CECR2-BRD would be recruited through multiply acetylated histone H3. This aligns well with both our ITC data (

Table 1

) and the nucleosome assay (

Figure 7

) that showed a high affinity of CECR2-BRD for histone and nucleosome ligands containing multi-acetylated histone H3 and H4. Hyperacetylation of histone H3 and histone H4 is associated with euchromatic regions where genes are actively expressed

49

. For histone H4, we observe that an increase in the number of acetylated lysine residues corresponds to an increase in binding affinity (

Table 1

). We cannot conclude that histone H3 binding has the same trend as only mono- and tetra-acetylated ligands were used in ITC, although the peptide array data show high alpha counts between CECR2 and di-acetylated lysines on histone H3, which is indicative of an interaction. For both histone H3 and H4, the tightest binding was exhibited between CECR2-BRD and the tetra-acetylated ligands, supporting the trend that multiple acetylation modifications on histone tails increases the binding affinity for bromodomain-containing proteins

46

,

50

,

51

. It is worth noting that some acetyllysine marks contribute more to increasing the binding affinity than others

52

. This is also seen in our ITC data for the CECR2-BRD with acetylated histone H4 ligands. For example, the CECR2-BRD has a nearly identical affinity for di-acetylated H4K5acK8ac (

K

D

= 15.5 ± 1.7 μM) and mono-acetylated H4K8ac (

K

D

= 15.4 ± 1.9 μM), while the affinity for mono-acetylated H4K5ac is significantly lower (

K

D

= 63.8 ± 3.8 μM). Acetylation on residue K8 on histone H4 has a larger contribution to an increased binding affinity. This is supported by ITC data tri-acetylated histone H4 ligands where the CECR2-BRD affinity for H4K5acK12acK16ac (

K

D

= 21.1 ± 1.3 μM) is lower than its affinity for H4K8acK12acK16ac (

K

D

= 19.9 ± 1.2 μM). We also found that the CECR2-BRD exhibits a stronger binding affinity for histone H4 ligands compared to histone H3 ligands. These results provide new insights into the role of CECR2-BRD in nucleosome interactions and its function in regulation. According to relevant literature, histone H3 acetylation is directly associated with transcriptional activation through interaction with transcription factors, while histone H4 acetylation is indirectly associated with transcriptional activation by impacting the structure and stability of the nucleosome

53

,

54

. Histone H4 acetylation influences the accessibility to DNA wrapped around the nucleosome, while histone H3 acetylation potentially affects nucleosome-nucleosome interactions

53

,

54

. Our ITC and the nucleosome binding data demonstrate that CECR2-BRD binds tightly to tetra-acetylated histone H3 and H4 ligands and nucleosomes. This strengthens the idea that CECR2 is a ‘key epigenetic regulator’

4

, as it interacts with modifications associated with transcriptional activation.

Interestingly, in contrast to our peptide array results, the CECR-BRD did not bind to any nucleosomes containing singly acetylated histones or tetra-acetylated H2AK5ac9ac13ac15ac histones (

Figure 7

). This indicates the critical role of acetylation in increasing histone tail accessibility, facilitating specific chromatin interactions. These findings highlight the importance of multi-acetylation for the specificity and recognition of histone tail by CECR2-BRD in the context of the nucleosome.

Similar to acetylation, CECR2-BRD exhibited a preference for propionyl and butyryl modifications on H3 and H4 peptides (

Figure 2

), suggesting a broader recognition of short-chain acyl groups. In contrast, crotonylation markedly diminished binding, while bulkier acyl groups such as beta-hydroxybutyryl and hexanoyl completely eliminated interaction with CECR2-BRD. Our results are consistent with the previous findings

30

that confirmed CECR2-BRD recognized butyryl and propionyl modifications on histone H4 but failed to bind crotonyl H4. Our data supports the view that bromodomains can perform nuanced regulatory processes through their selective recognition of multivalent histones.

Our results from AUC experiments indicate that CECR2 BRDs binding of histone ligands occurs in a monomeric fashion, and the majority of protein is monomeric in solution. Our NMR study focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that drive the specificity in recognizing different acetylation marks by the CECR2-BRD. A detailed comparison of the CSPs upon addition of acetylated histone H3 and H4 peptides reveals they are coordinated similarly within the CECR2 BRD binding pocket (

Figure 5

). The CECR2-BRD residues most perturbed upon histone ligand addition are residues located in the ‘WPF’ shelf region, the BC loop, and the ZA loop containing the conserved N514. The perturbation of these residues is consistent with the literature and indicates the CECR2 BRD uses the canonical mode of acetyllysine recognition

55

. It was revealed that CECR2-BRD recognizes acetylated histone H3 independently of the number of acetylation modifications, while more intense CSPs were observed for multi-acetylated histone H4 compared to the mono-acetylated ligand. When D464 was mutated to Ala, a modest decrease in binding was observed, as shown by our ITC data. On the contrary, N514 mutated to Ala significantly reduced binding, indicative of the conserved residue’s importance. Within the tetra-acetylated histone ligands examined by ITC, the N514A mutation had a more pronounced effect on the recognition of tetra-acetylated histone H4 than tetra-acetylated histone H3 compared to wild-type CECR2 (

Figure 5

). Overall, our data suggests that interactions between CECR2-BRD and the mono-acetylated histone ligands is mediated largely by the conserved residue N514, possibly by creating stabilizing contacts with these ligands thereby impacting their binding affinity. However, charged residues within the CECR2-BRD pocket such as D464 may play some role in modulating the histone interaction which may not directly impact their binding affinity.

We also found that the bromodomain of CECR2 interacts with acetylated RelA in a distinct mode differing from interaction with histone ligands. Acetylation of the transcription factor p65 (RelA), a member of the NF-κB family, modulates inflammatory responses and drives many of the pathophysiological functions of NF-κB

8

,

9

,

32

,

33

. Specifically, acetylation of Lys310 of RelA is required to fully activate the transcriptional functions of NF-κB

9

,

34

. Recently, CECR2 was identified as a critical epigenetic regulator that interacts with acetylated RelA, increasing the expression of NF-κB target pro-inflammatory genes and driving breast cancer metastasis

10

. Overall, the CECR2-BRD coordinates the RelAK310ac ligand similarly to the histone H3 or H4 interactions. However, there are some notable differences, particularly with residues within the ZA and BC loop regions of the CECR2-BRD, where these unstructured loop regions display larger structural rearrangements upon RelAK310ac ligand binding (

Figure 5

). Specifically, A468, N470, and Y472 are more perturbed upon CECR2 binding to acetylated RelA, whereas CSPs in these residues are weaker in the presence of acetylated histone H3 and H4 ligands. Conversely, binding of acetylated histone ligands induces stronger CSPs in residues in the canonical bromodomain ligand binding pocket. These differences indicate a distinct binding mode is used by CECR2 to selectivity recognize both histone and non-histone ligands. However, the conserved asparagine (N514) plays a key role in coordinating both acetylated RelA and acetylated histone ligands, since mutation of N514 to Ala resulted in abolishing RelAK310ac binding (

Table 3

). Other bromodomain-containing proteins are known to bind acetylated lysines on non-histone proteins

56

. The sequence motifs found in non-histone ligands are not as conserved as they are in histone ligands, and the CECR2-BRD must adapt to accommodate recognition of acetylated RelA through additional contacts that stabilize the interaction. Additionally, Huang et al. found the bromodomain of Brd4 also binds to acetylated lysine 310 on RelA, which leads to enhanced transcriptional activation of NF-kB

57

. This result suggests overlapping roles between Brd4 and CECR2, however they did not examine the specific binding mechanism, thus it is unclear if Brd4 and CECR2 utilize a conserved binding mode to interact with RelA.

Previous studies have shown that the CECR2 inhibitor, NVS-CECR2–1, can inhibit interactions between CECR2 and RelA

in vitro

as well as inhibit the chromatin binding abilities of the CECR2-BRD

36

. Our NMR data indicate that the CECR2-BRD uses a distinct binding mode to distinguish between acetylated histones and acetylated RelA as the chemical shift perturbation patterns for the histone vs non-histone ligands show significant differences (

Figure 5

). However, the predominant residues necessary for these interactions are localized to the ZA and BC loops. Interestingly, while the downstream effects of NVS-CECR2–1 correspond to blocking interactions between CECR2 and chromatin as well blocking CECR2 with RelA, our data suggests the NVS-CECR2–1 inhibitor binds to residues that are distinct from those involved in canonical bromodomain recognition of acetyllysine on histones and RelA. Our 2D HSQC NMR data shown in

Figure 6

suggests that NVS-CECR2–1 binds to the αA, αB, and αC secondary structures of the CECR2-BRD. Interestingly, Crawford et.al found that the pyridone carbonyl and pyrrole of another CECR2-BRD inhibitor, GNE-886, forms hydrogen bonds with the N514, a highly conserved residue within the BC loop of the CECR2-BRD (PDBID: 3NXB), while the core pyrrolopyridone of the inhibitor forms π-stacking interactions with the gatekeeper Y520

35

. The piperidine participates in hydrophobic interactions with W457 of the WPF motif and Y467 of the αZ helix. There are additional hydrophobic interactions between F459, P458 and Y520 of the WPF shelf with the allyl group of GNE-866 at the 4-carboxamide, while the carbonyl group of the N-methylpiperidine amide interacts with ZA loop at D464 via hydrogen bonding. When we assessed the binding of NVS-CECR2–1 (dissolved in DMSO) to

15

N-labeled CECR2-BRD via 2D HSQC NMR (

Figure 6

) we observed no shifts overlapping with residues involved in coordinating GNE-886. This could be the result of the structural differences between the two inhibitors, that result in different binding modes that are dependent on the specific ligand. Coordination of acetylated histone peptides and acetylated RelA appear to happen through a slightly different subset of amino acids, but the residues in the ZA and BC loops that are involved in binding to tetra-acetylated histone H3 and H4 ligands and acetylated RelA are somewhat conserved in the coordination of GNE-866. These include residues F459, N514, and D464. Potentially the carbonyl and the allyl-methyl groups of the pyridine in GNE-866 serve as the acetyl-lysine (Kac) mimetic

35

, which are not present on NVS-CECR2–1, which could explain the alternate interaction mode located outside the canonical acetyllysine binding pocket.

Our results demonstrate the histone-binding preferences of the CECR2-BRD and identify critical residues within its binding pocket that drive the distinct binding modalities observed between histone and non-histone ligands. These results support a model where the CECR2-BRD plays an important role in facilitating the interaction of CECR2 with chromatin where it functions as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression. However, characterizing the BRD of CECR2 in isolation, rather than the full-length protein, introduces some limitations to the conclusions of our studies. The regulation of gene expression can be extremely nuanced and context-dependent, and while our results inform initial interaction mechanisms between CECR2 and other regulatory proteins, these interactions may differ in the context of the full-length protein. Furthermore, the use of modified histone ligands in our studies, while this is an accepted technique for structural and functional studies, it has additional limitations. These ligands cannot capture the entirety of that interactions (steric, ionic, hydrophobic, etc.) that occur within the context of the nucleosome. Despite these limitations, our results establish a foundation for further in-depth investigations into the role of CECR2 as a regulator of gene expression and inflammation.

The functional implications of non-histone protein acetylation have been explored in various cellular processes

58

. Non-histone protein acetylation regulates p53-mediated apoptosis

59

, NF-κB signaling

7

, and metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells

58

. In breast cancer, dysregulation of NF-κB signaling drives metastasis

60

. CECR2 was recently recognized as a ‘top epigenetic regulator’ that upregulates NF-κB inflammatory and pro-metastatic genes, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting this bromodomain-containing protein in cancer treatment. Understanding the intricate differences in bromodomain recognition of histone versus non-histone acetylation marks is critical for elucidating the role of these epigenetic mechanisms in the initiation and progression of various diseases. These findings provide strong support for further investigation into CECR2-BRD as a therapeutic target and continued exploration of bromodomain roles in disease contexts.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the research presented in this study sheds light on the recognition and specificity determinants of the CECR2-BRD towards acetylation on histone versus non-histone proteins. Our findings demonstrate that the CECR2-BRD exhibits an ability to recognize a broad range of acylated lysine modifications, accommodating diverse combinations of PTMs on histone H3 and H4 tails. Through NMR titration experiments, we found that the CECR2-BRD uses a distinct binding mode to interact with acetylated histones in comparison with an acetylated RelA peptide. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified key residues within the ZA-BC loop that govern the selective recognition of histone versus non-histone substrates. Overall, this study enhances our knowledge of CECR2-BRD function in coordinating specific PTMs, laying the groundwork for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying the bromodomain-mediated epigenetic regulation and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic development.

Introduction

Human neural tube defects (NTDs) are common, severe, and costly birth defects that arise between the third and fourth weeks of embryogenesis due to partial or complete failure of neural tube closure (NTC)

1

. The incidence of NTDs is ~1 in 1000, but in some geographical regions, it is estimated to reach 4–10 in 1000

2

,

3

.

NTDs are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors

1

. Results from recent studies have suggested that the abnormal homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism is related to the occurrence of NTDs

4

. Epidemiological studies reveal that abnormal maternal homocysteine during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of NTDs in offspring

5

,

6

. Hcy is an intermediate of methionine metabolism, and homocysteine thyolactone (HTL), a metabolite of Hcy can directly modify proteins to affect their function. Hcy modification of albumin in human blood has been shown to influence its structure and function, and subsequently lead to disease development

7

. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicate that human serum proteins are modified by Hcy, and the level of modification is regulated by the serum Hcy level

8

. Results from two other studies have demonstrated the presence of histone homocysteinylation in HEK293T

9

and human endothelial cells

10

, however, there have been no published report on histone homocysteinylation in human fetal tissue.

Emerging evidence suggests an important role of histone marks in epigenetic metabolic control

11

,

12

. Because histone-modifying enzymes consume key metabolites, it is conceivable that they interpret the metabolic state of a given cell by changing chromatin modification patterns. Consistent with this, a global reduction of nuclear acetyl-CoA levels decreases histone acetylation, whereas reduced levels of NAD

+

have the opposite effect, inhibiting histone deacetylation

13

,

14

. An array of histone modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation have been shown to be associated with changes in chromatin organization, gene activation, silencing, and several other nuclear functions

15

,

16

. These findings suggest that Hcy could act as a substrate to modify histones and aberrant histone homocysteinylation may be involved in the failure of NTC.

Building on these previous observations, here we describe the identification and confirmation of homocysteinylation as a histone modification (histone KHcy). The level of histone KHcy was substantially increased under a high-Hcy environment in cells. We demonstrated that in neural stem cells, increased KHcy on histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79Hcy) was associated with the down-regulation of genes related to NTC. Our findings show histone KHcy is a previously unidentified histone modification. Our results suggest that high Hcy levels may increase the expression level of histone H3K79Hcy, resulting in a decrease in expression of some NTC-related genes, which lead to NTDs formation.

Results

Identification and verification of histone Hcy modification

As the first step, the presence of histone homocysteinylation sites were analyzed on trypsin-digested core histones from 10 normal controls of human embryonic brain samples using HPLC/MS/MS (see Supplementary Table

1

for a summary of the information on the individual fetus). A mass shift of +174.04600 Da (monoisotopic mass) at lysine residues of the digested histone peptides was detected. Such a mass shift resembled what had been previously published, indicative of possible homocysteinylation

7

. A typical example of a lysine homocysteinylation-modified peptide, (H4K44Hcy), identified by MS, is shown in Fig.

1a

. Within this peptide, a series of b- and y-type homocysteinylation fragment ions were evident which not only provided reliable sequence information, but also indicated an unambiguous +174.04600 Da shift. For the simplicity purpose, we named the +174.04600 Da shift on histone lysine as histone lysine homocysteinylation (KHcy). Altogether, 39 histone KHcy sites were identified in four major histone variants from 10 normal controls (Fig.

1b

and Supplementary Data

1

), suggesting that homocysteinylation is a relatively common histone mark. Analysis on the frequency of each of the 39 KHcy sites across the 10 human embryonic brain samples revealed that while a number of KHcy sites were conserved among different samples, others were present only in one sample (detailed in Supplementary Table

2

). In addition, most all of the identified histone KHcy sites are the sites that have been shown to be subject to other types of modifications

17

, including H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79 whose modification is important for chromatin structure and function

18

.

c

Verification of anti-KHcy antibody. The homocysteinylation levels of BSA (Bovine Serum Album) and KHcy modified BSA were detected with anti-KHcy antibody under the presence of 0, 2, or 5 µg/ml of Hcy modified lysine (KHcy as competitor). CBB Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. These test repeated for 3 times and the quantitation of the western blotting showed on right. In the BSA group, the relative K-Hcy levels were 1 ± 0.05, 1.15 ± 0.10; 1.11 ± 0.78. In the BSA-Hcy group, the relative K-Hcy levels were 10.88 ± 1.02, 5.48 ± 0.34; 1.39 ± 0.21.

brain, mouse brain, and human fetal brain, demonstrated using western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-Hcy and anti-H3 antibodies

To further confirm the presence of KHcy in histones, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against KHcy using homocysteinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA). Figure

1c

shows that the antibody can detect a much stronger KHcy signal to homocysteinylated BSA than that against unmodified BSA. Furthermore, pre-incubation of homocysteinylated lysine with the antibody diminished the signal against homocysteinylated BSA, but had minimal effect on signal against unmodified BSA (Fig.

1c

). In a separate line of experiments, the anti-KHcy antibody was found to specifically recognize only the homocysteinylated ovalbumin (OVA), but not the acetylated or succinylated OVA (Fig.

1d

).

To confirm the presence of KHcy in histones, western blotting analysis was performed using an antibody against lysine homocysteinylation (anti-KHcy). A significant KHcy signal was observed in histone H3 from human embryonic brain tissues (Fig.

1e

). Histone KHcy signal was also detected in samples from other human embryonic tissues including spinal cord, heart, liver, lung, kidney, muscle, and skin, although to a lesser extent (Fig.

1e

). To further determine whether the KHcy is present in a broad range of species, we performed western blotting analysis using KHcy specific antibody on samples from

D. melanogaster

, Zebrafish,

Gallus gallus

,

M. musculus

to

H. sapiens

, and our results showed that KHcy signal could be detected in all samples (Fig.

1f

). These findings suggest that the histone KHcy is an evolutionarily conserved modification among a wide range of species.

The level of histone KHcy is regulated by HTL level in vitro

Homocysteine thiolactone (HTL) is an intermediate metabolite in the metabolic pathway of Hcy, which has been reported to react with the ε-amino group of lysine residue in proteins (Fig.

2a

)

19

. We performed an in vitro experiment to investigate whether histone homocysteinylation is the result of direct HTL modification, using histones purified from prokaryotic expression. Incubation of purified, unmodified histones H3, H4, H2a, and H2b with 5 mM HTL for 2 h led to significant homocysteinylation of all histones as revealed in dot blot analysis using anti-KHcy antibody (Fig.

2b

, top panel). KHcy modification of histone H3 was found to be dose-dependent, i.e., increase in HTL treatment concentration resulted in an elevation in KHcy signal intensity (Fig.

2b

, bottom panel). In addition, significant KHcy modification of histone H3 was evident after HTL treatment for 14 h (Fig.

2b

, middle panel).

( + : positive control, tubulin antibody diluted 1:1000 was used as the positive control; – : negative control, sodium phosphate buffer was used as the negative control); Middle panel: histone H3 was treated with 5 mM HTL for 2, 6, and 14 h, respectively, and histone homocysteinylation was detected using anti-Hcy antibodies. Bottom panel: histone H3 was treated with 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM HTL respectively for 2 h and histone homocysteinylation was detected using anti-Hcy antibodies.

The difference in molecular mass between the adjacent two peaks is in the proximity of 3 Hcy modifications, indicating that multiple, simultaneous KHcy modifications may exist on H3 during HTL treatment.

The green diamond shape depicts homocysteinylation sites in core histones (H3, H4, H2a, and H2b). The number underneath each red lysine residue (K) represents the position of the particular lysine residue within each respective histone. Homocysteinylation sites, present both naturally in normal human brain samples (Fig.

1b

) and after in vitro HTL treatment are marked with a red dot

The levels of homocysteinylation of the aforementioned histone H3 were further evaluated because H3K4me1 or H3K27ac play a key role during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to neuroepithelium

20

, while H3K9me2 is found to be participating in neuronal differentiation, and H3K9 methylation and H3K4 methylation are involved in the nervous system disease

21

–

23

. The results showed that the undigested H3 displayed a major peak of about 15KD, in accordance with the molecular weight of unmodified H3 (Fig.

2c

, top panel). The HTL-treated histone H3 had one additional major peak with molecular mass greater than 15KD, and the difference in molecular mass between the adjacent two peaks is in the proximity of 3 Hcy modifications, indicating that multiple, simultaneous KHcy modifications may exist on histone H3 during HTL treatment.

We were interested in defining possible sites of histone modification under HTL treatment, therefore we performed QE-HF mass spectrometry analysis on HTL-treated (5 mM, 2 h) histones including H2a, H2b, H3, and H4. Figure

2d

shows a typical MS/MS spectrum of H4K59 peptide (GVLK

Hcy

VFLENVIR) identified from an HTL-treated sample. A mass shift of +174.04600 Da (monoisotopic mass) detected by mass spectrum indicated that there was an Hcy modification on the H4K59 peptide (Fig.

2d

). A total of 24 histone KHcy-modified sites were found in all four histones (Fig.

2e

and Supplementary Data

8

), out of 57 lysine residues in all histones. The highest number of modification sites was found in H2b, while the least number of modification sites was present in H3 (Fig.

2e

). It is worth mentioning that the number of homocysteinylation sites seemed to correlate with the intensity of KHcy signal (except for H4) on western blotting (Fig.

2b

top panel and 2e).

Interestingly, 19 histone KHcy sites were also found in normal human fetal brain samples (depicted with red dot in Fig.

2e

). It not only supports the data from HTL treatment, but also suggests that these same homocysteinylation histone sites including H3K79Hcy may be more exposed at the surface of these histones.

The level of histone KHcy is regulated by cellular Hcy

Since we observed that in vitro HTL treatment resulted in histone homocysteinylation (Fig.

2b, c

), we set to evaluate whether cellular levels of HTL and Hcy could influence levels of histone KHcy. Inside cells, Hcy can be converted to HTL under catalysis of the cellular enzyme MetRS

24

. Figure

3a

is a schematic diagram of the relationship between Hcy, HTL, and protein homocysteinylation. In our experiment, mouse neural stem cell line, NE4C (ATCC CRL-2925) was used. Cultured NE4C cells were treated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM Hcy. Western blotting analysis of extracted histones revealed that histone homocysteinylation levels increased with increasing concentration of Hcy (Fig.

3b

). A more profound dose-dependent histone homocysteinylation was also observed with increasing concentrations of HTL during the treatment of NE4C cells (Fig.

3c

), suggesting a more direct effect of HTL dose on histone homocysteinylation. Treatment of HTL and Hcy also resulted in elevation of cellular histone homocysteinylation in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Figure

1A

and Supplementary Figure

1B

). Furthermore, knockdown of MetRS in HEK293T cells led to a reduction of endogenous HTL, leading to a reduced level of histone homocysteinylation (Supplementary Figure

1E

). Our data provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that cellular metabolites of the homocysteine metabolism pathway may affect histone homocysteinylation.

The detected homocysteinylation sites from treated or untreated samples are shown in green or red diamond shape, respectively. The number underneath each red lysine residue (K) represents the position of the particular lysine residue within each respective histone. Homocysteinylation sites detected in both normal fetal brain (Fig.

1b

) and NE4C are marked with red dots under numbering of lysine residues

To further corroborate these observations, label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (PRM: parallel Reaction Monitoring) was used to identify histone sites before and after pretreatment of HTL. 6 histone KHcy sites were detected in samples from untreated cells while as many as 20 of such sites were identified in cells treated with HTL (Fig.

3d

and Supplementary Table

3

). These data clearly support the notion that cellular histone sites could be modified with increased HTL or Hcy level. Interestingly, we found that 18 of 20 histone KHcy sites in NE4C cells match the sites identified in human fetal brain (Fig.

3d

), indicating that NE4C is an appropriate cell model to investigate the role of histone homocysteinylation in human NTDs formation.

Validation of histone H3K79Hcy and its regulation by cellular Hcy

H3K79 methylation plays important roles in embryonic development

25

and abnormal H3K79 dimethylation results in altered expression of a number of NTC genes and may be involved in NTDs

26

. In this study, results from mass spectrometry demonstrated that histone H3K79Hcy was enriched in all of human fetal brain tissue (Fig.

1b

), HTL-treated commercial histone H3 (Fig.

2e

), and cultured NE4C cells (Fig.

3d

). Therefore, it is of significant rationale to investigate whether aberrant histone H3K79Hcy plays a role in the failure of NTC. Figure

To further verify the site of H3K79Hcy, an antibody against H3K79Hcy (anti-H3K79Hcy) was generated in our laboratory. Supplementary Figure

2A, 2B

and 2C show that anti-H3K79Hcy antibody specifically recognizes homocysteinylated H3K79 (detailed in Methods). Initial western blotting studies using anti-H3K79Hcy revealed that H3K79Hcy was highly enriched in HeLa, HEK293, mouse brain and human fetal brain (Fig.

4b

). Further analysis demonstrated that H3K79Hcy was widely expressed in almost all tissues in human fetus including brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, spinal cord, muscle, skin and placenta (Fig.

4c

).

To investigate whether the metabolite levels of intracellular Hcy was the driving force for H3K79Hcy modification, we performed an western blotting analysis with H3K79Hcy antibody on HTL-treated NE4C cells (Fig.

4d

). A markedly increase in H3K79Hcy was observed with an increase dose of cellular HTL. In addition, treatment with HTL in cultured NE4C cells had an effect on histone methylation and acetylation as well (Fig.

4d

).

The level of H3K79Hcy was also quantified using a mass spectrometry label-free (PRM) method and Skyline software. As shown in Fig.

4e, f

, the modified peptides EIAQDFK

Hcy

TDLR and IAQDFK

Hcy

TDLR, which all contain H3K79Hcy modification, were readily detectable in samples from HTL treated NE4C cells but were not detectable in control group. Compared to H3K79Hcy, level of other histone modifications, i.e. methylation on H3K79 (EIAQDFK

me1

TDLR) increased following 0.5 mM HTL treatment (Fig.

4g

). Level of dimethylation on H3K79 (EIAQDFK

me2

TDLR) did not change significantly following HTL treatment (Fig.

4h

).

Taken together, our results provide sufficient evidence supporting histone H3K79Hcy. In addition, our results demonstrate that the level of histone H3K79Hcy is regulated by intracellular Hcy intermetabolites.

Increase of NTDs and H3K79Hcy level in HTL treated chicken

A number of previous have demonstrated that increases in levels of Hcy or HTL do not lead to NTDs in mice

27

–

29

. Therefore, we explored the potential link between high levels of HTL, as well as elevated levels of histone H3K79Hcy, and the failure of NTC in in vivo experiments using chicken model.

Chicken represents an appropriate animal model to analyze dynamics of neurulation, and has advantages over other models, including a short period of embryogenesis and low cost

30

. The expression pattern of NTC genes is similar in chicken and human embryo, derived from a conservation in chromosomal localization of these genes

31

.

After incubation for 28–30 h, single injection of 0.5 µl of 0.5 mM HTL was carried out into the neural groove of chicken embryos, and chicken embryo malformations of all organs were evaluated on Embryonic Day 5 (E5). In the control group, the chicken embryo survival rate was 95.83% (46/48) with a malformation rate was 2.08%, and the only malformation was NTDs. In the group injected with 0.5 µl of 0.5 mM HTL, the chicken embryo survival rate was 67% (37/55) and the malformation rate was 43.63% (24/55). The malformations included NTDs, heart defects, brain atrophy and tail deformity. Among them, 20 chicken embryos showed NTDs. A typical open spina bifida phenotype and a meningeal encephalocele phenotype of embryo 8 (E8) were shown (Fig.

5a, b

), while Fig.

5c

showed a normal control on E8.

Western blotting assay was performed to compare H3K79Hcy levels in samples from the control and the HTL-treated group. Higher levels of histone H3K79Hcy were detected in samples from chickens of HTL-treated group with phenotypes of NTDs (Fig.

5d

). To further explore the possible role of H3K79Hcy during brain development, we compared levels of H3K79Hcy from E1 to E5 between normal group and HTL injection group (Fig.

5e

). The results demonstrated an increase in histone H3K79Hcy expression during brain development in high-HTL-treated chickens and a decrease in histone H3K79Hcy expression during normal chicken development (Fig.

5e

), indicating that abnormal H3K79Hcy expression may lead to the occurrence of NTDs in chicken. Our data suggest that elevated H3K79Hcy modification may underlie the failure of NTC during early development due to functional disturbance of Hcy metabolism.

Genomic localization of histone H3K79Hcy

To further explore the importance of histone H3K79Hcy during neural system development, in vitro ChIP-seq analysis was performed with NE4C cells using anti-H3K79KHcy antibody. H3K4me3, which is highly enriched in promoter regions, was used as a positive control

32

. A total of 8197 peaks from 3255 genes were detected using anti-H3K4me3 antibody, while 7299 peaks from 1277 genes were identified using anti-H3K79Hcy antibody, scanning through the entire mouse genome (Fig.

6a, b

; Supplementary Data

2

,

3

and

4

). MAnorm was employed to compare peak regions enriched by anti-H3K79Hcy and anti-H3K4me3 antibodies, and ChIP-seq common peaks were used as reference to build the rescaling model of normalization

33

. Profound differences were observed in patterns of enriched peaks between ChIP-seq data obtained with the two different antibodies (Supplementary Figure

3A

), suggesting that histone H3K79Hcy may have a function other than H3K4me3. Supplementary Figure

3B

illustrates that using three different antibodies, a number of peaks were identified by ChIP within the region containing the

Smurf2

gene. These data support our notion that both H3K4me3 and H3K79Hcy antibodies bind their respective targets effectively during ChIP-seq assay, although genomic location of the targets and binding efficiency may vary.

ChIP Gene Ontology term analysis showed that, among the genes targeted with H3K79Hcy, there was bias favoring nervous system-related genes. In the top 10 GO groups of genes with enriched peaks, the top 4 are related to the nervous system (Table

1

). The group of genes with the most enriched peak groups were identified as those involved in nervous system development, followed by genes involved in the generation of neurons and neurogenesis. We then used the DAVID method

34

to perform functional annotation clustering for the biological processes of genes with H3K79Hcy peaks and the results are shown in Supplementary Data

5

. And the top 3 enriched functional cluster of genes was found to be associated with neuron differentiation, neuron migration and regulation of nervous system development. The network of 6 interesting functional clusters was generated by FGNet

35

from Bioconductor project (Fig.

6c

). It also shows that most of the H3K79Hcy-regulated genes were associated with neurodevelopment.

The next question that arises in this context is whether H3K79Hcy can regulate the expression level of genes with enriched peak in ChIP-seq assays. We compared the H3K79Hcy enrichment level to the gene body obtained from ChIP-seq (Supplementary Data

6

) and the expression level of these H3K79Hcy binding genes define in RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Data

7

). All genes were divided into five groups according to their enrichment level at each 20% percentile. and the expression level of each gene within each group was analyzed. Our results showed that gene expression was gradually elevated with the increase of H3K79Hcy enrichment level (Fig.

6d

), while H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter was associated with gene activation, which is consistent with findings from previous studies (Fig.

6e

)

36

.

Enrichment and expression levels of NTC related genes

We were interested in investigating if and how the level of histone H3K79Hcy might affect H3K79Hcy binding to NTC related genes and subsequently, their expression. Among over 300 genes and 14 epigenetic regulator genes connected with NTDs in the mouse, only

Cecr2

,

Smarca4

, and

Dnmt3b

are founded in H3K79Hcy peak genes. Therefore, we focused our first set of experiments on

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

. We analyzed H3K79Hcy enrichment on

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

in NE4C cells under normal or HTL treatment conditions.

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

are NTC related genes, the loss of function of which has been shown to result in NTDs.

ChIP-seq analysis showed that the H3K79Hcy enrichment levels on the three NTC genes were all higher in untreated NE4C than in HTL-treated NE4C (Fig.

7a

, top panel). The most profound effect of HTL-treatment on H3K79Hcy enrichment level was observed in

Cecr2

genes. Further experimentation using ChIP-qPCR confirmed that in HTL-treated NE4C cells, H3K79Hcy enrichment of

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

were decreased (Fig.

7b

).

Next, we evaluated the level of H3K79Hcy enrichment in different regions of

Smarca4

. As shown in Fig.

7c

, in untreated NE4C cells, H3K79Hcy enrichment was found to be significantly higher within the

Smarca4

gene body than the upstream and downstream regions of this gene. Upon HTL treatment profound reduction of H3K79Hcy enrichment was evident in the gene body of

Smarca4

than the other two regions, implying that the increase in H3K79Hcy level may hinder the binding of H3K79Hcy to its targets.

Lastly, the potential effect of HTL-treatment and diminished H3K79Hcy binding to these three genes on their respective gene expression was investigated. Not surprisingly, results from RNA-seq analysis indicated a diminished expression of these three genes in HTL-treated NE4C (Fig.

7a

, below panel). Further RT-PCR confirmed that the expression level of these three genes decreased in HTL-treated NE4C (Fig.

7d

).

In addition, we also found that some Smarca4-regulated genes, which were associated with NTDs, exhibited decreased expression upon HTL treatment, i.e. SHH signaling pathways and their downstream target genes (Supplementary Figure

4A

)

37

; PCP signaling pathway-related genes (Supplementary Figure

4B

)

38

; and self-renewal/proliferation genes (Supplementary Figure

4C

)

39

. Meanwhile, the expression of the housekeeping genes

Gapdh

and

Actg1

was unchanged (Supplementary Figure

4D

). These results indicated that decreased expression of

Smarca4

in turn led to the decrease of some NTC-related genes and pathways to play a role in NTDs formation.

Collectively, our data from this study indicate that during HTL-treatment, the H3K79Hcy enrichment on

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

was decreased, accompanied by decreases in their expression level while the overall level of histone H3K79Hcy was increased. These results suggest that H3K79Hcy is critical for

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

expression.

Increase of H3K79Hcy with decreased expression of NTC genes

Knock-out of NTC-related genes leads to NTDs phenotypes in mice, indicating that suppression of the transcription of these genes, including

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

and

Dnmt3b

, is functionally connected to the pathogenesis of NTDs

40

–

42

. Because of the observed alteration of the transcription levels of these NTC genes under aberrant H3K79Hcy, we reasoned that aberrant H3K79Hcy might also have detrimental consequences in humans including the formation of NTDs. To test this hypothesis, we first measured Hcy levels in brain tissue samples from 10 normal fetuses and 10 NTDs cases (see Supplementary Table

1

for a summary of the information on the individual fetuses). As shown in left chart of Fig.

7e

, brain Hcy level was significantly higher in samples from NTDs cases (41.0 pmol/mg), compared to 3.3 pmol/mg in normal controls. Using the anti-H3K79Hcy antibody, western blotting analysis was performed to evaluate H3K79Hcy levels in these samples. Stronger H3K79Hcy signals were detected in NTDs samples, compared to that in controls (Fig.

7e

, middle chart). Average level of H3K79Hcy expression normalized to H3 was found to be significantly higher in NTDs samples (0.44 vs. 0.30 in controls,

p

= 0.024; Fig.

7e

, right chart).

Along with the elevation in Hcy and H3K79Hcy levels in these NTDs tissues, there was a repressed transcription of the above-mentioned NTC-related genes. Results from nanostring analysis revealed an evident reduction in average levels of the transcription of these three genes (Fig.

7f

).

Taken together, our data indicate that high Hcy levels in NTDs may result in an increase in the level of histone H3K79Hcy which may have a suppressive effect on the transcription of

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

genes, leading to the failure of NTC.

Discussion

Abnormal Hcy metabolism has been implicated in the occurrence of NTDs in a number of studies. Elevated maternal Hcy during pregnancy has been found to be associated with an increased risk of NTDs in offspring

4

–

6

,

43

–

46

. In chicken embryos, applying Hcy and HTL supplementation during early stages of chicken embryo development lead to the onset of NTDs in the embryos

47

,

48

. Similar results have been produced in the present study (Fig.

5

). All these findings suggest that high maternal Hcy is associated with the occurrence of NTDs, and that Hcy accumulation is a risk factor for NTDs. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.

Increasing evidence has implicated altered histone modifications in translating cellular metabolic states into changes in gene expression

11

,

49

. Several lines of evidence have shown that there is a strong relationship between one-carbon metabolism nutrients and epigenetic phenomena

50

,

51

. A causal link between histone methylation and nutritional status has also been demonstrated in yeast and human cells, where folate and methionine deficiency are associated with a reduction of histone methylation, mainly H3K4 methylation, and lead to changes in gene expression. In the present study, we explored the pathways from one-carbon metabolism intermediate Hcy to the onset of NTDs based on several key observations, the demonstrated increase of maternal Hcy in women who give birth to infants with NTDs, our discovery of modifications in histone KHcy as well as H3K79Hcy, and well-established altered expression of NTC genes in NTDs.

Protein homocysteinylation has been reported for a number of proteins, mostly enzymes, and result in alteration of protein function

7

,

8

,

52

. Given the connection between maternal high Hcy levels and onset of NTDs, we reasoned that the presence of Hcy would serve as a substrate to modify histones and to regulate the expression level of some NTC-related genes. From human embryonic brain samples, we identified 39 KHcy modification sites (Fig.

1b

). To our knowledge, this is the first time that homocysteinylation specific to histone in human fetal brain has been reported. Using an anti-KHcy antibody, we further demonstrated that histone homocysteinylation is a common histone modification present not only in different organs in humans, but in different species as well (Fig.

1c, d

).

We then performed an in vitro experiment to treat histones from prokaryotic expression (devoid of any modification) with HTL and to define KHcy sites under these conditions (Fig.

2e

). Furthermore, KHcy sites were also defined in NE4C cells under normal and HTL-treatment conditions (Fig.

3d

). Our data provide evidence supporting the overall fidelity of HTL treatment in vitro or in vivo for histone homocysteinylation resemble naturally occurring KHcy sites detected in fetal brain tissue samples. Although histone KHcy sites increased while HTL were used during in vitro and in vivo treatment, the most histone KHcy sites (39 Histone KHcy sites) were detected from fetal brain samples. These indicated that in the brain, histone homocysteinylation involving cellular metabolism is far more efficient than direct chemical reactions with HTL or Hcy.

Among all histone KHcy modifications, histone H3K79Hcy was naturally present in untreated NE4C cells as well as fetal brain samples, suggesting that it might be one of the key regulators for histone KHcy modifications. To investigate the possible mechanism, we performed ChIP-seq analysis in NE4C, comparing patterns of gene binding between H3K79Hcy and H3K4me3, a well-known epigenetic regulator of gene expression. Combining ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we showed that H3K4me3 was more enriched in the promoter and the gene expression level increased gradually along with an increase in ChIP density in the promoter region (Fig.

3e

), consistent with previous findings

53

. However, a significant enrichment of histone H3K79Hcy was found to be in the gene body region (Supplementary Figure

3C

), and a bioinformatics analysis showed that the gene expression level increased gradually along with an increase in ChIP density within the gene body, rather than the promoter (Fig.

6d

and Supplementary Figure

3E

). These results indicate that H3K79Hcy may regulate the expression of gene to which it bound through its enrichment in the gene body region.

We further explored the effect of H3K79Hcy on expression of NTC-related genes and focused our efforts on

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

. Among 14 epigenetic regulators required for NTC (

https://ntdwiki.wikispaces.com/Epigenetic+Regulators

), these 3 genes have been identified to be regulated by H3K79Hcy, knocking out each one of them in mice leads to NTDs

Smarca4

(also known as

Brg1

) is the essential ATPase subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and can alter the histone–DNA linkages in the target gene promoter region, slide the nucleosomes, expose the target gene promoter region to alter the specific transcription factor and its complexes for DNA accessibility, thereby regulating gene expression

56

,

57

. Our research also showed that some

Smarca4

-regulated genes, which are associated with NTDs, exhibited decreased expression upon HTL treatment, i.e. genes in the SHH signaling (Supplementary Figure

4A

)

37

; PCP signaling (Supplementary Figure

4B

)

38

; and self-renewal/proliferation genes (Supplementary Figure

4C

)

39

,

54

, suggesting that decreased expression of

Smarca4

plays a role in NTDs formation.

Binding of H3K79Hcy to these 3 genes has been verified in our studies, providing the basis for evaluating the effects of H3K79Hcy on its binding to these 3 genes and subsequent regulation on gene expression. Interestingly, in human NTDs samples where a higher level of Hcy was detected and an increase of overall H3K79Hcy was observed (Fig.

7e

), the expression of above-mentioned 3 genes were all decreased (Fig.

7f

). The answer to this dilemma lies in the results in Fig.

7

which demonstrates that there is a diminished specific binding of H3K79Hcy to these 3 genes upon HTL treatment (determined using ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR), leading to a decreased level of expression of these 3 genes (assayed using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR). Combining data from NE4C cells treated with HTL (Fig.

7a, b, d

) and that from NTDs samples (Fig.

7e, f

), suggests that higher cellular levels of HTL or Hcy confers to an elevated level of KHcy, in particular, H3K79Hcy. However, higher level of H3K79Hcy has a negative impact in its binding to aforementioned genes, resulting in a reduced gene expression of

Smarca4

,

Cecr2

, and

Dnmt3b

. Currently, we are conducting mechanistic studies to define differences in chromosomal structure, transcritomal regulations, as well as nucleosomal positioning in the context of H3K79Hcy.

It is possible that the Hcy level and histone homocysteinylation level presented in this study may not accurately reflect that of NTC at the time of neurulation because the fetuses used in this study were in at least the second trimester, long after neurulation, and NTD samples in this study were mostly spina bifida, which occurs at very early spina cord development. However, results from chicken embryo model showed that there was an increase in histone H3K79Hcy expression during brain development in high-HTL-treated chickens while a decreased expression of H3K79Hcy was detected in samples from the normal group, suggesting that abnormal H3K79Hcy expression might lead to the occurrence of NTDs in chicken.

Taken together, our findings presented in this study identify histone KHcy as a mechanism by which Hcy regulates cellular physiology and supports a model in which a shift in the cellular utilization of energy source alters gene expression in a metabolite-directed manner.

Methods

Human subjects details

The NTDs and normal control samples were from the Lüliang area of Shanxi Province in northern China from March 2004. Fetuses with NTDs were from medical abortions and had been diagnosed with spina bifida by B-mode ultrasound in the early stages of pregnancy; the sex, gestational age and general development were also recorded in detail. The pathological diagnosis of NTDs was completed by experienced pathologists in accordance with the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, codes Q00.0, Q05.9, and Q01.9 (

http://apps.who.int/classifications/

). Control fetuses that had been aborted for non-medical reasons were enrolled from the same region

46

,

58

. Any fetuses displaying pathological malformations or intrauterine growth retardation were excluded from the control group. In this study, 10 samples with the highest Hcy levels from 173 NTDs were selected, and 10 samples were selected from 178 controls. The controls were matched with gender (Female: 5–6 cases; male: 4–5 cases) and age ( < 20w: 1–2 cases; 20–30w: 7 cases; > 30w: 1–2 cases). The information collected from questionnaire during patient enrollment indicates that none of the mothers from either the controls or the NTDs group had received any folic acid supplements (please see Supplementary Table

1

for detail). The investigation was approved by the Committee of Medical Ethics of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics. Written informed consent was obtained from all mothers who participated in this study.

Culturing NE4C cells and knockdown of MetRS in HEK293T cells

NE4C cells from ATCC (ATCC number: SCRC-CRL-2925™) were cultured in Eagle MEM and seeded in a plate that had been precoated with poly-L-lysine. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 × Glutamax, 100 × nonessential amino acids, and 100 × penicillin–streptomycin, purchased from Thermo Fisher.

To investigate the source of protein homocysteine modifications, NE4C cells were starved using 1% FBS medium for 24 h, after which 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM DL-homocysteine (Hcy) (H4628, Sigma) or L-HTL hydrochloride (HTL) (H6503, Sigma) were added to the complete medium for 8 h. Cells without Hcy or HTL treatment were used as a control.

MetRS knockdown in HEK293T cells were achieved by shRNA virus infection. Interfering sequence TTAAGAAGCCTCAGTGTAA was cloned into PMKO plasmid and co-transfect it with pVSV-G and pGAG-POL plasmids into HEK293T cells to generate viruses. The viruses were obtained after incubating the transfected cells in puromycin containing medium for 36 h after transfection. The knockdown effects were verified by either RT-PCR or by western blotting. The MetRS knockdown HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1 mg/ml puromycin.

Histone extraction

Core histone proteins were extracted from the tissues or cells using acid extraction

59

. The samples was first homogenized in lysis buffer (10 ml solution containing 10 mM Tris–Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl

2

, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) and chilled on ice. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added immediately before lysis of cells, and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (1500

g

for 10 min). For the preparation of histones, nuclei were incubated with four volumes of 0.2 N sulfuric acid for overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was precipitated with 33% trichloroacetic acid and followed by centrifugation (12,000

g

for 20 min). The obtained pellet was washed with cold acetone and subsequently dissolved in distilled water. The samples were stored at −80 °C before analysis (also showed in our previous papers)[

26

].

Generation of the pan- anti- KHcy antibody

The anti-KHcy antibodies were developed according to a method previously described for the generation of the anti-KAc antibodies

60

. First 1 mg/ml Bovine Serum Album (BSA) was homocysteinylated by incubating with 1 mM HTL under room temperature for 14 h. The KHcy modified BSA was purified by passing reaction mixtures through a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column in 50 mM Tris buffer in an AKTA-FPLC system to remove organic reagents. Then the proteins were diluted in saline 0.9% (wt/vol) sodium chloride to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and were used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum were collected after four rounds of immunization and the antibodies were affinity purified using affinity purification column with cross-linked synthesized Hcy-lysine containing peptides. The reactivity and specificity of the antibodies were confirmed through a K-Hcy antigen competition experiment (Fig.

1c

) and elimination experiments (Fig.

1d

). The competition experiment was carried out by incubating the anti-KHcy antibodies with K-Hcy-lysine, while the elimination experiment was performed by incubating a membrane containing unmodified OVA, Suc-OVA, Ac-OVA, and K-Hcy-OVA with the anti-K-Hcy antibody.

HTL treatment in chicken embryos

HTL was diluted in Tyrode’s buffer (1 mM glucose, 3.5 mM potassium chloride, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.02 mM phosphate monosodium, 12 mM sodium bicarbonate). Phenol red was added to visualize the embryo and confirm that it was at the appropriate embryonic stage of development. The fertilized chicken eggs (White Leghorns, received from China agricultural university laboratory) were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 28–30 h. A total of 0.5 µl of diluted HTL buffer was micro-injected into the neural tube groove using a glass micropipette under a dissecting microscope. The eggs were sealed and incubated for another a series of days, to allow for complete development of the nervous system prior to capturing images. The control group eggs were injected with the same volume of Tyrode’s buffer and phenol red. Animal welfare and experimental procedures conformed to the Institutional Guidelines of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at China Agricultural University (Beijing, China). All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics.

MetRS overexpression plasmid generation and transfection

Human MetRS cDNA (NM_004990.3) was cloned in pRK7-Flag vector to generate MetRS expression plasmid. HEK293T and NE4C cells were used for transfecting the MetRS plasmid (received from Fudan University). A total of 12 µl of Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection reagent (11668-019, Thermo Fisher) diluted in 125 μl of Opti-MEM (51985-034, Thermo Fisher) was prepared. In addition, 4 μg of MetRS plasmid and 4 μg of empty vector were diluted with 125 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The 250 μl mixture of Lipo2000 and plasmids was added into one well. After 5–6 h, the medium was renewed and the cells were incubated for 24–96 h for further use in the following experiments.

Western blotting

Histone mixture (5 µg) was separated on a NuPAGE™ 12% Bis-Tris Gels, then transferred electrophoretically onto a Hybridization Nitrocellulose Filter. The membrane was prehybridized in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)(0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing 10% nonfat skimmed milk. Then, it was transferred to a solution containing 5% milk/TBST and primary antibody and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing with TBST buffer, the membrane was immersed in 5% milk/TBST containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Cat# SC-2048, Zhongshan Jinqiao) for 1 h. The membrane was washed with TBST buffer, developed using the ECL system, and exposed to X-ray film.

The following primary antibodies were used: H3K4me3 (39159, Active Motif), H3K9me3 (39285, Active Motif), H3K27me3 (61017, Active Motif), H3K79me2 (39923, Active Motif), methylated (εN) lysine antibody (ICP0501, ImmuneChem), acetyl lysine antibody (ICP0380, ImmuneChem), Hcy antibody (obtained from Fudan University, Shanghai, China), and H3K79Hcy antibody (Jing Tiancheng Company, Beijing, China). The following secondary antibodies purchased from Zhongshan Jinqiao Biological Company were used: rabbit IgG(H + L)/HRP (ZB-2301, ZSGB-Bio) and mouse IgG(H + L)/HRP (ZB-5305, ZSGB-Bio).

NE4C cells. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to H3K4me3, Hcy and H3K79Hcy overnight at 4°C. Normal rabbit IgG were used as negative control. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by sequencing. Indepth whole-genome DNA sequencing was performed by BGI (

www.genomics.org.cn

, BGI, Shenzhen, China). The raw sequencing image data were examined by the Illumina analysis pipeline, aligned to the

Mus musculus

reference genome (UCSC, mm9) using Bowtie 2, and further analyzed by MACS (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq;

https://github.com/taoliu/MACS

). Enriched binding peaks were generated after filtering through control input. Raw data files for ChIP sequencing have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession codes

RNA- seq and analysis

RNA samples were collected from normal cultured NE4C and HTL treated NE4C. Library construction and sequencing were performed on a BGISEQ-500 by Beijing Genomic Institution (

www.genomics.org.cn

, BGI, Shenzhen, China). Clean-tags were mapped to the reference genome and genes available at the Mice Genome. For gene expression analysis, the matched reads were calculated and then normalized to RPKM using RESM software

RNA extraction and nanostring for mRNA detection

Total RNA was extracted from the brain tissues of humans using the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada). The NanoString nCounter detection method was used to examine genes’ transcript levels in human tissues. Hybridizations were performed according to the NanoString Gene Expression Assay manual. Approximately 100 ng of each RNA sample was mixed with 20 μL of nCounter Reporter probes and 5 μL of nCounter Capture probes in hybridization buffer. The purified target/probe complexes were eluted and immobilized in a cartridge for data collection, which was conducted in the nCounter Digital Analyzer. The results were normalized to the

GAPDH

,

CLTC

and

GUSB

genes.

RT-PCR

According to the results of sequencing, several pairs of primers were designed (Supplementary Table

4

) for the primers used in this experiment. RT-PCR was performed using RT2 SYBR® Green ROX™ qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification, data acquisition and analysis were carried out using QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems, Singapore). The percentage of DNA brought down by ChIP was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method. Three independent ChIP experiments were performed for each analysis.

HPLC/MS

The tryptic digests were injected into an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Dionex, Germering, Germany) and analyzed by a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Full-scan MS spectra in the

m/z

range of 350–2000 were acquired in the Orbitrap. Twenty of the most intense ions were isolated for MS/MS analysis. The raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Fisher Scientific), searching with a database of human histone (

www.uniprot.org

, accessed October 2015). Peptides were generated from a semi-tryptic digestion with up to four missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionines as a variable modification. Precursor mass tolerance was 20 ppm and product ions were searched at 0.05 Da tolerance. Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were validated using a percolator based on

q

-values at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). The modified peptides passing the FDR were exported to a text file and processed by PRM. The area of peaks was used to represent the number of modifications.

PRM

Raw data were searched against the corresponding histone database. The modification include lysine homocysteinylation, acetylation, and mono-, di- and trimethylation were searched. The mass inclusion list involved mass, charge, polarity and the time from start and end. The full scan method was as described above. The PRM method employed an Orbitrap resolution of 30,000 (at

m/z

350) and a target AGC value of 2e5. The precursor ions of each peptide were duplexed using ± 0.8

m/z

unit windows. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.

PRM data analysis

PRM data were manually curated within the Xcalibur Qual Browser (version 4.0.27.19; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and through the use of Skyline (version 3.5.0.9319; AB Sciex). In Xcalibur Qual Browser, the determination of the area under the curve (AUC) of selected fragment ions was based on the presence of product ion signals within ± 2.5 min of the expected retention time, with mass error within ± 5 ppm. Skyline used raw files as input to generate and extract modified peptide normalized area at a 0.05

m

/

z

ion match tolerance for each PRM spectrum. The skyline detected results were further confirmed by area calculation of the raw data as shown in Supplementary Figure

HTL treatment in vitro

Purified histones, including H2a (M2502S, NEB), H2b (M2505S, NEB), H3 (M2503S, NEB) and H4 (M2504S, NEB) were selected. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in mixtures containing 0.5 mM L-HTL hydrochloride, 10 μg/50 μl histones, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM EDTA. A series of concentration (from 0 to 10 mM) and time gradients (from 0 to 14 h) were used for following experiments.

Generation of anti H3K79Hcy antibody

Anti-H3K79Hcy antibody was generated and purified from rabbit with lysine-homocysteine modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an antigen. To generate H3K79 site-specific antibody, the synthesized peptide CREIAQDFK(Hcy)TDL was used as an antigen for rabbit immunization. Antiserum was collected after four sessions of immunization. The antibody was done by AbMax Biotechnology Co., Ltd. To test the specificity of the anti-H3K79Hcy antibody, three experiments were designed as Supplementary Figure

A,

2B

and

2C

. The dot-blot results showed that H3K79Hcy antibody could strongly recognize the homocysteinylated H3K79 peptide, weakly recognized the H3K79 peptide, but almost not recognized the dimethylated H3K79 peptide, H3K27 peptide, homocysteinylated H3K27 peptide, H3K115 peptide, and homocysteinylated H3K115 peptide (Supplementary Figure

2A

). Two additional experiments were conducted to verify the specificity of the anti-H3K79Hcy antibody. A significantly stronger signal was detected with anti-H3K79Hcy antibody on homocysteinylated H3, compared to that of unmodified H3 (Supplementary Figure

2B

). However, such a strong reactivity to homocysteinylated H3 can be effectively blocked by pre-incubation with increasing amount of H3K79Hcy peptide, while baseline reactivity to unmodified H3 remains unchanged (Supplementary Figure

2B

), confirming the specificity of the anti-H3K79Hcy antibody. Supplementary Figure

2C

shows that increasing levels of histone homocysteinylation in NE4C cells was detected using anti-H3K79Hcy antibody with increasing concentration of HTL. These three experiments support the validation that anti-H3K79Hcy antibody specifically recognizes homocysteinylated H3K79.

Hcy level detection in brain tissue

Hcy level detection is set up by our laboratory

62

. Brain tissue were treated with 150 mL of 50 mM DTT and waited a 20 min period in room temperature to reduce disulfide bonds, then 200 uL of internal standard (Hcy-d4) were added. Spiked brain samples were vortexed and homogenized before a 15 min sonication and a 12,000

g

centrifuge. The supernatant were transferred to a solid phase extraction (SPE) tip in a commercial kit named EZ:faast (KH0-7337, Phenomenex), sample purification and Hcy derivatization was conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After that, the derivative Hcy was evaporated and re-dissolved using methanol–water (65: 35, v/v) containing 1 mM ammonium formate before injection. An Agilent 6410B triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with an Agilent 1200 system HPLC (Palo Alto, CA, USA) were used for LC-MS/MS analysis. Separation was performed on a Zorbax Bonus-RP column (100 mm*2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 mm particle size, Agilent Technologies, Germany) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/ min. The mobile phase was methanol–water (65: 35, v/v) containing 1 mM ammonium formate. Each sample was injected in a volume of 1 mL via an auto-sampler and separated by isocratic elution in 6.5 min. The column temperature was 35 °C. The MS/MS experiments were performed under positive-ion (ESI + ) mode with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM). The capillary voltage was set to 4 kV and the source temperature was set to 350 °C. Nitrogen served as the nebulizer gas at a flow rate of 10 L min/1 and a pressure of 45 psi. High purity nitrogen was used as the collision gas. The MRM transition for Hcy and Hcy-d4 were 350-204.1 and 354.2-208.1, respectively.

#### CECR2 - Article 4: Double whammy: the genetic variants in CECR2 and high Hcy on the development of neural tube defects
<Date>: 2023-6-22
<PMCID>: 10324518
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Neural tube defects (NTDs), which originate from the incomplete or failed closure of the neural tube during embryonic development, cause severe birth defects, including anencephaly, spina bifida and myelomeningocele (

Greene and Copp, 2014

). With a global prevalence ranging from 0.5 to >10 per 1,000 pregnancies (

Avagliano et al., 2019

;

Peake et al., 2021

), NTDs were the most predominant type of neonatal anomaly in low-income countries over the past decade (

Anane-Fenin et al., 2023

). To date, the strategy of intensifying preconception and antenatal supplementation of folic acid (FA), which has been implemented in a number of countries, has been pivotal in reducing NTDs (

Blom et al., 2006

). However, the existence of a subgroup of apparently folate-resistant NTDs, which account for an estimated one-third of NTDs, indicates that not all NTDs can be prevented with FA (

Mosley et al., 2009

;

Blencowe et al., 2010

). Therefore, we should clearly understand the causes of NTDs if we are to prevent them entirely.

Multiple complex factors are involved in the etiology of NTDs, and include genetic susceptibilities, environmental factors and unconscious genetic—environmental interactions (

Copp and Greene, 2010

; Greene and Copp, 2014). Elevation of maternal homocysteine (Hcy) levels (

Yang et al., 2017

), lower blood levels of the B-vitamin folate or inositol, maternal obesity and diabetes comprise the well-recognized environmental risk factors for NTDs. Notably, these environmental factors can also interact; for example, a deficiency of folate is considered to be the most common cause of high Hcy (HHcy) (

Stanger et al., 2004

;

Copp et al., 2013

). Additionally, with up to 70% of the variance in NTD prevalence being attributable to genetic factors (

Leck, 1974

), >200 candidate genes have been investigated and shown to induce NTDs (

Harris and Juriloff, 2010

). These include genetic polymorphisms such as C677T, and possibly A1298C, in the homocysteine remethylation gene that encodes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)

,

which may increase the risk of NTDs by approximately 1.8-fold (

Boyles et al., 2005

;

Copp and Greene, 2010

). Furthermore, genetic variants have the potential to interact with a predisposing environmental factor (e.g., maternal diabetes and folate status) to impact a NTD (

Greene and Copp, 2014

). For example, the folate one-carbon metabolism-related genes Mthfd1 and Folr1, and missense mutations of AMT or GLDC (

Copp et al., 2013

), have been associated with changes in maternal metabolism and secondary effects on the developing embryo. These observations prompted us to propose that there might be other genes with susceptibility to environmental factors associated with folate deficiency that also participate in the occurrence of NTDs.

CECR2 contains 19 exons and encodes a protein that contains both a DDT motif and a bromodomain, which is typical of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (

Banting et al., 2005

). CECR2 is a critical member of the CECR2-containing remodeling factor (CERF) complex (

Norton et al., 2022

), an imitation switch (ISWI) chromatin-remodeling complex that is typically involved in DNA replication and repair, and transcriptional regulation. CECR2 has roles in neurulation, and the loss of CECR2 in mice can induce exencephaly (a perinatal-lethal cranial NTD), or lead to implantation failure or neonates with open eyelids (

Banting et al., 2005

;

Thompson et al., 2012

;

Leduc et al., 2017

). Additionally, 74% of BALB/c mice with a hypomorphic genetrap mutation (

Cecr2

Gt45Bic

) develop exencephaly, and

Cecr2

tm1.1Hemc

mutants in both BALB/c and FVB/N strains show 96% penetrance for exencephaly (

Fairbridge et al., 2010

). Nevertheless, the specific role of CECR2 in neurulation is unknown.

We previously showed that maternal HHcy can result in decreased CECR2 transcription and the onset of NTDs (

Zhang et al., 2018

). Here, we have studied the effects of CECR2 variants found in human NTDs. Through screening of the exonic and highly conserved regions of CECR2 in 373 individuals with NTDs and 222 healthy controls, we identified nine NTD-specific rare variants in the NTD cohort. Four of these variants, all missense mutations, resulted in decreased expression of CECR2 and increased apoptosis in mouse cells. Furthermore, these effects were aggravated by the addition of HHcy treatment, but were attenuated by FA supplementation. Our study provides a mechanism for gene—environment interaction in NTDs.

Materials and methods

Human subjects

From 2005 to 2011, totally 373 Chinese Han individuals aged from gestational week (GW) 12 to 10-year-old with sporadic NTDs in this study were recruited and collected from multiple locations in the Northern area, including Shanxi, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces (

Li et al., 2020

;

Liu et al., 2018

). Also Southern area of Tianjin and Jiangsu provinces were included. All patients with phenotypes of NTDs were diagnosed by clinical pathologists. In addition, a total of 222 ethnically and geographically matched subjects aged from GW14 to 18-year-old unrelated to NTD were recruited as controls. All subjects’ parents provided written informed consent as required by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics (Beijing, China) (

Li et al., 2020

). All studies were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Genomic DNA sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted from brain tissues of both individuals with NTDs and healthy controls using a Blood and Tissue DNA kit (Qiagen). The coding region and highly conserved region DNA of CECR2 gene were fragmented and enriched. The Truseq sample preparation kit (Illumina) was then used to prepare the sample according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol. The library is built from Agilent’s Custom sureelect Enrichment Toolkit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and Agilent’s Custom Enrichment Array. The hybridization reaction was performed on the AB 2720 Thermal cycle apparatus (Life Technologies). The reaction samples were incubated for 24 h in the hybrid mixture at 65°C and the lid was heated at 105°C. The SureDesign website uses Agilent technology to design custom captured oligonucleotides. The capture yield is enriched under the following cycle conditions:98°C 30 s; 10 cycles at 98°C for 10 s; 60°C 30 s; 72°C 30 s, 72°C 5 min. Base consolidation is then performed on a Genomic Analyzer II sequencer (Illumina). The sequencing results were consistent with UCSC GRCh37/hg19 with reference to the human genome was detected using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner v6.4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) repeats were sequenced and removed using Picard software. Single nucleotide variation (SNVS) was invoked using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and VarScan, and the SNVS were then labeled with ANNOVAR. Genotype calls were made using BayesAss 3.03 and identified variants were screened using dbSNP and Genome 1,000 browsers to identify shared variants in cases and controls. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm missense mutations.

Functional prediction of CECR2 variants

To predict the damage of 9 CECR2 variants to CECR2 protein function and structure, the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) (

http://sift-dna.org

) (

Sim et al., 2012

) and PolyPhen-2 (

http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/

) algorithms were used for analysis the effect of coding variants on protein function. T-Coffee (

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/tcoffee/

) was used for conservative analysis of amino acids.

NE-4C cell culture, HTL and FA treatment

As described in our previous paper (

Bai et al., 2018

), NE-4C cells (ATCC number: SCRC-CRL-2925™) (

Schlett and Madarasz, 1997

) purchased from the Stem Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Science. NE-4C were cultured on T25 cell culture dishes, which was pre-coated with 10 g/mL Poly-D-Lysine (Millipore) before 2 h passage. The complete medium composition is: 90% Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) (ThermoFisher); 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10099, Gibco); 1% GlutaMAX, and 1% non-essential amino acid.

To stimulate HHcy exposure, cells were pre-cultured in serum-free medium for 12 h, then 0.5 mM or 1 mM Homocysteine-thiolactone (HTL) (H6503, Sigma) was added to each group, 10% FBS was reintroduced, and cells were further cultured for 8 h for follow-up experiments. Cells without HTL treatment were used as a blank. In addition, FA (FA7876, sigma) is directly dissolved in the culture medium with or without HTL at 8 mg/L concentration.

CECR2 plasmids and transfection

Wild-type (WT) human CECR2 and variant open-reading frames (ORFs), were synthesized by OriGene Technologies Co., Ltd. and were cloned into the expression vector pCMV6-AC. All WT and variant plasmids were validated by direct DNA sequencing.

A total of 10 µL of Lipofectamine

®

3,000 transfection reagent (L3000075, Thermo Fisher) diluted in 125 μL of Opti-MEM (51985-034, Thermo Fisher) was prepared. In addition, 5 μg of plasmid or 5 μg of empty vector were diluted with 125 μL of Opti-MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The 250 μL mixture of Lipo3000 and plasmids was added into one well. After incubated for 24–96 h, cells were harvested for further use in the following experiments. The grouping information is as follows: cells transfected empty vector as “NC” group; Cells transfected with the mutant are named according to the mutant type.

Western blotting (WB)

Total cell lysate total proteins were separated by 4%-12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to WB assays with the primary antibody: anti-Cecr2 (PA5-82045, Thermofisher), anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) (#9661, CST). The data were standardized to the Gapdh (Anti-GAPDH, ab8245, abcam). Immunocomplexes were detected with a West Pico ECL kit (Thermo Scientific). The band intensities were determined using Image Lab software and expressed relative to Gapdh.

Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) assays

To investigate the role of CECR2 mutants in apoptosis of NE-4C cells, we counted apoptotic cells under different culture conditions. After treatment, the cells were digested with EDTA-free trypsin, washed with cold PBS, and doubly stained with annexin-V and PI (KeyGen). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the green fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel tests annexin-V and red fluorescent for PI. The percentage of apoptotic cells in 10,000 cells was measured.

Immunofluorescence (IF)

The cells were first washed twice with cold 1×PBS and treated as follows: fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then permeated in 0.5%Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min, and blocked with 1 × PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.3M glycine for 60 min. Cells were incubated with CECR2 antibody diluted in 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4°C. After washing, secondary antibodies with Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150077, Abcam) were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. The nuclei were restained with DAPI. Images were pictured on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis

In the analysis of variation rate of human subjects, the difference between the case and control group was evaluated by Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. In the cell experiment, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) plus post-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance. All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All reported

p

values were 2 sides,

p

< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Rare variants identified in CECR2

With the aim of identifying potential target genes for prevention of NTDs, we screened a total of 373 NTD cases and 222 healthy controls using next-generation capture target sequencing. This analysis identified nine nonsynonymous amino acid changes within the protein encoded by CECR2. All nine of the variants were found among 12 NTD patients and were absent in all 222 of the controls. The mutation rate of CECR2 was thus confirmed to be 3.22% (12/373) in the patients affected by NTDs. All variants were rare, with a frequency of <0.05% as reported by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (

Table 1

). All nucleotide changes were found in the heterozygous form.

Score ranges from 0-1, the closer the score is to 1, the greater the probability that amino acid replacement will damage the structure and function of protein.

The nine nonsynonymous variants detected in NTD cases were as follows: p.Glu327Val (c.980A>T), p.Val376Met (c.1126G>A), p.Thr521Ser (c.1562C>G), p.His634Leu (c.1901A>T), p.Gln647Arg (c.1940A>G), p.Gly701Arg (c.2101G>A), p.Gly868Arg (c.2602G>A), p.His941Arg (c.2822A>G) and p.Pro1023Leu (c.3068C>T) (

Figure 1

). Among these missense changes, p.Thr521Ser was located in the bromodomain. Amino acid conservation analysis showed that four of these mutations (p.Glu327Val, p.Thr521Ser, p.Gly701Arg and p.Gly868Arg) affected highly conserved amino acid residues, while the other five involved less conserved amino acid residues (

Table 1

). On the basis of bioinformatics, including analysis of amino acids property changes, conservation, localization in vital domains, and damage to protein structure or function using the SIFT/PolyPhen-2 algorithm, we selected the following four mutations for functional studies: p.Glu327Val (c.980A>T), p.Thr521Ser (c.1562C>G), p.Gly701Arg (c.2101G>A) and p.Gly868Arg (c.2602G>A).

Clinical features of NTD patients carrying CECR2 mutations

Six patients carrying a mutation at one of the four selected sites presented varying clinical features of NTDs. The p.Gly868Arg variant was detected in two patients, p.Glu327Val was found in two patients, and both of the remaining two mutations had only one carrier each. The only CECR2 mutation that was located in the bromodomain of the protein, p.Thr521Ser, was identified in a 4-year-old male patient (TJ-QS34) who was affected by a C2-3 vertebral fusion, an untypical NTD phenotype. The CECR2 p.Glu327Val (c.980A>T) substitution was found in two female fetuses (D41 and D66). D41 presented with congenital hydrocephalus and open lumbosacral spina bifida at 20 weeks of gestation. D66 presented with anencephaly and open spina bifida at 17 weeks of gestation, and was also affected by atelectasis, visceral congestion and single umbilical artery. A male patient (D63) carrying the CECR2 p.Gly701Arg (c.2101G>A) variant also presented with anencephaly at 25 weeks of gestation, and was affected by multiple abnormalities, including meningoencephalocele, atelectasis, visceral congestion, cheilopalatognathus, symphysodactylia, equinovarus and absence of the eyes and nose. Two female fetuses (D95 and D174) had the same mutation, CECR2 p.Gly868Arg (c.2602G>A). Although both patients presented with spina bifida, there were phenotypic variations: D95 had open occipitocervical thoracolumbar spina bifida, while D174 had non-open thoracolumbar spina bifida. In addition to spina bifida and other systemic defects, D95 was also affected by anencephaly, the most severe type of NTD, while D174 was affected by congenital hydrocephalus, which is commonly associated with spina bifida (

Mutations of CECR2 affected protein expression of CECR2

Given that reduction of Cecr2 in mice resulted in lethal exencephaly (

Leduc et al., 2017

;

Niri et al., 2021

), we addressed the question of whether the four CECR2 rare missense variants found in human patients would affect CECR2 protein expression

in vitro

. A wild-type (WT) CECR2 expression plasmid (WT group) and an empty control plasmid (NC group) were constructed and transiently transfected into NE-4C, a mouse E9 neural ectoderm cell line (

Demeter et al., 2004

). Western blotting assays revealed that protein levels of CECR2 did not differ between the NC group and the Blank group (normally cultured cells), but were remarkably higher in the WT group. We also constructed expression plasmids for each of the variants, and presumed that the quality of transfection of each expression plasmid would be equivalent. Expression levels of the p.E327V, p.T521S and p.G868R variants of CECR2 were significantly lower than that of WT group; notably, p.T521S led to a particularly significant decrease in total CECR2 expression (

Figure 2

). By contrast, expression of the p.G701R variant was comparable to that of WT, indicating that this mutation did not affect protein expression of CECR2. Furthermore, cells transfected with a recombinant variant containing all four mutations (4Mut) of CECR2 showed significantly decreased expression compared with WT CECR2 or the p.E327V single mutant, suggesting that multiple mutations could worsen stability of the protein.

FIGURE 2

Effects of CECR2 missense variants on CECR2 protein expression. NE-4C cells were transfected with wild-type (WT), empty vector plasmid, or the 4 selected CECR2 variants. WB was performed with whole-cell proteins lysate and analyzed proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Cecr2 antibody (Upper), and anti-Gapdh antibody (lower), which was served as loading control.

The p.T521S variant and HHcy synergistically decreased CECR2 expression

NTDs are the result of interactions between genes and environment. On the basis of our previous research on the reduction in CECR2 gene expression induced by HHcy (

Zhang et al., 2018

), we wondered whether the genetic variation in Cecr2 and HHcy might have a synergistic effect on the expression of CECR2. First, by employing Western blotting analysis, we confirmed that CECR2 protein expression was indeed downregulated in NE-4C cells treated with HTL, a highly reactive Hcy metabolite (

Mei et al., 2020

). Furthermore, the reduction in CECR2 expression was stronger in cells treated with 1 mM HTL than in those treated with 0.5 mM HTL, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect of HTL (

Figure 3A

). Next, we examined the effect of HTL treatment on CECR2 expression in cells transfected with the p.T521S plasmid. The expression of CECR2 in the p.T521S + 1 mM HTL was significantly lower than that in the HTL-treated group or the untreated p.T521S group, suggesting that the p.T521S mutant and HHcy could work synergistically to reduce CECR2 protein expression (

Figure 3B

). Additionally, to further demonstrate that HTL can aggravate the disruption of CECR2 protein expression, we transfected in 1 mM HTL-treated cells with WT, p.E327V, p.G701R or p.G868R, or 4Mut plasmid. As shown in

Figure 3C

, compared with the Blank + HTL and NC + HTL groups, CECR2 expression did not change significantly in the WT + HTL group, suggesting that, in cells carrying a CECR2 overexpression plasmid, simultaneous HTL treatment can restore the normal expression of CECR2. However, in cells treated with p.E327V + HTL, p.G868R + HTL or 4Mut + HTL, the expression levels of CECR2 were still significantly lower than that in the WT + HTL group, which was consistent with the results in

Figure 2

. Collectively, these cell-based results demonstrated that HTL can co-regulate CECR2 expression with the p.T521S, p.E327V or p.G868R mutants of CECR2.

The p.T521S variant cooperated with HHcy to induce increased apoptosis of NE-4C cells

Given that an increase in apoptosis is one of the most common cellular changes observed in studies of gene-targeted embryos that produce NTDs (

Copp and Greene, 2010

), we aimed to examine expression of cleaved caspase-3, a molecule related to both apoptosis and NTDs (

Houde et al., 2004

;

Zhou et al., 2018

), in cells transfected with the Cecr2 mutants. As shown in

Figure 4A

, the p.T521S-transfected cells exhibited enhanced apoptosis compared to that in WT-transfected cells. Additionally, 1 mM HTL treatment combined with p.T521S transfection led to stronger enhancement of cleaved caspase-3 expression than p.T521S transfection alone. This trend of increased cleaved caspase-3 expression was also found in cells transfected with 4Mut. To test for the possibility of impairment of apoptosis at the cellular level, we performed annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) assays. Consistent with the increased cleaved caspase-3 activity, the percentage of apoptotic cells was decreased in both the p.T521S and 4Mut transfectants compared with that in the WT transfectants. By contrast, when the cultures of p.T521S or 4Mut transfectants were superimposed with HTL treatment, the percentages of apoptotic cells increased significantly compared with untreated cultures (

p

< 0.05;

Figure 4B

). Taken together, these data suggested that the decrease in CECR2 protein resulting from CECR2 gene mutation or co-treatment with HTL led to cell apoptosis.

FA supplementation rescued the reduction in CECR2 caused by CECR2 variants, with or without HHcy

FA supplementation is effective in preventing the occurrence of NTDs (

Crider et al., 2022

), leading us to wonder whether FA could compensate for the abnormal CECR2 expression caused by the genetic variation in CECR2 in patients with NTDs. First, we examined the effect of 8 mg/L FA supplementation on cells transfected with the p.T521S variant, with or without co-treatment with 0.5 mM HTL or 1 mM HTL. As shown in

Figures 5A, B

, FA supplementation significantly increased the expression level of CECR2 in all three treatment groups. Additionally, FA supplementation had the almost same effect on cells transfected with 4Mut plasmid. To further elucidate the distribution and expression of CECR2 at the cellular level, we used the IF method to detect cells transfected with p.T521S and superimposed with different treatments. As shown in

Figures 5C, D

, CECR2 was mainly expressed in the cell nucleus. Compared with the p.T521S-transfected group, CECR2 expression was significantly downregulated in the p.T521S + HTL group. Supplementation of FA in both of these groups effectively increased the expression of CECR2 in the nucleus. FA supplementation also significantly downregulated cleaved caspase-3 expression in p.T521S- or 4Mut-transfected cells superimposed with HTL treatment (

Figure 5E

), suggesting that FA effectively reversed the damage caused by CECR2 variants and HTL treatment.

Discussion

In this study, we correlated CECR2 gene mutations and HHcy with CECR2 protein expression in NE-4C cells using integrative analysis of Western blotting and PI assay data. Our results indicated that three specific mutations identified in human NTDs (p.E327V, p.T521S, and p.G868R) led to reduced CECR2 protein expression, which further induced cell apoptosis. We propose that the increased cell apoptosis might have been responsible for the failure of neural tube closure in these patients. These effects were more severe when combined with HHcy treatment, but were effectively rescued by FA supplementation. Our results provide new evidence for the interaction between gene variants and environmental factors involved in the NTDs.

In our prior study, we identified four rare mutations in the CASPASE9 gene across 7 NTD samples and eight rare mutations in the DNAAF1 gene from 9 NTD patients (

Miao et al., 2016

;

Liu et al., 2018

). In this current research, we detected 9 point mutations in the CECR2 gene within 12 samples among 373 NTD cases. These low-frequency genetic variants alone may not directly cause NTDs; however, the simultaneous presence of multiple gene variants could have a synergistic effect on the occurrence of NTDs. For instance, variants in the CYP26B1 gene, occurring concurrently with other variants in neural tube-related genes such as CELSR3 and REST, were hypothesized to be associated with the craniorachischisis phenotype (

Zou et al., 2020

). The risk of NTDs was three times greater in subjects carrying both heterozygous MTHFR C677T and MTR A2756G genotypes compared to those with wild-type homozygous AA and CC genotypes (

Kumari et al., 2022

). Moreover, an accumulation of approximately nine SloFVs (singleton loss-of-function variants) represents a genomic threshold for NTD risk, regardless of genetic background or ethnicity (

Chen et al., 2018

). These findings emphasize the importance of investigating low-frequency gene point mutations for identifying high-risk NTD groups, which may offer targeted sites for clinical personalized therapy.

Reduction or loss of CECR2 in mice led to lethal exencephaly (

Leduc et al., 2017

). Several point mutations in CECR2 that also resulted in exencephaly include mice with

Cecr2

tm1.1Hemc

and the hypomorphic genetrap mutation

Cecr2

Gt45Bic

(

Fairbridge et al., 2010

). Among the six clinical NTD cases with CECR2 variants in our cohort (

Table 2

), the most common NTD phenotypes were spina bifida and anencephaly (exencephaly), and these patients also exhibited meningoencephalocele, hydrocephalus and other deformities, suggesting that the NTD phenotype associated with CECR2 mutation may be diverse.

Verification of the protein expression of the CECR2 mutants in the NE-4C cell model (

Figure 2

) showed that three of the variants (p.E327V, p.T521S, and p.G868R) exhibited significantly lower expression compared with WT, and one did not (p.G701R). Notably, the 4Mut variant showed a greater reduction in CECR2 protein than the single-point mutant p.E327V. Previous reports showed that

Cecr2

Gt45Bic

homozygous mutants had a wider distance between the cranial neural folds, while

Cecr2

Gt45Bic

heterozygous embryos had a slight delay in neural tube closure (

Dawe et al., 2011

). Together, these data suggested that the CECR2 variants may have a degree of dosage sensitivity.

At present, the molecular mechanism of NTDs induced by reduction of CECR2 protein is unclear. Despite its DNA repair function, CECR2 was not required for double-strand break repair in primary neurospheres (

Elliott et al., 2020

). In a study using embryonic stem cells, CCAR2, LUZP1, and the ISWI proteins SMARCA5 and SMARCA1 were found to combine with CECR2 to structure and stabilize CERF components (

Niri et al., 2021

). Although no studies have reported on the involvement of these ISWI proteins in CECR2 variant-related NTDs, in the 11–14 somite stage,

Cecr2

Gt45Bic

mutant embryos exhibited an approximately 7- to 14-fold reduction in CECR2 transcription from normal levels. This reduction resulted in downregulation of Alx1/Cart1 and Dlx5, which when mutated can result in exencephaly in mice (

Fairbridge et al., 2010

), indicating that CECR2 mutants may be involved in NTDs by inducing downstream changes in gene expression. This phenomenon was also observed in our study: the NTD-related gene encoding caspase-3 (

Urase et al., 2003

;

Houde et al., 2004

) was abnormally activated in the p.T521S and 4Mut CECR2 mutants (

Figure 4

).

Our results also highlighted the interaction between Hhcy, an environmental factor, and CECR2 mutations in the inhibition of CECR2 and activation of apoptosis. Their destructive effects were more serious than those caused by the single CECR2 mutants or HHcy treatment alone, indicating a superimposition effect of HHcy and CECR2 variation, which was effectively attenuated by FA supplementation (

Figures 3

–

5

). Both folate deficiency and HHcy are environmental factors for increased risk of NTDs (

Zhang et al., 2018

;

Wang et al., 2021

;

Wang et al., 2023

). Furthermore, folate deficiency can lead to HHcy through one-carbon metabolism (

Bhatia and Singh, 2015

;

Kaye et al., 2020

), implying a crosslink between these two factors. Our results also suggested that the two had a synergistic regulatory effect on CECR2, in which the CECR2 mutants participated. Additionally, the interaction between HHcy and variation of the MTHFR gene, including the C677T and A1298C mutations, was shown to increase susceptibility to vascular diseases and neural tube defects in the progeny (

Pawlak and Strauss, 2001

). Taken together, our data expanded the previous results, emphasizing the increased susceptibility to NTDs by the synergistic regulatory effect of HHcy and CECR2 mutation.

In this study, we identified and described nine rare mutations of the CECR2 gene in NTD cases and demonstrated that three of the variants (p.T521S, p.E327V and p.G868R) impaired protein expression, suggesting loss-of-function variation. We also showed that the p.T521S variant activated apoptosis, which became more serious under HHcy conditions. Our findings confirm the association of apoptosis with human NTDs and highlight the effect of gene—environment interactions in this complex disease.

#### CECR2 - Article 5: The nuclear factor CECR2 promotes somatic cell reprogramming by reorganizing the chromatin structure
<Date>: 2020-11-23
<PMCID>: 7948406
<Full Text Content>:
Somatic cells can be reprogramed into pluripotent stem cells by overexpression of a set of nuclear factors Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc (OKSM) or Yamanaka factors (

1

) in mouse, or Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/Lin28 in human (

2

), alternatively. This revolutionary technic, which was termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), promised a great opportunity in regeneration medicine. Previously, the reprogramming by OKSM was low in efficiency and dynamics, and the use of oncogene c-Myc, raising the concern of tumorigenicity for the resulting iPSCs. Thus, the alteration of the reprogramming factors, especially the use of nononcogenes or other non-Yamanaka factors, will offer us a safer somatic cell reprogramming technique and new insight(s) for the underlying mechanism in somatic cell reprogramming. Indeed, a set of nuclear factors were reported to play roles in iPSC induction by replacing or combining with the Yamanaka factors. Generally, these nuclear factors can be categorized into two groups: (1) transcriptional factors, which can facilitate somatic cell reprogramming by binding to specific nuclear sequences or motifs, such as

Glis1

(

3

),

Nr5a2

(

4

),

Sall4

(

5

,

6

),

Esrrb

(

),

Dax1

(

8

),

Zscan4

(

9

),

Tbx3

(

10

), and

Prdm14

(

11

); (2) epigenetic regulators, which facilitate somatic cell reprogramming by altering the chromatin structure or DNA/histone modifications, such as

Tet1

(

12

,

13

),

Brg1

(

14

). Despite the discovery of a set of nuclear factors that facilitate reprogramming, the systematic comparison of their effects, especially in efficiency and dynamics, on reprogramming is lacking. A function ranking of these factors on reprogramming may help us to diagnose the key points of the underlying mechanisms systematically and comprehensively.

Previously, we reported a combination of seven factors reprogramming cocktails (

Nanog-Esrrb-Glis1-Jdp2-Kdm2b-Sall4-Mkk6

) (

15

), in which the dropout of Sall4 led a max reduction in the reprogramming efficiency, suggesting an outstanding role for Sall4 in cell fate determination. Consistently, Sall4 is reported to play an important role in a range of biological processes, such as somatic cell reprograming (

5

), tumorigenesis, and early embryonic development (

16

). However, the underlying mechanism for such an important role remains unclear. In this study, by comparing the efficiency and dynamics of a set of nuclear factors on somatic cell reprogramming, we confirm the critical role of

Sall4

on somatic cell reprogramming and identified that a new factor Cecr2, a histone acetyl-lysine reader, can promote the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming as an effect of Sall4, attempting to improve our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cell fate transition.

Results

Sall4 promotes OSK reprogramming

Previously, we have reported a group of 7F factors (

Nanog-Esrrb-Glis1-Jdp2-Kdm2b-Sall4-Mkk6

) that can reprogram mouse fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells with a ∼10% efficiency (

15

). In order to see any synergistic or cumulative effect(s) with the classic Yamanaka factors, we performed reprogramming experiments by adding each of the seven factors into Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 (

Fig. 1

A

), and showed that five of the seven factors promote OKS-induced reprogramming (

Fig. 1

B

and

Fig. S1

,

A

–

B

). Notably, Sall4, a member of the spalt-like family members (

16

), is the most powerful one among them, in agreement with earlier works (

17

,

18

). We then further examined the reprogramming dynamics for Sall4 in the context of OKS-induced reprogramming with DsRed as Control and showed that Sall4 could promote iPS cell generation as early as day 3 when no iPSC colonies appear in the control group, and finally achieved ∼16% efficiency at day 7, comparing with 7% reprogramming efficiency in the control group (

Sall4 reinforces reprogramming by opening and closing unique chromatin loci

To reveal any new insight or mechanism for Sall4 in the process of somatic cell reprogramming, we performed time-lapse RNA-seq for OKS+Sall4– or OKS+DsRed–induced reprogramming at day 0, day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) for RNA-seq data showed a similar but distinct path from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (

Fig. 2

A

), with an end point at day 7 more closer to ESCs in OKS-Sall4 than in OKS-DsRed, consistent with the fact that the pluripotent genes such as

Nanog

,

Esrrb

, and

Dppa3

were expressed much higher in OKS-Sall4 samples than in OKS-DsRed samples (

Fig. S2

,

A

–

B

). More importantly, we showed that 921 genes are upregulated and 753 genes are downregulated by Sall4 overexpression, respectively (

Fig. 2

B

). We further showed the sequential activation of the key pluripotent genes by heatmap in a day-by-day manner (

Fig. 2

C

). It is quite clear that the pluripotent genes are activated faster in the OKS+Sall4 group than in the OKS+DsRed group. Consistently, among the GO terms derived from Sall4 upregulated genes are terms such as stem cell population maintenance, maintenance of cell number, and regionalization, whereas among the GO terms derived from the Sall4 downregulated genes are terms such as cellular response to interferon-beta and positive regulation of defense response (

Fig. 2

D

). We then performed ATAC-seq and showed by PCA analysis that, similar to RNA-seq, OKS+Sall4 modulates the chromatin structure toward an ESC-like state more quickly than OKS+DsRed (

Fig. 2

E

). We further investigated the chromatin accessibility dynamics as we described previously (

Fig. 2

F

) (

17

). We show that, in general, the total number of OC, CO, or PO peaks are quite similar, with 3151 CO peaks, 59,075 OC peaks, and 16,700 PO peaks shared under both conditions (

Fig. 2

G

). Specifically, we found that Sall4 opens the loci of pluripotent genes such as

Nanog

and

Zfp42

and closes those of fibroblast/mesenchymal genes such as

Snai1

and

Zeb2

, suggesting the important role for sall4 in activating and silencing critical genes (

).

Cecr2 as a downstream effector of Sall4

To further investigate the downstream effector(s) of Sall4 for promoting reprogramming, we first reanalyzed the time-course RNA-Seq data for the 7F factors-induced reprogramming we reported previously (

15

). By comparing the gene expression profiles, we generated a panel of candidate genes regulated by Sall4 (

Fig. S3

A

). GO analysis showed that genes responsible for stem cell population maintenance, stem cell differentiation, and stem cell proliferation are upregulated by Sall4 in 7F-induced reprogramming (

Fig. S3

B

). We then compared the expression of stem cell–related genes in both OKS+Sall4– and 7F-induced reprogramming system and showed by Venn diagram for the common or specific genes regulated by Sall4 between the two systems (

).

We then over-expressed these nine genes in the OKS-induced reprogramming system and found that Cecr2 is the only hit that could significantly promote somatic cell reprogramming (

Fig. 3

A

,

Fig. S3

F

). We further measured the dynamics of iPSC colonies generated by Cecr2 with Oct4-GFP reporter MEFs and showed that Cecr2 mainly promoted reprogramming at the late stage of reprograming (

Fig. 3

,

B

–

C

). To further confirm these observations, we use Oct4-GFP/Dppa5a-Tdtomato double reporter MEFs as the starting cells and show very similar results (

Fig. 3

D

and

Fig. S3

G

). Consistently, Cecr2 is not activated without Sall4 in the 7F reprogramming system (

Fig. 3

E

), whereas it is activated significantly when Sall4 is over-expressed in the OKS reprogramming system (

Fig. 3

F

). These data suggest that Cecr2 may be regulated by Sall4 directly. To test this further, we performed ChIP(Chromatin Immunoprecipitation)-seq experiments with Sall4 antibody in mESC (

Fig. 3

G

) and detected peaks in the TSS region of Cecr2 locus where open chromatin is evident with ATAC-seq. To test the significance of these peaks, we constructed two reporters by inserting two fragments near Cecr2 TSS as illustrated and found that Sall4 can activate both constructs with luciferase activity (

Fig. 3

H

), suggesting that Sall4 regulated the expression of Cecr2 by directly binding to the transcription start site(TSS) region. We further showed that Cecr2 can slightly replace Sall4 in 7F-induced reprograming functionally (

Fig. 3

I

), whereas there was no synergistic effect with Sall4 in OKS-induced reprogramming (

Fig. S3

H

).We further showed that iPSC colonies derived from OKS+Cecr2 were similar to ESCs in morphology (

Fig. S3

I

) and RNA expression profile (

Fig. S3

J

). These data suggested that Cecr2 is a downstream effector of Sall4 in somatic cell reprogramming.

Cecr2 facilitates reprogramming by reorganizing chromatin

To further investigate the mechanism through which Cecr2 facilitates OKS reprogramming, we performed RNA-seq on OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed reprogramming cells at D0, D1, D3, D5, and D7. PCA analysis shows little differences between OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed samples (

Fig. 4

A

). Yet, pluripotent genes, such as Fzd10, Zfp42, and Zscan10, Fbxo15, have higher expression levels at later stage when Cecr2 overexpressed (

Fig. 4

B

), consistent with the higher efficiency. Furthermore, we can identify 615 genes upregulated and 396 downregulated by Cecr2, respectively (

Fig. 4

C

). Gene Ontology or GO analysis reveals that genes upregulated by Cecr2 are enriched in GO terms such as maintenance of cell number, stem cell population maintenance, chromosome organization, and DNA repair, and those downregulated by Cecr2 as regulation of ribonuclease activity, axonogenesis, regulation of nuclease activity, etc. (

Fig. 4

).

The discrepancy between the overall RNA-seq results and select gene expression in

Figure 4

versus

Figure 4

,

B

–

C

suggests that Cecr2 may regulate only a specific set of genes. To confirm this, we performed ATAC-seq on OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed reprogramming cells at D0, D1, D3, D5, and D7. Indeed, unlike RNA-seq data, PCA analysis for ATAC-seq data demonstrates quite clear divergent paths between OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed (

Fig. 4

E

). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, the total number of CO, OC, or PO peaks between the two conditions are quite similar (

Fig. 4

F

), with 4404 CO peaks, 55,406 OC peaks, and 17,565 PO peaks shared in both conditions (

Fig. 4

G

). However, the chromatin loci near pluripotent genes such as Zfp42 and Tcl1 are opened more quickly in the Cecr2 group than in the DsRed control group (

Fig. 4

H

), suggesting that Cecr2 promoted reprogramming by reorganizing chromatin structure at late stage of reprogramming. To further investigate the similarities or differences upon the impact to the pluripotent regulation network between Cecr2 and Sall4, we compared the RNA-seq data from OKS+DsRed, OKS+Sall4, and OKS+Cecr2 by heatmap and Gene Ontology analysis and further compared them by using a set of stem cell–related genes and showed that 8 genes such as

T

,

,

are regulated by both CECR2 and SALL4; 3 genes such as Sall4, Sema4a, and Nrtn are regulated by CECR2; 26 genes such as

Tet1

,

Sall1

,

Tbx3

,

Tfap2c

,

Lin28a

, and

are regulated by SALL4, respectively. (

Fig. 4

,

Table S3

). We also compared the chromatin accessibility dynamics data from OKS+DsRed, OKS+Sall4, and OKS+Cecr2, and PCA analysis showed that the chromatin state of Cecr2 is very close to Sall4 group at the late stage of reprogramming (

Fig. S4

,

A

–

C

). These data suggested that CECR2 plays a significant role in reorganizing chromatin in the late stage of reprogramming.

The DDT domain is essential for the reprogramming activity of CECR2

CECR2 is a multidomain transcription factor (

19

) that may modulate chromatin remodeling through its DDT (involved in chromatin remodeling with ISWI), BRD (bromodomain, binds acetylated lysine residue), AT hook, or NLS domains separately or in combination (

Fig. 5

A

). To see which one is responsible for enhancing reprogramming, we generated a set of constructs as shown in

Figure 5

A

and show that the deletion of the DDT domain results in loss of ability to promote OKS reprogramming (

Fig. 5

B

). Previously, Cecr2 was reported to remodel the chromatin structure by forming a complex with SNF2L(SMARCA1) (

18

)，a member of the ISWI family of protein. By co-overexpressing CECR2-HA and SMARCA-3×FLAG in 293 cells, we confirmed this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) experiment (

Fig. 5

C

) and further showed that the DDT domain was necessary for this protein–protein interaction (

Fig. 5

D

). Furthermore, we checked this interaction by IP-MS experiment and showed by heatmap that CECR2 could enrich SMARCA1, whereas Cecr2-DTT could not (

Fig. 5

E

,

Fig. S5

A

). Consistently, GO analysis for CECR2-specific interaction proteins showed a significant enrichment in GO term for chromatin remodeling (

Fig. 5

F

,

Fig. S5

B

). These data indicated that CECR2 regulates somatic cell reprogramming by DTT domain–mediated chromatin remodeling.

CECR2 is dispensable for pluripotency

To further investigate the role Cecr2 may play in pluripotency and differentiation, we inactivated

Cecr2

by CRISPR-Cas9–mediated gene editing in mESC (

Fig. 6

A

) and confirmed the inactivation of Cecr2 at RNA (

Fig. 6

B

) and protein levels (

Fig. 6

C

). Cecr2 single or double allele knockout ESC are very similar to WT ESC in morphology (

Fig. 6

D

), expression of pluripotent genes (

Fig. 6

E

), and also the three germ layer markers expression when undergoing embryoid bodies differentiation

in vitro

(

Fig. 6

F

). These data demonstrate that Cecr2 is dispensable for pluripotency or early embryonic development. We further tested the development potential of double allele knockout ESC by injecting the cells into diploid or tetraploid embryos followed by a transfer to pseudo pregnant mouse (

Fig. 6

G

). No live embryos were obtained at 13.5 d.p.c(days post coitum) in tetraploid injection group, whereas 10 live chimera embryos were obtained in the diploid injection group (

Fig. S6

A

), with 2 of 10 showing typical neural tube defected exencephaly (

Fig. 6

H

). We further purified Cere2 KO MEFs by puromycin selection for MEFs derived from E13.5 chimera embryos (

Fig. 6

H

). The Cecr2 KO MEF could be reprogramed into iPSC colonies successfully at an efficiency of ∼5% (

Fig. 6

I

). Consistently, knockdown of Cecr2 by shRNA shows little impact on the reprogramming efficiency (

Fig. S6

B

). These data suggested that Cecr2 is not essential for iPSC generation. However, Sall4 promotes reprogramming more significantly in WT MEFs than in Cecr2 KO MEFs (

Fig. 6

J

). These data suggested that SALL4 promotes somatic cell reprogramming partially by CECR2.

Discussion

Transcriptional factor–based somatic reprogramming is a promising tool for both the study of fundamental mechanism in cell biology and the cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine. A challenge regarding optimization and standardization of this technic is the identification of a gene set that can achieve rapid and efficient iPSC generation in a quantifiable and predictable way. Previously, we demonstrated that Sall4 is the most indispensable transcriptional factor among a new set of 7F reprogramming factor cocktails by which high-quality iPSC colonies could be achieved rapidly and efficiently (

15

). In this study, we first confirmed the significant role of Sall4 overexpression in the classic Yamanaka factors Oct4/Sox2/Klf4–induced somatic cell reprogramming and further investigated the chromatin accessibility and gene expression dynamics. Importantly, we identified Cecr2, a histone acetyl-lysine reader, is an important responder of SALL4 in somatic cell reprogramming. These results indicate that Cecr2 acts as an effector of Sall4 to modulate the landscape of chromatin accessibility (

Fig. 7

), which improved our understanding for transcription factors-induced cell fate transition in lineage specification,

trans

-differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming.

Figure 7

A model for Sall4-Cecr2–mediated somatic cell reprogramming.

During somatic cell reprogramming, Cecr2 was upregulated by SALL4’s binding to its promoter region. The resulting CECR2 protein formed an SNF2L contained chromatin remodeling complex, which promotes somatic cell reprograming in the late stage.

In addition to the classic Yamanaka factors, a series of transcriptional factors have been reported to mediate somatic cell reprogramming (

19

). Among them, Oct4 was regarded to be the most important one, as single Oct4 alone can reprogram MEFs into the pluripotent state (

20

). Previously, Sall4 has been described as a “star” factor that links between stem cells, development, and cancer (

16

), and amounts of regulators, partners and targets of SALL4 were identified. Recently, our finding indicated that Sall4 showed an increasing importance beyond other reprogramming factors by a dropout assay in a newly setup 7F reprogramming cocktails (

15

). The identification of CECR2 extends the reprogramming factor family members. More importantly, CECR2 has been reported to be a member of an important family of chromatin modification complexes, and this finding will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Sall4 regulates somatic reprogramming through epigenetic mechanisms, in particular by altering chromatin accessibility.

Chromatin modification complexes such as BAF have been reported to be involved in regulating somatic reprogramming (

14

). CECR2 has been reported to be involved in somatic reprogramming for the first time. Interestingly, CECR2 has been reported to form chromatin modification complex with SNF2L (

20

), suggesting that this complex may be involved in chromatin accessibility changes during Sall4-driven somatic reprogramming, thereby facilitating the somatic reprogramming process. It is important to note whether this CECR2-dependent SALL4-driven chromatin modification process is specific to somatic reprogramming or not. In addition, it is necessary to investigate whether there are similar mechanisms in the fate determination of other cells.

Experimental procedures

Cell culture

Male Oct4–GFP transgenic allele carrying mice (CBA/CaJ × C57BL/6J) were bred with 129Sv/Jae female mice to get OG2MEFs from 13.5 d.p.c mouse embryos. ODMEFs were isolated from 13.5 d.p.c mouse embryos from hybrids of Dppa5a-tdTomato reporter male mice (129) and OG2 female mice (CBA/CaJ × C57BL/6J). MEFs and PlatE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids(NEAA) and GlutaMAX supplement. mESCs were maintained on feeder layers with mES+2i medium (DMEM, 15% FBS, NEAA, GlutaMAX, β-Mercaptoethanol, PD0325901, Chir99021, LIF) or feeder free with N2B27+2i medium (knockout/DMEM, DMEM, N2, B27, NEAA, GlutaMAX, β-ME, PD0325901, Chir99021, LIF).

Generation of iPSCs

A total of 8 × 10

6

plat-E cells were seeded into 100-mm dish 1 day before transfection. Calcium phosphate transfection was performed when cell confluence reached 80%. Retrovirus supernatants were collected 48 and 72 h post transfection and filtered by 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). Retrovirus supernatants could be stored at room temperature for 24 h About 12 to 24 h before infection, MEFs were seeded into 12- or 24-well plate at a density of 5000 cells/cm

2

. Each retrovirus supernatant and MEFs culture medium were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with 4 g/ml polybrene to infect MEFs. After twice infection, MEFs were changed to iCD1 medium (

21

) and the day was defined as day 0. GFP+ colonies and td-Tomato+ colonies at different time points were counted to indicate reprogramming efficiency.

Generation of Cecr2 knockout OG2 mESCs

The Cecr2 knockout mESC line was generated by genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9. In brief, two pX330-puro vectors containing sgCecr2-1/2 were transfected into OG2 mESCs with lipo3000 in a ratio of 1:1. The colonies were selected by puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3 days. The sgRNA used for genome editing and PCR primers used for knockout identification were listed in

Table S1

.

Flow cytometry

Reprogramming cells were collected at different days and digested by 0.25% trypsin. Cells were suspended with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FBS). After being filtered, suspensions were analyzed with Fortessa cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Western blot

Western blots were performed using typical laboratory procedures with the antibodies anti-CECR2 (sc-514878, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-GAPDH (MAB374, Millipore).

Luciferase activity analysis

The pGL3-reporters were designed according to mESCs ATAC-seq and mESCs Sall4 ChIP-seq result. The analysis result indicated that Sall4 regulated Cecr2 at the TSS site. We constructed DNA sequences TSS ± 1kb and TSS-2kb into pGL3-Basic vector. 293T cells transfected with pMX-Sall4 were planted in 24-well plates at a density of 200,000 per well, and the pGL3-Basic vector (0.5 μg per well)/pGL3-reporter (500 ng per well, pGL3-TSS ± 1kb/pGL3-TSS-2kb) were co-transfected into the cells with TK-Renilla (5 ng per well) using Lipo3000 Transfection Reagent (L3000015, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in PLB (Promega), and the luciferase activity was detected according to the instructions for the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).

Coimmunoprecipitation

Plat-E cells were transfected with pMX-Cecr2-HA/pMX-Cecr2 ΔDDT-HA and pMX-Smarca1-3×FLAG at the same time. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were digested, counted, and lysed. One milliliter lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors) was used to lyse 1 × 10

7

cells. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged (13,000

g

for 10 min) and only the supernatant was collected. Immunoprecipitation was performed by 400 μl supernatant and 20 μl anti-HA beads (88837, Thermo Scientific) for 40 min at room temperature. Beads were washed with lysis buffer for five times and then boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10 min to resuspend sample. Antibodies used for coIP were anti-HA (3724s, CST); anti-FLAG (F1804, Sigma).

Immunoprecipitation-MS

Whole cell extracts of reprogramming cells at day 3 with Cecr2-FLAG/DsRed-FLAG overexpression (OKS+Cecr2-3×FLAG/OKS+DsRed-3×FLAG) were prepared using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40) with freshly added Complete Protease inhibitors (Sigma, 1187358001). Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Soluble cell lysates were collected by centrifugation (12,000

g

, 15 min at 4 °C). One milligram of cell lysates was incubated with either FLAG antibody or matched IgG overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Combined Protein A/G magnetic beads (Bio-Rad, 1614833) were added for another 1.5 h. Beads were then washed three times with wash cell lysis buffer and one time with PBS. After complete removal of PBS, immunoprecipitated proteins were digested using on-bead digestion protocol as described before (

22

). Briefly, beads were incubated with 100 μl of elution buffer (2 M urea, 10 mM DTT, and 100 mM Tris pH 8.5) for 20 min. Then, iodoacetamide (Sigma, I1149) was added to a final concentration of 50 mM for 10 min away from light, followed by 250 ng of trypsin (Promega, V5280) for partial digestion for 2 h. After incubation, the supernatant was collected in a separate tube. The beads were then incubated with 100 μl of elution buffer for another 5 min, and the supernatant was collected in the same tube. All these steps were performed at RT in a thermoshaker at 1500 rpm. Combined elutes were digested with 100 ng of trypsin overnight at RT. Finally, tryptic peptides were acidified to pH < 2 by adding 10 ml of 10% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid, Sigma, 1002641000) and desalted using C18 Stagetips (Sigma, 66883-U) prior to MS analyses.

Induction of embryoid bodies

in vitro

In order to induce embryoid bodies differentiation

in vitro

, mESCs were digested by 0.05% trypsin and cultured in suspension at a density of 1000 cells/20 μl. Suspension medium was mES medium (DMEM, 15% FBS). After 6 days of induction, embryoid bodies were collected and lysed with TRIzol to analyze germline genes expression. Germline genes include endoderm (Sall4, Sox17, Gata4, Gata6), mesoderm (Flk1, T), and ectoderm (Nestin, Sox1).

Generation of Cecr2 knockout MEFs

In order to get Cecr2 knockout MEFs, puromycin-resistant Cecr2 knockout OG2 mESCs were incubated with one or two E2.5 embryos to form chimeric or tetraploid embryos. In brief, E2.5 embryos were treated with acid Tyrode's solution to remove zona pellucida. Then one or two embryos was incubated with 15 to 20 Cecr2 knockout OG2 mESCs in incubator for 24 h to form blastocyst, followed by implantation into pseudopregnant ICR female mice. Chimeric MEFs were isolated from E13.5 embryos. Cecr2 knockout MEFs were selected by puromycin (2 μg/ml) for the following 3 days. All of the animal experiments were performed with the approval and according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health.

RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq

Total RNA was extracted with a TRIzol-based protocol and converted into cDNAs with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) and oligo-dT (Takara), and then analyzed by qPCR with Premix Ex Taq (Takara). Libraries were constructed according to the instructions for the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (RS-122-2001, Illumina). Sequencing was performed on a MiSeq instrument with Miseq Reagent Kit V2 (MS-102-2001, Illumina). Data were analyzed with RSEM software. The qPCR primers for pluripotent genes, Germline genes, and Cecr2 expression–related genes used in this research can be found in

Table S2

.

ATAC-seq

ATAC-seq was performed as previously described (

23

). In brief, 50,000 cells were collected and washed once with 50 ml cold PBS. Then 50 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl

2

, 0.2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630) was used to resuspend cells. The suspension was then centrifuged at 500

g

for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by addition of 50 ml transposition reaction mix (25 ml TD buffer, 2.5 ml Tn5 transposase, and 22.5 ml nuclease-free H

2

O) of Nextera DNA library Preparation Kit (96 samples) (FC-121-1031, Illumina). After suspension, samples were amplified by PCR and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was isolated using a MinElute Kit (QIAGEN). ATAC-seq libraries were subjected to five cycles of preamplification first to determine the number of cycles required for the second round of PCR. Then the amplified libraries, amplified by PCR for an appropriate number of cycles, were purified with a Qiaquick PCR (QIAGEN) column. The concentration of library was measured using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4824). Library integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis. Finally, the ATAC library was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 using a NextSeq 500 High Output Kit v2 (150 cycles) (FC-404-2002, Illumina).

ChIP-seq

Sall4 ChIP was performed with CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, Hyperactive pA-Tn5 Transposase for CUT&Tag, S603-01, Vazyme) method. In brief, 60,000 mESCs were collected and bounded to Concanavalin A–coated beads. Then cells were resuspended in antibody buffer and incubated with primary (SALL4A, abcam, ab29112) and secondary antibodies in order. Then samples were incubated with pA-Tn5 transposase. After transposon activation and tagmentation, DNA was isolated, amplified, and purified to construct ChIP-seq library. The ChIP DNA library for NextSeq 500 sequencing was constructed with VAHTS Turbo DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Vazyme Biotech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. AMPure XP beads were used for purification steps. The library was quantified with VAHTS Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Vazyme Biotech). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 v2 using 50-bp paired-end reads.

ATAC-seq analysis

All the sequencing data were mapped onto the mm10 mouse genome assembly using the bowtie2 software. Low-quality mapped reads were removed using samtools (view –q 35) and only unique reads mapping to a single genomic location or strand were kept. We removed mitochondrial sequences using ‘grep –v ‘chrM’. Biological replicates were merged, and peaks were called using dfilter (

) (with the settings: -bs = 100 –ks = 60 –refine). BigWig files were produced by genome Coverage Bed from bedtools (scale = 107/<each_sample’s_total_unique_reads >) and then bed graph to BigWig. Gene ontology and gene expression measures were first called by collecting all transcription start sites within 10 kb of an ATAC-seq peak and then performing GO analysis with goseq (

25

). Other analysis was performed using glbase (

26

).

RNA-seq, ChIP-seq analyses

RNA-seq clean reads were mapped to mouse transcript annotation of Gencode vM15 version on mm10 genome using RSEM (

27

). We chose

trans

per million value for the normalization and evaluation of gene expression levels. Meanwhile, ChIP-seq clean reads were mapped to mm10 genome using Bowtie2 package (

28

). Then we applied MACS2 (

29

) and Dfilter (

24

) to call the enriched peaks, then used Deeptools (

30

) and Homer (

31

) to calculate the ChIP-seq peak profiles near the gene. Data analysis and visualizations were performed in R environment.

#### SEZ6L - Article 1: The β-Secretase Substrate Seizure 6–Like Protein (SEZ6L) Controls Motor Functions in Mice

Introduction

The protease β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; also known as β-secretase) has fundamental functions in the nervous system, both under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. BACE1 is highly expressed in neurons and contributes to various physiological processes in the nervous system, including myelination, axon targeting and homeostasis of synapses [

1

,

2

]. BACE1 is also linked to pathophysiological processes, in particular to Alzheimer’s disease where it is a major drug target because it cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and catalyzes the first step in the generation of the amyloid β peptide, a key pathogenic agent in Alzheimer’s disease [

3

]. BACE1-targeted inhibitors have advanced to phase 3 trials for Alzheimer’s disease. However, several of them, unexpectedly, induced side effects, including mild cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms as well as an increased number of falls [

4

–

7

], pointing to potential defects in motor coordination. The molecular basis of the side effects is largely unknown, but they may result from too strongly inhibiting the cleavage of one or more of the numerous BACE1 substrates [

8

]. This issue needs to be resolved before clinical trials with BACE inhibitors are resumed. To date, the functions and consequences of BACE1 cleavage have only been studied for selected BACE1 substrates, such as type III neuregulin-1, Ig-containing β1 neuregulin, seizure protein 6 (SEZ6), close homolog of L1 (CHL1) and Aη, an APP-derived peptide [

9

–

16

].

For many other substrates and substrate candidates of BACE1, relatively little is known about their physiological function and how it may be altered through BACE1 cleavage. One of them is SEZ6-like (SEZ6L, also known as brain-specific receptor-like protein B (BSRP-B)), which forms a protein family with SEZ6 and SEZ6L2 that are also cleaved by BACE1 [

9

,

10

,

17

]. SEZ6L is broadly expressed in the murine brain, including in the neocortex and hippocampus as well as in the cerebellum [

10

,

17

,

18

], where SEZ6L is expressed in Purkinje and granule cells and in interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellum [

17

]. Given the strong expression of SEZ6L in the cerebellum, which contributes to motor coordination, SEZ6L may be involved in motor control in mice. In fact, mice lacking all three SEZ6 family members (SEZ6 triple knockout (KO) or TKO mice) have motor coordination deficits on the rotarod and cognitive deficits [

17

,

18

]. These phenotypes appear less pronounced or absent for the single knockout mice of the SEZ6 family [

17

], suggesting that the three SEZ6 family members may have partially redundant functions although detailed analyses of an independently generated SEZ6 single KO mouse line revealed specific defects in motor coordination and cognition [

19

]. SEZ6L single KO mice have not yet been investigated in depth.

Here, we provide a detailed behavioural analysis of SEZ6L KO mice. We report that SEZ6L deficiency does not lead to major changes in the anatomy or proteome of the cerebellum. The lack of SEZ6L does induce specific deficits in motor functions as well as altered stress-responsive behaviour, although memory functions are not affected.

Methods and Materials

Animal Procedures

Mice were group-housed in standard conditions in the animal facility of the University of Melbourne. All experimental procedures accorded with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne. Wild-type (WT), SEZ6L heterozygous (het) and SEZ6L knockout (KO) mice on a 129 × C57BL/6 background [

17

] were obtained from heterozygous matings. Additional WT and SEZ6L KO mice were housed in the pathogen-free animal facility of the Center for Stroke and Dementia Research (CSD) in Munich, Germany. Mouse work in the CSD was performed according to the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and was approved by the committee responsible for animal ethics of the government of Upper Bavaria (02-19-067).

Immunohistochemistry of the Cerebellum

We analysed 18-week-old SEZ6L KO and WT littermates (

n

=3). Animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a mixture of ketamine (400 mg/kg) and xylazine (27 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with cold 0.1 M PBS for 5 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS for 15 min. Brains were isolated and post-fixed for 24 h in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS and afterwards kept until cutting in 0.5% PFA in 0.1 M PBS. Half of a cerebellum was glued to the stage of a Microm HM 650V vibratome (Thermo Scientific) and cut submersed in Ringer buffer in 25-μm parasagittal sections. Sections were stored at 4°C in 0.1 M PBS until staining. Free-floating sections were permeabilized, blocked and stained in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X100 and 5% BSA (PBS-T) together with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000, goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 or donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488, Invitrogen) together with nuclear stain DAPI (0.2 μg/ml, Roth) for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Sections were washed as before, mounted in Mowiol (Fluka) onto glass slides (Engelbrecht, Edermünde, Germany). Stained sections were stored at 4°C until analysis. For each primary antibody, sections from all animals were stained and processed in parallel using the same reagents. Genotypes were hidden during staining and analysis.

Calbindin fluorescence intensity in Purkinje cell somata and dendrites was determined on calbindin (Cb38)-stained sections from z-stacks recorded using a ZEISS LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with Argon multiline and 405-nm diode lasers and a ×20, 0.8 (Fig.

1A, B

: GFAP) or x63, 1.4 (Fig

1B

: except GFAP) objective. Imaging parameters (except z-stack boundaries) were kept constant for a series of sections from all 6 animals stained with a given primary antibody. Comparisons between genotypes were performed within these series.

Measurements of mean intensity were calculated from the maximum intensity z-plane of circular ROIs within the apical part of five randomly selected Purkinje cell somata excluding nucleus and apical dendrites. For dendrites, measurements of mean intensity were calculated from the maximum intensity z-plane of rectangular ROIs within five randomly selected thick primary Purkinje cell dendrites. Quantification of Purkinje cell density was done on the upper or lower half of z-stacks selected for maximum intensity projection using the profile tool to measure the length of the PC layer. PC somata were counted manually.

Primary antibodies used: polyclonal rabbit anti-calbindin (Cb38, Swant), monoclonal SEZ6L (1:5; clone 21D9, IgG2a) [

10

], synaptophysin (1:100, mouse monoclonal, ab8049, Abcam), syntaxin 1B (1:500, rabbit polyclonal, Synaptic Systems), Pcp2 (1:4000, rabbit polyclonal, kind gift of Brad Denker), GFAP (1/4000, rabbit polyclonal, DAKO), IP3R (1:500, rabbit polyclonal, Alomone labs).

Proteomic Analysis

Cerebella from 5-month-old WT and SEZ6L KO (

n

=4) were collected and lysed in STET buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, supplemented with 1:500 Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) as described [

20

–

22

] using the Precellys soft tissue lysis kit (Precellys). The mix of sample and ceramic beads was homogenized in the Precellys Evolution homogenizer with the following settings: 6500 rpm, cycle: 2 × 30s, pause: 3s. After a subsequent 15 min incubation step at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 16,000

g

and 4 °C for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube.

Post-natal day 21 (P21) cerebella of the WT and SEZ6L KO (

n

=7) mice were collected and lysed in 1:1 ratio of high salt buffer (2M NaCl, 10 mM PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) and STET buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 2% TritonX-100) supplemented with 1:500 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Samples were processed using a tissue homogenizer (Omni International) at maximum speed for 60 s. Samples were incubated for 1h at 4 °C with occasional vortexing and afterwards centrifuged at 17,000

g

and 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube.

An amount of 25 units of Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 20 μg of protein and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C at 1400 rpm in the Thermomixer (Eppendorf) to remove remaining DNA. Afterwards, samples were digested with LysC and trypsin, using single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) [

23

]. Proteolytic peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in 20 μl 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.

Cerebella samples from 21 days were analysed using data-dependent acquisition. In total, 1.2 μg of peptides was separated on a nanoLC system (EASY-nLC 1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an in-house packed C18 column (30 cm × 75 μm ID, ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch GmbH) with a binary gradient of water and 80% acetonitrile (B) containing 0.1% formic acid (0 min, 3% B; 3.5 min, 6% B; 137.5 min, 30% B; 168.5 min, 44% B; 182.5 min,75% B; 185 min, 99% B, 200 min, 99% B) at 50 C column temperature. The nanoLC was coupled online via a nanospray flex ion source equipped with a column oven (Sonation) to a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Full MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and a

m/z

range from 300 to 1400. The top 15 peptide ions were chosen for collision-induced dissociation (resolution: 15,000, isolation width 1.6

m

/

z

, AGC target: 1E+5, NCE: 26%). A dynamic exclusion of 120 s was used for peptide fragmentation).

Samples from 5-month-old mice were analysed using data-independent acquisition. Full MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 (AGC target 5E+6). DIA fragmentation spectra were acquired by higher-energy collisional dissociation of all ions in 20 windows of variable size (resolution: 30,000, AGC target: 3E+6, stepped NCE 23.4%, 26%, 28.6%).

For spectral library generation, DDA measurements of mouse brain lysates (cerebellum and cerebrum) were performed. The raw data of DDA measurements were analysed with the Maxquant software (maxquant.org, Mack-Planck Institute Munich) [

24

] version 1.5.5.1.1.6.6.0. and searched against reviewed canonical FASTA database of Mus musculus (UniProt, 2018-07-23, 16,989 entries). Two missed trypsin cleavages were allowed. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modifications. For the main search peptide and peptide fragment, mass tolerances were set to 4.5 and 20 ppm, respectively. Label-free protein quantification was performed on the basis of at least 2 ratio counts of unique peptides per protein.

The software Spectronaut (12.0.20491.14.21367) [

25

] was used with a self-generated library on murine brain tissues (82 runs, 201,130 precursors, 7988 protein groups), using the default settings. Briefly, a 1% FDR was applied to peptide and protein identifications and LFQ was performed on the MS2 level. LFQ of proteins required at least one identified peptide and quantification was performed with up to three peptides.

Generated LFQ outputs were log2-transformed and an average log2-fold change was calculated for each protein, which was identified in at least 3 biological replicates per experimental group. Changes in protein abundance were evaluated using Student’s

t

-test between the log2 LFQ intensities of the two experimental groups. A permutation-based FDR estimation was used to account for multiple hypotheses (

p

=5%; s0=0.1) using the software Perseus [

26

,

27

].

Behavioural Testing

Male and female WT, SEZ6L het and SEZ6L KO mice aged between 4 and 6 months were used. Littermates were used and groups were age-matched. Experiments were performed in the light cycle and mice were acclimatised to the testing room, and equipment as appropriate, before behavioural testing. One cohort underwent multiple tests in a 2-month period, between 4 and 6 months of age, and tests were performed in the following order: inverted screen test, forelimb grip strength, ledged beam, DigiGait, locomotor cells, light/dark box and Morris water maze (only WT and SEZ6L KO underwent this final test). Mice tested in cohort one (excluding Morris water maze): 23–24 WT (9 male, 14–15 female), 30 SEZ6L het (15 male, 15 female) and 23 SEZ6L KO (15 male, 8 female). A number of additional mice were tested on the ledged beam and DigiGait; numbers are indicated in the relevant figure legend. Mice tested in

Morris water maze

: 22 WTs (9 male, 13 female) and 21 SEZ6L KOs (13 male, 8 female). A second cohort of mice aged 4–5 months was tested on the rotarod only: 29 WT (15 male, 14 female), 24 SEZ6L het (18 male, 16 female) and 36 SEZ6L KO (21 male, 15 female). A third cohort of mice aged 3–5 months was tested on the elevated open field: 30 WT (17 male, 13 female), 33 SEZ6L het (17 male, 16 female) and 29 SEZ6L KOs (15 male, 14 female). All training and testing sessions were performed by investigators blinded to the genotype of the mice. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inv.) as described below and in figure legends. Values represent mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Data from male and female mice were pooled in analyses where there was no statistical evidence of a sex difference.

Gait Analysis

Gait analysis was quantified with DigiGait imaging apparatus and software (Mouse Specifics Inc., Boston, MA). Mice were placed on a transparent treadmill within a 15 × 5 cm plexiglass compartment. Prior to the main study, a separate cohort of mice from the same colony was tested on a range of treadmill speeds and 25 cm/s was identified as a fast speed which allowed most mice to maintain a gait free from contact with the rear bumper or wall. A video camera mounted underneath the treadmill belt captured ventral images of the mice running at constant speeds of 15 cm/s and 25 cm/s and the videos (4 s long) were analysed with DigiGait software as previously described [

18

]. One male SEZ6L het was unable to run at a speed of either 15 or 25 cm/s for a sufficient length of time for analysis to be completed. Ten mice (3 male WT, 2 female WT, 1 male SEZ6L het, 2 male SEZ6L KOs and 2 female SEZ6L KOs) were unable to run for a sufficient length of time at 25 cm/s.

Rotarod

Motor coordination and learning were assessed by testing mice on an accelerating rotarod (IITC Life Science Inc.) with cylinders 1.25 inches in diameter. The rotarod speed gradually increased from 1 to 40 RPM over 5 min. Mice underwent 3 trials per day for 5 consecutive days with an intertrial interval of approximately 10 min. The latency to fall was recorded as the time the mouse fell off the cylinder or did one full passive rotation. If a mouse remained on the cylinder at the end of the trial, the latency was recorded as 300 s.

Assessment of Muscle Strength

Forelimb grip strength was recorded on a mouse grip strength meter (Ametek, USA). Mice were lifted by the tail, allowed to grasp the triangular pull bar with both forepaws and were gently pulled backwards in the horizontal plane until their forepaws released the bar. The peak tension (in kg) was recorded for five successful tests performed 30 s apart. The highest value from the five trials was recorded as the grip strength for that mouse and was normalised to its body weight. In the inverted screen test, mice were placed on a 20cm × 20 cm grid screen composed of 1cm × 1cm squares of 1mm diameter wire. The screen was held 40 cm above an enclosed area containing cushioning and after ~5 s was slowly inverted so the mice were hanging upside down with all four paws gripping the screen. The time until the mouse fell off the screen was recorded as the ‘hang time’. After a maximum of 600 s, any mice still gripping the screen were removed.

Ledged Beam

Locomotor precision was assessed with the ledge beam. Mice were placed onto an 80-cm-long black Perspex beam that was 3.5cm wide at the starting end and progressively narrowed to 1mm. One centimeter below the beam was a 0.5cm wide clear plastic ledge that the mice could use to recover if their feet slipped off the beam. Mice performed 2 days of training with 3 traversals per day prior to testing. On the test day, mice traversed the beam once while being recorded. Videos of the left and right sides were analysed for forepaw and hindpaw foot faults, total number of steps (hindpaw placements) and total time to traverse the beam (s).

Locomotor Cells

Mice were individually placed in activity test chambers (Med Associates Inc.) measuring 27.5 × 27.5 cm × 20.5 cm (height) for 30 min under ambient lighting. Locomotor activity was recorded for 30 min and analysed in the horizontal and vertical planes.

Light/Dark Box

Anxiety-like behaviour was investigated with the light/dark box test. Mice were individually placed in activity test chambers as described above with a black plastic insert that created a dark area in one half of the chamber (27.5 cm × 13.5 cm) with an opening for the mouse to move between light and dark areas. The ‘light’ part of the chamber was illuminated to 750 lux. Mice were placed in the dark area and the locomotor activity in the light and dark areas was recorded for 10 min.

Elevated Open Field

Anxiety-like behaviour in an aversive environment was assessed with the elevated open field as previously described [

28

]. Mice were placed on the test arena (75 × 100cm) without walls situated 60cm above the ground. Overhead lighting was switched off and two spotlights (3000 lux) on either side of the arena shone directly onto the field to create an aversive environment. Mice were placed in the centre of the field and allowed to explore freely for 3 min. Videos were obtained using TopScan Lite (CleverSys Inc.). Time moved and latency to leave the centre were recorded by the experimenter.

Morris Water Maze

Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze. A pool measuring 1.4 m in diameter was surrounded by spatial cues. The water depth was 30 cm with non-toxic white paint added to make the water opaque. The ‘hidden’ platform (15 cm diameter) was submerged 1 cm below the water level. In the acquisition phase, mice were placed in a given quadrant and given up to 2 min to find the platform; after this time, the mouse was gently guided to the platform. Mice spent 10 s on the platform before they were removed, had excess water gently blotted off and were placed in a cage under a warming lamp to dry. Mice had four acquisition sessions within a 1-h period at approximately the same time each day for 6 days. During the acquisition phase, the starting coordinate (north/east/west/south) changed with each session on a given day and the order of starting coordinates changed daily; the location of the hidden platform (NE quadrant) remained the same. In the probe trial on day 7, mice were placed in the SW quadrant and the platform was removed; mice were left in the pool for 1 min and the amount of time spent in/distance travelled in/entries into the target NE quadrant was observed. Cognitive flexibility was examined by altering the platform location. The reversal phase was conducted in the same way as the acquisition phase with the location of the hidden platform moved (to the SW quadrant). Mice had four reversal sessions within a 1-h period at the same time each day for 4 days. In the reversal probe trial on day 12, mice were placed in the NE quadrant and the platform was removed; mice were left in the pool for 1 min and the amount of time spent in/distance travelled in/entries into the target SW quadrant was observed. Behavioural parameters were analysed with CleverSys Topscan tracking software.

Results

SEZ6L Deficiency Does Not Alter Cerebellar Anatomy and Proteome

SEZ6L-deficient (SEZ6L KO) mice were generated as described [

17

]. SEZ6L het and KO mice were viable and had no obvious health issues. Within sex, there was no significant effect of genotype on body weight in 4-month-old male mice (WT 30.2 ± 1.3 g, SEZ6L het 30.3 ± 0.7 g, SEZ6L KO 31.3 ± 0.9 g; 1-way ANOVA

p

>0.05,

n

=13–16/genotype); however, 4-month-old female SEZ6L het and SEZ6L KO mice were slightly heavier than female WTs (WT 21.2 ± 0.5 g, SEZ6L het 24.4 ± 0.7 g, SEZ6L KO 23.4 ± 0.7 g; 1-way ANOVA

p

=0.0030,

n

=15–16/genotype).

Because SEZ6L is highly expressed in the cerebellum [

17

,

18

], we used immunohistochemistry and proteomics to determine whether SEZ6L deficiency induces major changes in cerebellar anatomy or the cerebellar proteome. Sections from wild-type and SEZ6L KO mice at 4 months of age were stained for (a) calbindin, (b) Purkinje cell–specific protein 2 (pcp2), which serve as markers of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC), (c) for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, which is highly expressed in PCs, (d) for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a marker for astrocytes and (e) for the neuronal protein synaptophysin (Fig.

1A, B

). As a control, SEZ6L staining was seen in wild-type, but not in SEZ6L KO cerebellum (Fig.

1B

). The intensity of the calbindin staining was not different between the genotypes, in either the PC dendrites or in the soma (Fig.

1A

). Likewise, the density of PCs within the cerebellum was not changed (Fig.

1A

). Similarly, staining for Pcp2, IP3, GFAP and synaptophysin did not reveal obvious differences between wild-type and SEZ6L KO mice. Thus, we conclude that SEZ6L deficiency does not induce major neuroanatomical changes in the cerebellum.

Staining intensity in PC dendrites and soma as well as PC density is not significantly different between the genotype in 3 biological replicates. Data displayed as mean ± SEM. a.u.: arbitrary units. (B) SEZ6L KO cerebellar sections did not show any difference in synaptic marker staining (synaptophysin), PC morphology (as stained with Pcp2), structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (as indicated by IP3R staining) nor in the glial marker GFAP. SEZ6L antibody was used as a control. White arrows represent Purkinje cells. Scale bar: 20 μm

Next, we used quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry–based proteomics to compare the proteome of the cerebellum from 5-month-old wild-type and SEZ6L KO mice (Supp. Table

1

). Total cerebellar protein extracts of four biological replicates of each genotype were analysed. Protein abundance differences between SEZ6L KO mice and wild-type mice are displayed in a volcano plot (Fig.

2

). Proteins with reduced abundance in the SEZ6L KO cerebellum are on the left side of the y-axis, whereas proteins with an increased abundance are on the right side of the y-axis. Proteins indicated with a circle in red have a

p

-value of less than 0.05. The hyperbolic curves correct for multiple hypothesis testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) approach. While numerous proteins appeared to have reduced or increased levels in the SEZ6L KO cerebellum, none of the proteins remained statistically significant after FDR correction (Fig.

2

). Similar results were obtained from young mice at post-natal day 21 (P21) (Suppl. Fig.

1

). We thus conclude that loss of SEZ6L does not induce major changes of the murine cerebellar proteome.

SEZ6L KO Mice Exhibit Gait Differences as Assessed by Treadmill Walking

SEZ6 TKO mice lacking SEZ6, SEZ6L and SEZ6L2 have a distinct motor phenotype [

17

,

18

]. Although we found that SEZ6L deficiency did not lead to major anatomical or proteomic changes in the cerebellum, it is important to note that the cerebellum is only one of several anatomical structures involved in motor control. Thus, a detailed behavioural analysis of SEZ6L KO mice is required to test for the involvement of SEZ6L in motor control. To assess the role of SEZ6L in normal movement parameters, we employed the DigiGait system which is widely used to analyse gait in genetically altered mice. Experimental mice were first tested at a treadmill speed of 15 cm/s and then at 25 cm/s, and, for most DigiGait indices, average forelimb/paw and average hindlimb/paw values for each mouse were used for analysis. Animal body width did not vary significantly between genotypes or sexes (average of DigiGait measurements taken at 15 and 25 cm/s; 2-way ANOVA with genotype and sex as factors). There was a significant effect of sex, but not genotype, on animal length from nose to base of the tail (2-way ANOVA,

p

= 0.0044) with males slightly longer than females (13.3 ± 0.136 vs. 12.7 ± 0.168 cm). In order to identify gait parameters that exhibit sex-specific changes, major DigiGait indices were analysed with a 2-way ANOVA with genotype and sex as factors (Supp. Table

2)

. Where no sex difference was observed, data from male and female mice were pooled.

SEZ6L KO mice exhibited a number of gait differences to WT mice, and in some cases to SEZ6L het mice, at treadmill speeds of 25 cm/s (Table

1

) and 15 cm/s (Supp. Table

3

). On a treadmill speed of 25 cm/s, SEZ6L KO mice exhibited increased stride length (~13% higher in KO compared to WT), increased time to complete a stride (~11% higher) and consequently a decrease in stride frequency (steps per second; ~11% lower). While data from male and female mice were pooled for this analysis, this change in gait was comparable in male and female SEZ6L KO mice when sexes were analysed separately (e.g. hindlimb stride length in male WT vs. KO = 6.22 ± 0.246 vs. 6.78 ± 0.175; hindlimb stride length in female WT vs. KO = 5.73 ± 0.264 vs. 6.60 ± 0.292). At the slower speed of 15 cm/s, changes to stride time and frequency were similarly altered in SEZ6L KO compared to WT mice and stride length was significantly increased in SEZ6L KO compared to het mice when examining hindlimbs. Stride time is a combination of stance duration (paw contact with treadmill) and swing time (no paw contact); both of these indices were increased in some SEZ6L KO categories at both treadmill speeds. Stance time can be further divided into brake duration (initial to maximal paw contact) and the propulsion phase. These indices were not significantly different between genotypes at 25 cm/s apart from an increase in propulsion time of the hindlimbs between male SEZ6L KO and het mice. At 15 cm/s, brake duration was increased in SEZ6L KOs compared to WT (forelimb) and in SEZ6L hets compared to WT (hindlimb). There was no difference in stance width between genotypes, indicating no deficit in stability in SEZ6L KOs. Overall, the gait of SEZ6L KO mice primarily differs from WTs in stride length and frequency: SEZ6L KO mice take longer and less frequent strides than WT mice to maintain the treadmill pace.

SEZ6L KO Mice Show Motor Coordination Deficits on the Accelerating Rotarod

On the accelerating rotarod (1–40 RPM, 3 trials/day over 5 days), SEZ6L KO females did not exhibit the same degree of motor improvement as WT and SEZ6L het female mice over the course of the experiment, having a shorter latency to fall. In the female cohort, there were significant effects of genotype (

p

= 0.0001), trial (

p

< 0.0001) and interaction between factors (

p

=0.0001; 2-way repeated measured ANOVA). Tukey’s multiple comparisons test indicated differences between WT and SEZ6L KO females on trials 7 and trials 10–15. Similarly, SEZ6L KO females had a shorter latency to fall than SEZ6L het females during trials 4–15. No significant differences were seen between SEZ6L het and WT females (Fig.

3A

). Compared to the striking deficit of female SEZ6L KO mice on the rotarod, differences between male genotypes were minimal. In the male cohort, there were no significant effects of genotype (

p

= 0.0722); however, there were significant effects of trial (

p

< 0.0001) and interaction between factors (

p

= 0.0156; 2-way repeated measured ANOVA). Tukey’s multiple comparisons test indicated no differences between WT and SEZ6L KO males in individual trials. There were differences between SEZ6L het and KO males from trials 9 to 11 and 13 to 14 and between SEZ6L het and WT males at trial 14; in these trials, SEZ6L het males remained on the rotarod for a longer period of time (Fig.

3B

). In summary, SEZ6L KO mice displayed deficits in motor coordination and learning on the accelerating rotarod in a sex-specific manner.

SEZ6L KO mice show motor coordination deficits on the accelerating rotarod. On the accelerating rotarod (1–40 rpm, 3 trials/day over 5 days), female SEZ6L KO mice performed significantly worse than both WT and SEZ6L het mice (A). In contrast, male SEZ6L KO and WT mice performed similarly, although differences were seen between SEZ6L het and KO mice in later trials and between SEZ6L het and WT mice in trial 14 (B).

SEZ6L KO Mice Exhibit Normal Spontaneous Movement, Locomotor Precision and Muscular Strength

SEZ6L KO, het and WT mice exhibited similar levels of spontaneous movement in locomotor cells, as assessed by their ambulatory time (Fig.

4A

) and distance (Fig.

4B

) over either 5 or 30 min (5-min data not shown). SEZ6L KO mice did not display deficits in locomotor precision on the ledged beam, an apparatus that becomes progressively narrower in length. No difference was observed between SEZ6L KO, het and WT mice in forepaw or hindpaw errors per step (Supp. Fig.

2Ai-ii

) and all genotypes had a similar beam traversal time (not shown). Additionally, there was no difference between genotypes in the total number of steps taken to traverse the ledged beam (not shown). There was no difference between SEZ6L KO, het and WT mice in the peak strength (units) relative to body mass as determined by the forelimb grip strength test (Supp. Fig.

2B

) and no difference between genotypes in hang time on the inverted screen test (Supp. Fig.

2C

), indicating normal muscular strength.

Fig. 4

SEZ6L KO mice exhibit normal spontaneous locomotion and increased anxiety-like behaviour. WT, SEZ6L het and SEZ6L KO mice behave similarly in locomotor cells (Ai-ii: 1-way ANOVA within sex). Mice tested: 23 WTs (9 male, 14 female), 30 SEZ6L hets (15 male, 15 female) and 23 SEZ6L KOs (15 male, 8 female). In the elevated open field, the time spent moving was approximately halved in SEZ6L KO compared to WT mice. The time spent moving by SEZ6L hets was part way between the WT and SEZ6L KO groups (Bi). SEZ6L KO mice took longer to leave the centre of the field at the beginning of the test compared to WT mice (Bii). WT

SEZ6L KO Mice Exhibit Enhanced Anxiety-Like Behaviour

SEZ6 TKO mice lacking SEZ6L and related family members showed increased stress responsiveness on the elevated open field and deficits in spatial memory [

18

]; therefore, SEZ6L KO mice underwent these behavioural analyses. A cohort of naïve mice was tested on the elevated open field, an aversive environment with no walls and bright lights which elicits anxiety-like behaviour in mice [

18

,

28

]. A clear difference was seen in exploratory behaviour across genotypes; the time spent moving by SEZ6L KO mice in this 3-min test was approximately half the time spent moving by WTs, and SEZ6L het mice displayed a level of movement part way between the SEZ6L KO and WT groups (Fig.

4Bi

; 1-way ANOVA. Tukey’s multiple comparisons test: KO vs. WT,

p

< 0.0001; KO vs. het,

p

p

< 0.0001. KO = 33.4 ± 3.2 s, het = 50.3 ± 2.6 s, WT = 69.7 ± 2.4 s). SEZ6L KO mice took significantly longer to leave the centre of the field at the beginning of the test compared to WT mice (Fig.

4Bii

; non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA. SEZ6L KO vs. WT,

p

= 0.0355, 29.8 ± 4.9 s vs. 14.9 ± 2.0 s). In contrast, similar levels of anxiety were displayed by WT, SEZ6L het and SEZ6L KO mice as measured by their behaviour in the less aversive light-dark box test (Figure

4C

). There was no difference between genotypes in the time spent in the light area (as % duration of total time, Fig.

4Ci

) at either 5 or 10 min (5-min data not shown) and no difference between genotypes in the distance moved in the light area (as % duration of total distance, Fig.

4Cii

) at either 5 or 10 min (5-min data not shown). In contrast to their behaviour in the locomotor cells, there was a slight decrease in the overall level of movement exhibited by SEZ6L KO compared to SEZ6L het mice when looking at the total time spent moving and total distance moved in the whole apparatus (10-min timepoint; time (s): WT 52.3 ± 3.63, SEZ6L het 60.1 ± 2.59, SEZ6L KO 44.4 ± 4.39,

p

= 0.0073; distance (mm): WT 1617 ± 107, SEZ6L het 1834 ± 68.8, SEZ6L KO 1358 ± 140,

p

= 0.0062, 1-way ANOVA with sex pooled). In summary, the behaviour in the aversive environment of the elevated open field indicates altered stress responsiveness in both SEZ6L KO and het mice compared to WT.

SEZ6L KO Mice Perform Normally in a Test of Spatial Learning and Memory

In the Morris water maze, a test of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility, WT and SEZ6L KO mice performed similarly (het mice were not tested). In both the acquisition (days 1–6) and reversal (day 8–11) phases, there was a significant effect of day (

p

< 0.0001) but no effect of genotype or interaction of factors (

p

> 0.05, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA) when looking at the amount of time taken to find the hidden platform (Fig.

5A

). There was also no effect of genotype on the path length distance taken to find the platform (data not shown) and no difference between genotypes in swimming velocity (mm/s, data not shown), indicating that the gait differences seen in SEZ6L KO mice do not affect their swimming speed. WT and SEZ6L KO mice both spent an increased percentage of time in the target quadrant in both the acquisition and reversal probe trials (as determined by 95% confidence interval of the mean time not overlapping with chance; Fig.

5B

), demonstrating that both genotypes learnt the task initially and when the platform position was altered. These results suggest that constitutive SEZ6L deletion does not result in spatial learning and memory deficits.

WT and SEZ6L KO mice perform similarly in acquisition and reversal phases of the Morris water maze in both the time taken to learn the location of the hidden platform (A, data analysed with repeated measures 2-way ANOVA and displayed as mean ± SEM) and in the proportion of time spent in the target quadrant during probe trials (B, displayed as mean with 95% confidence interval; chance level indicated by dotted line).

Comparison of SEZ6L KO and SEZ6 TKO Phenotypes

SEZ6 TKO mice lacking SEZ6, SEZ6L and SEZ6L2 display motor and cognitive deficits [

. Similar but less pronounced motor deficits have now been identified in SEZ6L KO mice, while results from the elevated open field are comparable in SEZ6L KO and SEZ6 TKO mice. SEZ6L KO mice did not display the reversal learning deficits in the Morris water maze seen in SEZ6 TKOs (Table

).

Discussion

Our study reports new functions for SEZ6L in the nervous system. We establish SEZ6L as a gene essential for normal motor coordination and important for controlling body movements. We further demonstrate that the lack of SEZ6L is associated with anxiety-related behaviour, indicating that SEZ6L loss of function may contribute to aspects of neuropsychiatric diseases.

Among members of the SEZ6 family, substantial knowledge has been gained about SEZ6, which has a fundamental role in the nervous system, e.g. in synaptic connectivity, motor coordination, synaptic transmission through kainate receptors and long-term potentiation, a cellular correlate of learning and memory [

19

,

29

,

30

]. Altered SEZ6 levels in cerebrospinal fluid are also linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease [

31

,

32

]. Compared to SEZ6, much less is known about SEZ6L. While the expression of SEZ6 is largely restricted to neurons [

19

], SEZ6L is expressed more widely, both within and outside of the brain, including in the pancreas [

10

,

17

,

18

,

33

]. Variants of the SEZ6L gene are linked to distinct neuropsychiatric diseases, such as bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders [

34

,

35

]

,

and also to cancer (e.g. [

36

]). To date, little is known about how changes in SEZ6L contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. At the molecular level, SEZ6L is a complement regulator, raising the possibility that SEZ6L is involved in complement-dependent synaptic pruning during central nervous system development [

37

].

Our study now establishes a major function for SEZ6L in controlling motor coordination in mice. The changes in gait observed in SEZ6L KOs, namely the longer and less frequent strides, were also observed in SEZ6 TKO mice, lacking all three SEZ6 family members [

18

], which have additional motor deficits (Table

2

). This suggests that the gait abnormalities seen in SEZ6 TKO mice may be primarily due to the loss of SEZ6L, although whether a single knockout of SEZ6 or SEZ6L2 results in a similar gait phenotype has not been examined. Expression of SEZ6L is high in multiple areas of the developing and adult brain that are important for motor function and the mechanisms underlying the altered gait in SEZ6L KO mice are yet to be determined. While we observed no changes in the proteome of the cerebellum in SEZ6L KO mice, future proteomic studies should assess other motor areas expressing SEZ6L, such as the motor cortex, or examine cerebellar changes in a more sensitive way, for example by micro-dissecting the deep cerebellar nuclei. The gait differences observed between SEZ6L KO and WT mice were similar in males and females; likewise, the gait phenotype in SEZ6 TKO mice was not sex-specific [

18

]. In contrast, a sex-specific SEZ6L KO phenotype was seen on the rotarod: female SEZ6L KO mice had a significant deficit compared to female SEZ6L het/WT mice but males of all genotypes performed similarly. It should be noted that the improvement of male mice over the course of the experiment was relatively poor which raises the possibility that the rotarod parameters, while appropriate for the female cohort, may have been too challenging for the males and, therefore, less suitable for detecting differences between genotypes in the male cohort. SEZ6L het and KO female mice were slightly heavier than WTs; however, this did not negatively influence the performance of female SEZ6L hets and is thus unlikely to account for the impaired motor coordination seen in female SEZ6L KOs. Like SEZ6L KOs, SEZ6 KO mice show deficits on the rotarod [

19

]. The more pronounced motor coordination impairments seen in (male) SEZ6 TKO mice tested on the rotarod [

18

], compared to single KOs, supports the idea of SEZ6 family members being functionally redundant as previously suggested [

17

]. Future experiments should determine whether motor deficits are similar in young and aged SEZ6L KOs as some motor deficits in SEZ6 TKO mice become more pronounced with age [

18

].

Overall, the motor phenotype of SEZ6L KO mice is similar to, but more subtle than, the phenotype of SEZ6 TKO mice. In contrast, results from the elevated open field are comparable in SEZ6L KO and SEZ6 TKO mice (Table

2

), suggesting that SEZ6L deletion is contributing to the anxiety-like phenotype previously reported in SEZ6 TKO mice (which was also manifest in the zero maze, not examined in this study) [

18

]. Deletion of a single SEZ6L allele was sufficient to produce a clear change in locomotor behaviour on the elevated open field. Like SEZ6 TKO mice, SEZ6L KOs and hets showed a substantially lower level of movement and an increased latency to leave the start zone, indicating a reluctance to explore the stressful environment. Future studies should further investigate the role of SEZ6L in anxiety-related behaviour and identify whether SEZ6L KO mice have enhanced fear learning, as identified in SEZ6 TKOs [

18

]. Additionally, examination of a conditional SEZ6L KO, in which SEZ6L expression is deleted in adulthood, would reveal which cognitive and motor phenotypes are related to the absence of SEZ6L in the mature central nervous system.

SEZ6L is a single-span transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain (ectodomain) containing three CUB (complement subcomponent C1r, C1s/sea urchin embryonic growth factor Uegf/bone morphogenetic protein 1) and five Sushi domains (also referred to as complement control protein or short consensus repeat (SCR)), followed by a transmembrane and a short intracellular domain. CUB and Sushi domains are features of proteins engaging in protein-protein interactions [

40

–

43

]. Moreover, SEZ6L is found at the surface of neurons [

10

,

44

], suggesting that it may act as a surface receptor or ligand; however, the binding partners of SEZ6L are not yet known. SEZ6L has been shown to be a substrate of the transmembrane protease BACE1, which cleaves numerous membrane proteins in the nervous system [

9

,

15

,

16

,

22

,

33

,

45

–

49

]. As a result of BACE1 cleavage, the large SEZ6L ectodomain is secreted into the conditioned medium of cultured cells or into body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. This proteolytic process is referred to as ectodomain shedding and is a fundamental mechanism to control the function and abundance of surface membrane proteins [

50

]. Likewise, BACE1 cleavage controls the surface abundance of SEZ6L in primary neurons [

10

] but it remains to be seen whether this cleavage event also affects the function of SEZ6L, e.g. in motor coordination. Future experiments should examine the effect of BACE inhibitor treatment of SEZ6L KO mice or assess a BACE1-resistant SEZ6L knockin model. Nevertheless, BACE1-deficient mice also show deficits in motor coordination, linked to the reduced cleavage of another BACE1 substrate, the Ig-containing β1 neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). BACE1 cleavage of Nrg1 is required for motor coordination through the formation and maintenance of muscle spindles [

11

]. Potential motor deficits were also seen in Alzheimer patients and elderly individuals with high risk for Alzheimer’s disease that were treated in phase 3 studies with a BACE1 inhibitor [

4

,

5

]. The treated individuals showed a small but significant increase in the number of falls, consistent with the motor deficits seen in BACE1-deficient mice. Whether the loss of BACE1-shed SEZ6L ectodomain also contributes to the motor deficits in BACE1-deficient mice, or in BACE1 inhibitor-treated individuals, remains to be determined.

Taken together, the results of our study establish a physiological function for SEZ6L in motor coordination and a pathological contribution of the lack of SEZ6L to anxiety-related behaviour, implicating aberrant SEZ6L function in movement disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disorder [

1

,

2

]. So far, no disease modifying therapies against AD are available. Only symptomatic treatment options are approved. Currently, about 30 million patients are suffering from AD worldwide. Due to an ageing population, it is estimated that by the year 2050 numbers will increase to 106 million AD patients [

1

,

2

]. These numbers raise the concern of AD becoming an epidemic problem. The β-secretase, known as

β

-site

a

myloid precursor protein

c

leaving

e

nzyme 1 (BACE1), plays a central role in AD pathogenesis as it initiates the production of (toxic) amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) that accumulate in AD brains [

3

]. BACE1 has become a prime therapeutic target for lowering Aβ and thus, treating AD, and clinical development of BACE1 inhibitors is being intensely pursued [

4

].

It has been shown that AD shares several key features with the rare, inherited, still untreatable, neurodegenerative disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) [

5

,

6

]. Common features include accumulation of intracellular Aβ and APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, neurodegeneration, activation of astrocytes and microglia, and altered cholesterol metabolism. In contrast to AD, which is a complex disorder involving both genetic and environmental components, NPC is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either

NPC1

or

NPC2

gene [

7

,

8

,

9

]. Both code for proteins involved in cholesterol transport. NPC can represent an innovative model in which a defect of a single gene could be used to dissect certain molecular aspects of complex AD. Due to similarities between NPC and AD, NPC disease has also been termed “juvenile Alzheimer’s disease”. However, these two neurodegenerative disorders also show clear distinctions. In contrast to AD, where neurodegeneration primarily occurs in hippocampus and cortex, while cerebellum seems to be protected, in NPC disease Purkinje cells in the cerebellum are the most affected cell types in the brain, while the hippocampus seems to be spared. Different vulnerabilities of brain regions (hippocampus vs. cerebellum) between these two neurodegenerative disorders may give us important clues about protective and/or vulnerable mechanism(s) of neurodegeneration and may also identify critical components in this process. Therefore, further studies of similarities and differences between AD and NPC are encouraged to increase our understanding of the molecular events taking place during the pathogenesis of these conditions, as well as our chances of finding disease-modifying therapies. In AD, for example, the pharmacological inhibition of β-secretase is one of the most promising therapeutic approaches which has entered clinical trial phase II/III [

4

]. However, recent discovery of multiple BACE1 substrates has raised the concern on potential side-effects that may occur upon BACE1-inhibition [

10

]. Indeed, prolonged inhibition of BACE1 has shown to impair synaptic plasticity [

11

,

12

]. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the function and the effect of cleavage of BACE1 substrates to better evaluate therapeutic potential of BACE1 and foresee the side-effects of BACE1-inhibition.

We have previously reported that increased levels of Aβ and soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) fragments in NPC1-null cells are due to enhanced BACE1 processing of APP [

13

] which most likely involves cholesterol-mediated sequestration of both APP and BACE1 within the endocytic compartments [

14

] and/or within lipid rafts [

15

]. In line with the recent identification of additional BACE1 substrates [

10

,

16

,

17

], in this study, we tested whether enhanced BACE1-dependent proteolysis occurs in NPC1

(NPC1) mouse brains and whether it is specific for APP or could also be observed for other BACE1 substrates that could be of relevance for disease pathology. Namely, we analysed processing and localization of seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L) in NPC1 vs. wt mouse brains (cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) at 4-weeks of age, to detect the earliest BACE1-mediated changes associated with the disease, and at 10-weeks of age to identify changes at the end-stage of disease. Sez6 and Sez6L were selected as being top BACE1 substrates [

18

] and nearly exclusively cleaved by BACE1 in neurons [

10

,

19

] and not—like APP—additionally by an α-secretase [

18

,

20

]. Although the function of Sez6/Sez6L proteins is unknown, both proteins may be involved in synaptic (dys)function [

21

,

22

]–characteristic features of both AD and NPC diseases. In addition, these proteins were analysed due to the fact that patients with NPC disease exhibit seizures together with the loss of motor control, dementia and other neuropathological symptoms [

9

,

23

]. We hypothesized that, upon NPC1-dysfunction, cholesterol-mediated sequestration of BACE1 within the endolysosomal system (where BACE1 is most active) causes enhanced cleavage of BACE1-substrates, and that increased BACE1-mediated proteolysis may also contribute to the pathological features of NPC disease.

Materials and methods

NPC1 mouse model

A mouse model of NPC disease, the BALB/cNctr-

Npc1

m1N

/J (stock number 003092), were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA, and were housed at the JSW Lifesciences GmbH / QPS Austria GmbH animal facility in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. Mice were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with access to water and a standard mouse diet

ad libitum

. Female and male NPC1

+/-

mice were mated to generate NPC1

-/-

(NPC1) and NPC1

+/+

(wt, control) mice as NPC1

-/-

(NPC1) mice are not fertile. Mice were genotyped according to already published protocols (

http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/003092.html

). Mouse genotype was further confirmed by using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)/Western blotting, and immunoblotting with an anti-NPC1 antibody (ab134113; Abcam). All the experiments on these mice were approved by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia and by the Bioethics Committee of the Ruder Boskovic Institute.

All mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (Isoba, Essex). Afterwards, mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution. Brains were removed and hemisected; left hemispheres were immediately cut into cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex and remaining brain and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, whereas right hemispheres were immersion fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for one hour and then transferred to a 15% sucrose solution for 24 hours to ensure cryoprotection. On the next day, hemispheres were frozen in liquid isopentane and stored at -80°C until cutting.

Antibodies

N-terminal antibody against seizure protein 6 (Sez6) was described previously [

10

,

21

]. For detection of seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L) we used monoclonal antibody 21D9 [

19

]. Additionally, immunoblotting of mouse brain tissue lysates was performed using the following antibodies: anti-BACE1 (D10E5; Cell Signaling); anti-APP (22C11; Merck Millipore) for flAPP and sAPPt; anti-sAPPβ (SIG39138; Covance) and anti-actin (Sigma Aldrich). For immunohistochemistry of mouse brain tissue, the following antibodies were used: anti-BACE1 (Epitomics; Abcam), anti-APP (Y188; Epitomics, Abcam), anti-GFAP (Dako), anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences) and anti-calbindin (Swant). Immunocytochemistry of primary mouse cortical neurons was performed using these antibodies: anti-BACE1 (Epitomics; Abcam), anti-EEA1 (Cell Signaling), anti-transferrin receptor (TfR; ThermoFisher Scientific) and anti-LAMP1 (1D4B, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Preparation of mouse brain tissue lysates and immunoblotting

Preparation of mouse brain tissue lysates for analysing BACE1 proteolysis of its substrates was performed as in Kuhn et al. [

10

]. Dissected tissues from NPC1

+/+

(wt) and NPC1

-/-

(NPC1) mice were weighed and ten-fold volume to weight ratio of homogenization buffer was added for homogenization of each tissue sample, as follows: to generate soluble fractions, tissues were homogenized in 0.25% DEA, 100mM NaCl buffer, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science), in a glass homogenizer until tissue lysate appeared uniform. The centrifugation was carried out at 100 000 × g at 4°C for 30 minutes. After the centrifugation, tissue supernatants were collected, placed in fresh tubes and stored at -80°C freezer until further use. To generate membrane-bound fractions, the obtained tissue pellets were further homogenized in the same volume of 1% Triton buffer [1% Triton X-100, 150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 2mM EDTA]—containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science) by using a glass homogenizer. The lysates were then pressed through a 23-gauge needle by using a 1 ml syringe until tissue lysates appeared uniform. These tissue lysates were left on ice for 30 minute incubation. Following this step, the lysates were centrifuged at 100 000 × g at 4°C for 30 minutes. After the centrifugation, tissue supernatants were collected, placed in fresh tubes and stored at -80°C freezer until further use. Proteins of interest were detected using SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, under reducing and non-reducing conditions (for Sez6L) on Tris-Glycine gels, followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies.

Analyses of protein levels in mouse brain tissue lysates

For analyses of different proteins, six NPC1

+/+

(wt) and six NPC1

-/-

(NPC1) mice (mixed-sex) were used at both 4- and 10-weeks of age. For analyses of proteins in specific brain regions, all mouse brain protein lysates were separated by using one 15-well SDS-PAGE gel. In addition, a protein standard, represented by either one mouse brain-DEA- or one mouse brain-1% Triton-buffer lysate, was loaded in the end two lanes of every gel, to allow comparison of results between gels and experiments. Protein signals were quantified by using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA). Signal values obtained for all proteins of interest were divided with an average signal value of the corresponding protein standards loaded on each gel. Then, each protein signal was normalized against actin values (either “Actin-DEA” for DEA lysates or “Actin-Triton” for 1% Triton buffer lysates) to correct for protein content. Comparison of protein levels between two groups of data (wt- vs. NPC1-mice) was performed by using a two-tailed, unpaired

t

-test. Differences were considered significant at a

p

value of <0.05 (* <0.05; ** <0.005).

Immunohistochemistry of mouse brain cryosections

The immersion-fixed and cryprotected frozen right hemispheres from wt and NPC1 mice were used to prepare 10 μm thick sagittal cryosections for histological analysis on a Leica CM 3050S cryotome. Sections were stored at -20°C until used for immunohistochemistry.

For immunohistochemistry, cryosections were briefly washed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS-T for 1 hour. Sections were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% goat serum in PBS-T overnight. After 3–5 hours incubation with secondary antibody (conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific), DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) was used to counterstain nuclei. Images were acquired on a Zeiss AX10 fluorescent microscope using the software AxioVision Release 4.8 (Zeiss).

Immunocytochemistry of mouse primary cortical neurons

Cortical neurons were isolated from postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse pups and grown as described previously [

24

]. Neurons were plated on poly-L-lysine (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich) coated glass coverslips (Marienfeld) and grown in Neurobasal medium complemented with 2% B27 and 2mM L-glutamine (all from Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunocytochemistry on cortical mouse neurons was performed as previously described [

14

]. In short, cortical neurons grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% sucrose/paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, quenched in 50mM ammonium chloride and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes. The neurons were blocked at room temperature for 1 hour in 5% goat serum (Sigma Aldrich). Neurons were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight, followed by secondary antibody incubation (Alexa Fluor 488, 594 and 647, Thermo Fisher Scientific) together with filipin (Sigma Aldrich, as described by Neufeld et al. 1999). Confocal images were acquired on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope Leica TCS SCP8. Images were acquired with the software LAS X (Leica) and additional image processing and were performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA).

Results

β-Secretase processing of Sez6, Sez6L and APP in NPC1 mouse brains

We firstly analysed protein levels of Sez6 and Sez6L, as well as APP, in wt and NPC1 mouse brains. For this, we monitored soluble and membrane-bound metabolites of Sez6, Sez6L and APP in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of 4- and 10-week old NPC1 mice compared to wt mice. The age of mice was selected based on the previously documented progression of the NPC disease in this mouse model (NPC1 mice usually die between 10–14 weeks of age) [

25

,

26

]. While 4-weeks old NPC1 mice seem to be unaffected, at 10-weeks there is a profound neurodegeneration, in particular of Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (

S1 Fig

), a characteristic feature of disease progression [

25

,

26

].

To analyse the soluble fragments and the full-length or membrane-bound proteins, mouse brains were sequentially homogenized in DEA (soluble fractions) and Triton X-100 (membrane-bound fractions) homogenization buffers [

10

]. In 4-weeks old NPC1 vs. wt mice, significantly increased levels of the soluble Sez6 (sSez6) and soluble Sez6L (sSez6L), as well as of total, soluble APP levels (sAPPt) were detected in the cortex and hippocampus (

Fig 1A, 1B and 1D–1F

). In the cerebellum at 4-weeks of age, however, only sSez6L levels were significantly enhanced in the NPC1 mice compared to the wt mice (

Fig 1C and 1E

). Although the levels of sSez6 and sAPPt seem to increase in cerebellum of NPC1 compared to wt mice, this did not reach statistical significance (

Fig 1C, 1D and 1F

). At this age, no changes in the levels of the corresponding full-length proteins Sez6, Sez6L and APP, as well as of BACE1, were detected in these brain regions (

S2 Fig

).

We also analysed the levels of sAPPβ, as sAPPβ is a direct product of APP processing by BACE1 alone, while sAPPt fragment results from both BACE1 and an α-secretase cleavage of APP. Significantly increased sAPPβ levels were detected in the cortex of the 4-weeks old NPC1 vs. wt mice (

Fig 2

), confirming an enhanced β-secretase processing of APP in the cortex of 4-weeks old NPC1 mice. We were unable to detect sAPPβ in the lysates of hippocampus and cerebellum of these mice.

At 10-weeks of age statistically significant changes in the levels of sSez6L were detected in all three brain regions analysed in NPC1 vs. wt mice (

Fig 3A–3C and 3E

). For sSez6, however, significantly increased levels were observed only in the cerebellum of NPC1 mice compared to wt ones (

Fig 3C and 3D

). No statistically significant changes in the levels of the full-length proteins Sez6, Sez6L, APP, as well as of BACE1, were detected at this age (

S3 Fig

). We were unable to detect sAPPβ fragment in mouse brain tissue lysates of mice at 10-weeks of age.

; N = 6) and NPC1 (NPC1

-/-

; N = 6) mice.

When comparing BACE1-mediated proteolysis of all three substrates between 4- and 10-weeks of age, we noticed an interestingly opposing trend of BACE1-proteolysis between Sez6 and Sez6L in the hippocampus and cerebellum of wt and NPC1 mice. While the levels of sSez6 in hippocampus substantially decreased by age (by nearly 4-fold), in the cerebellum they were markedly increased by nearly 5-fold (Figs

3D

vs.

1D

). In the cortex sSez6 levels were further increased with age (by almost 2-fold). Interestingly, significantly enhanced BACE1-cleavage of Sez6L persisted in all three brain regions in NPC1 mice at both 4- and 10-weeks of age (Figs

1E

and

3E

).

APP and BACE1 distribution in NPC1 mouse brains revisited

Previous work by Kodam et al. [

27

] showed that in NPC1 mouse brains APP intensely stained hippocampal neurons of the cornu ammonis regions 1–3 (CA1-3) and dentate gyrus (DG) as well as Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Interestingly, they also reported increased APP immunoreactivity in astrocytes in the hippocampus and cerebellum of 4-, 7- and 10-weeks old NPC1 mice. The reported false positive immunostaining of several widely used APP antibodies and the high specificity of a rabbit monoclonal antibody Y188 [

28

] prompted us to re-examine the distribution of endogenous APP in wt and in NPC1 mouse brains, respectively. In contrast to earlier study [

27

], we detected APP immunoreactivity specifically in neurons. Accordingly, we observed an intense staining of APP in hippocampal neurons (specifically pyramidal neurons of CA1, neurons in the hilus and granular neurons of DG), cortical neurons and in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (

Fig 4

). Also, similar distribution and levels of APP were observed between wt and NPC1 mice at both 4- (not shown) and 10-weeks of age, except that, due to profound neurodegeneration of Purkinje neurons in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice (

S1 Fig

) a substantial loss of APP intensity in Purkinje neurons was detected (

Fig 4

). Additionally, APP immunoreactivity did not resemble the enhanced staining pattern of astrocytes in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice (

S4 Fig

). The immunostaining of BACE1 revealed that there is no increased BACE1 staining in 4- (not shown) and 10-weeks old NPC1 vs. wt mouse brains that would be of relevance for the enhanced BACE1-proteolysis (

Fig 5

). BACE1 intensely stained mossy fibers in the hippocampus (

Fig 5

) as also recently reported by Kandalepas et al. [

29

]. There may be a slight decrease of BACE1 immunoreactivity in NPC1 mouse brains at 10-weeks of age most likely due to neuropathological processes at this stage. The specificity of the BACE1 antibody used was verified in BACE1 KO mouse brain slices which did not show any BACE1 immunoreactivity (

S5 Fig

).

Sez6 and Sez6L distribution in NPC1 mouse brains

Next, we performed immunohistochemistry of Sez6 and Sez6L in brain sections of 4- (not shown) and 10-week old NPC1 mice vs. wt mice. Both Sez6 and Sez6L showed a preferential neuronal-like staining (Figs

6

and

7

, respectively). Additionally, Sez6/Sez6L immunoreactivity did not resemble the enhanced staining pattern of astrocytes and microglia in 10-weeks old NPC1-mice (

S4

and

S6

Figs, respectively), indicating that these proteins are most likely not expressed in glial cells analysed. Sez6 showed strong neuronal-like cell body immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region, some in the hilus of DG and in deep layers of the cortex, as previously described by Gunnersen et al. [

21

] and by Osaki et al. [

22

]. Also, we detected Sez6 cell body immunoreactivity in the cerebellar molecular layer in 10-weeks old wt mice (

Fig 6

). We observed no changes of Sez6 levels and distribution in 4- (not shown) and 10-weeks old NPC1 vs. wt mice. Similarly, neuronal-like immunoreactivity of Sez6L was detected in the hippocampal CA regions, granular neurons of DG as well as in deep layers of cortex (

Fig 7

). Immunostaining of Sez6L in the hippocampus and cortex of 10-weeks old NPC1 mice did not differ from that in the wt mice. Interestingly, in 4- (not shown) and 10-weeks old wt mice Sez6L showed a strong immunoreactivity in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum which was lost upon Purkinje cell neurodegeneration in NPC1 mice (

Fig 7

).

DAPI (blue) was used to counterstain all nuclei. ca1, cornu ammonis 1; dg, dentate gyrus; mo, molecular layer; gr, granular layer.

DAPI (blue) was used to counterstain all nuclei. ca1, cornu ammonis 1; mo, molecular layer; gr, granular layer.

Subcellular distribution of Sez6, Sez6L and BACE1 in NPC1 primary mouse cortical neurons

In a previous study we showed that both NPC1-loss and NPC1-dysfunction, due to U18666A-treatment, caused sequestration of APP and BACE1 in acidic early/recycling endocytic compartments [

14

] in which BACE1 is the most active. We assumed that accumulation of the substrate APP and its cleaving enzyme BACE1 in this optimal subcellular environment causes enhanced β-secretase cleavage of APP in NPC disease, which we have previously described in Malnar et al. [

30

]. To test whether similar trafficking defect of BACE1 and its substrates, Sez6 and Sez6L, could be observed upon cholesterol accumulation due to NPC1 loss-of-function, we monitored the subcellular localization of BACE1 and Sez6 or Sez6L, in primary mouse cortical neurons isolated from NPC1

-/-

(NPC1) and NPC1

+/+

(wt) mice at postnatal day 0 (P0). NPC1 cortical neurons showed accumulation of free cholesterol in the cell body, as shown by filipin staining, and enlarged lysosomes (LAMP1)—characteristic features of NPC disease (Figs

8

and

9

). The endo/lysosomal markers of early endosomes (EEA1) and recycling endosomes (TfR) (Figs

8

and

9

) showed altered staining in NPC1 mouse primary cortical neurons, likely reflecting a cholesterol-mediated defect within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. We noticed more puncta of EEA1 and TfR in the processes of NPC1 cortical vs. wt neurons (Figs

8

and

9

). Sez6 and Sez6L in wt neurons were localized in the soma and in the neuronal processes (Figs

8

and

9

). Interestingly, in the NPC1 neurons their localization was more pronounced in the neuronal processes, especially for Sez6L (Figs

8

and

9

). Upon NPC1-loss, Sez6 and Sez6L showed no colocalization with cholesterol-rich late endosomes/lysosomes (stained with LAMP1 and filipin). Instead, we observed enhanced punctuate staining of both Sez6 and Sez6L with TfR in the soma as well in the neuronal processes of NPC1 vs. wt cortical neurons (Figs

8A

and

9B

). When Sez6L was co-stained with BACE1 we detected their increased immunoreactivity in the cell body of NPC1 vs. wt cortical neurons (

Fig 10

). Unfortunately, since both Sez6 and BACE1 antibodies were raised in rabbit we could not analyse their colocalization in mouse primary cortical neurons. Altogether, these results demonstrate that cholesterol accumulation due to NPC1-dysfunction causes altered trafficking of BACE1 substrates Sez6 and Sez6L, within the endolysosomal pathway.

Discussion

The protease BACE1 is currently the most promising drug target for developing treatments against AD [

18

,

31

]. The recently identified APP variant Ala673Thr, which is less efficiently cleaved by BACE1 [

32

], together with studies on AD-transgenic mice crossed with genetically deleted BACE1 mice, showing a decrease in Aβ levels and protection against AD and cognitive decline [

33

,

34

,

35

,

36

,

37

], strongly suggest that BACE1-inhibition should prove effective for AD treatment. However, recent studies on BACE1

-/-

mice have shown complex neurological phenotypes, raising a concern that a complete BACE1-inhibition might not be as safe as initially expected [

38

]. Indeed, recently several clinical trials were stopped because of unacceptable side-effects [

39

]. Such side-effects may result from a reduced cleavage of other physiologically relevant BACE1 substrates, as BACE1 has additional functions in the brain besides cleaving APP [

40

,

41

]. Thus, it is important to fully understand the basic biology of BACE1 and the effects of the cleavage of its substrates to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1 and make clinical trials safer.

In this work, we employed a single gene lysosomal disorder of cholesterol accumulation—NPC, which was previously shown to share several similarities with complex AD, to further characterize proteolysis carried out by BACE1. NPC disease is also referred to as “juvenile Alzheimer’s disease” and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration causing symptoms which include ataxia, dystonia, seizures and dementia. Here, we show for the first time that BACE1-dependent proteolytic cleavage is enhanced in a mouse model of NPC disease suggesting that upregulation of BACE1-dependent cleavage could represent an additional common feature between NPC disease and AD. To characterize BACE1 proteolysis in NPC disease, we tested Sez6 and Sez6L, which were shown to be predominantly cleaved by BACE1 in primary cultured neurons [

10

,

19

]. In parallel, we analysed proteolysis of APP which is, besides BACE1, also cleaved by another protease—ADAM10 [

18

,

20

]. In agreement with our previous result of increased amyloidogenic APP processing by BACE1 in the NPC1-null cellular model [

30

], here, we describe increased proteolysis of the BACE1 substrates Sez6 and its homolog Sez6L, as well as APP, in the cortex and the hippocampus of NPC1 mice at 4-weeks of age while, in the cerebellum, increased BACE1 proteolysis was prominent only for Sez6L protein. The detected upregulation of Sez6, Sez6L and APP cleavage by BACE1 in NPC1 mouse brains, at 4-weeks of age, i.e. early stages in NPC disease pathogenesis [

25

,

26

] is of particular relevance as it implies that enhanced BACE1-dependent cleavage is an early pathological event that precedes neurodegeneration and fully blown disease pathology. Increased BACE1 proteolysis could potentially be used as an early biomarker of NPC disease. It is worth to mention that the observed elevated BACE1 proteolysis of all three BACE1 substrates in nearly all three brain regions analysed (cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) indicates that their enhanced BACE1 cleavage at this age is likely to be a general effect of NPC1 loss-of-function. However, upon neurodegeneration at 10-weeks of age [

25

,

26

] increased BACE1-dependent proteolysis in NPC1 mice persisted only for Sez6L protein in all three brain regions analysed (it was even 2-fold increased in the cortex and hippocampus). Interestingly, Sez6 cleavage by BACE1 seemed to be strongly upregulated only in the cerebellum at this age, while it was substantially decreased in the hippocampus compared to the levels of cleaved Sez6 at 4-weeks of age. Although Sez6 and Sez6L belong to the family of Sez6 proteins, these results indicate that the efficacy of their cleavage by BACE1 is spatiotemporally differently regulated, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum (between 10- and 4-weeks of age), while it was similar in the cortex. At 10-weeks of age we also observed loss of immunoreactivity of APP and Sez6L in Purkinje neurons upon their degeneration in NPC1 vs. wt mice.

These results suggest that upregulation of soluble ectodomains of BACE1 substrates, such as Sez6 and Sez6L, could have important implications in NPC disease phenotype. Indeed, Gunnersen et al. [

21

] showed that secreted and membrane-bound isoforms of Sez6 exert opposing actions on neurite branching, indicating that secreted ectodomain of Sez6 (Sez6 isoform III) may act to enhance neurite number (to positively control dendritic branching) and, thus, influence synaptic connectivity. As synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature of both AD and NPC diseases, it remains to be determined whether BACE1 substrates, Sez6 and Sez6L, may play a role in NPC/AD disease pathogenesis. The common clinical features between these two disorders, such as dementia, presentation of seizures, dysarthria and dysphagia, indicate that both AD and NPC may share common molecular and/or cellular pathway(s) in the disease pathogenesis. A new data has recently been reported for the function of Sez6 protein in maintaining normal dendritic spine dynamics and synaptic structure and function, indicating that prolonged BACE1-inhibition impairs synaptic plasticity via Sez6 protein [

12

]. Since enhanced BACE1-proteolysis of Sez6L persisted in all three brain regions analysed at 4- and at 10-weeks of age of NPC1 mice, we reasoned that BACE1-inhibition may affect Sez6L function, in addition to Sez6 [

12

]. Further studies are, however, needed to clarify this in order to comprehend the consequence of prolonged BACE1-inhibition and its therapeutic potential against AD and, possibly, NPC disease.

This study is the first to provide data on spatiotemporal cleavage and distribution/localization of Sez6 and its homologue Sez6L in both wt and NPC1 mouse brains and primary cortical neurons. Distribution of Sez6L in the brains of wt and NPC1 mice was similar to that of Sez6 (mostly stained hippocampus and lower layers in the cortex), except for cerebellum which showed a strong Purkinje staining of Sez6L in wt-mice. Osaki et al. [

22

] have reported that immunoreactivity of Sez6 gradually decreased by age in the early postnatal period and in the adult forebrain (from P0-P14, and 10-months old mice), however, the strongest levels of Sez6 were detected in CA1 hippocampi, which is in accordance to our findings.

Due to neuropathological similarities between AD and NPC diseases, Kodam and colleagues previously examined protein levels and distribution of APP and its processing enzymes, β- and γ-secretase, in the same mouse model of NPC disease, as used in our study, and detected a statistically significant increase in BACE1 protein levels in NPC1 vs. wt mice in cerebellum at 7- and 10-weeks of age and in hippocampus at 10-weeks of age [

27

]. Although, in our study, we did not detect an increase in BACE1 protein levels in NPC1 vs. wt mice, our results demonstrate significantly increased processing of the exclusive BACE1 substrates Sez6 and Sez6L, as well as APP, in NPC1 mice, suggesting that BACE1-dependent cleavage in this mouse model of NPC disease is enhanced. Indeed, Kodam et al. [

27

] showed that activity of β-secretase (BACE1), but not that of α-secretase, was significantly increased both in the hippocampus and cerebellum of NPC1 mouse brains, supporting our findings.

Since it was recently reported that a number of antibodies used against APP are non-specific (as they showed immunoreactivity in APP KO brains), we re-examined APP distribution in NPC1 mice using the previously reported specific APP antibody Y188 (Epitomics, raised against the YENPTY motif at the C-terminal fragment of APP). Kodam et al. [

27

] also used APP antibody against C-terminal APP fragment (raised against 15 amino acids at the C-terminus followed by the c-Myc epitope) [

42

]. Our results of APP immunostaining in NPC1 vs. wt mouse brains using the Y188 APP antibody are similar to findings by Kodam et al. [

27

] showing a profound APP loss in Purkinje neurons at 10-weeks of age. APP was mainly detected in neurons, in accord with the earlier study by Guo et al. [

28

]. In contrast to Kodam et al. [

27

], we did not observe the increased levels of fl-APP in the hippocampus and cerebellum of 10-weeks old NPC1 vs. wt mice.

Furthermore, our results on NPC1 mouse primary cortical neurons show that a trafficking defect of BACE1 and its substrates Sez6 and Sez6L, within the endosomal compartments may explain the mechanistic details of enhanced cleavage by BACE1 in a mouse model of NPC disease. In line with our previous results on APP and BACE1 [

14

] we show that cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 vs. wt mouse primary cortical neurons causes sequestration of the enzyme BACE1 and its substrates Sez6 and Sez6L within the endolysosomal compartments. As these acidic organelles present an optimal environment for the enzyme BACE1 to cleave its substrates, we assume that, in addition to APP, Sez6 and Sez6L, and any other BACE1 substrate that is functionally linked to endolysosomal routing would display its enhanced proteolysis by BACE1 in NPC disease. Our immunocytochemistry results revealed somewhat different subcellular localization of Sez6 and its homologue Sez6L. While Sez6 was localized in the somatodendritic region in wt cortical neurons (in accord to the findings described by Gunnersen et al. [

21

] and by Osaki et al. [

22

]), Sez6L was mainly found in the soma and axons in wt cortical neurons and was distributed in larger puncta throughout the neuronal processes in NPC1 cortical neurons. The described different spatiotemporal BACE1-cleavage of Sez6 and Sez6L in NPC1-mouse brains in this work, implies that these BACE1 substrates, although being members of the same Sez6 protein family, may exert somewhat different but complementary functions.

In NPC disease, disturbed cholesterol trafficking and its accumulation within the late endosomes/lysosomes due to

NPC1

/

NPC2

dysfunction is the primary cause of the endolysosomal defect. Indeed, cholesterol-depletion by hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) showed beneficial effects in NPC1 mice [

43

,

44

] and in a single NPC patient [

45

]. We propose that altered trafficking within the endolysosomal system caused by cholesterol accumulation may lead to some neuropathological features of NPC disease, including those mediated by altered BACE1-proteolysis of Sez6 and Sez6L proteins. Future studies are needed to better evaluate the potential role of Sez6 and Sez6L in NPC disease pathogenesis as well as to investigate the use of their enhanced BACE1-proteolysis as diagnostic and/or therapeutic biomarkers of NPC disease.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we show here for the first time that NPC1 loss-of-function in a mouse model of NPC disease leads to enhanced cleavage of BACE1 substrates Sez6 and Sez6L, in addition to APP, and that this effect most likely involves altered trafficking of BACE1 and of its substrates within the endolysosomal system. In this work we also describe the spatiotemporal distribution and processing of Sez6 and Sez6L, members of Sez6 family, in wt and NPC1-mouse brains. We show that the efficacy of Sez6 cleavage by BACE1 may be spatiotemporally differently regulated, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, in contrast to the cleavage of Sez6L. This study suggests that enhanced BACE1-regulated proteolysis may play a role in NPC disease pathogenesis. Both AD and NPC diseases are still untreatable disorders. Thus, understanding the basic biology of BACE1 and the effects of the cleavage of its substrates is important to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1.

#### SEZ6L - Article 3: The Sez6 Family Inhibits Complement by Facilitating Factor I Cleavage of C3b and Accelerating the Decay of C3 Convertases
<Date>: 2021-4-15
<PMCID>: 8081827
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

The Sez6 family, consisting of Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2, is notable because its members have been identified as potential susceptibility genes for multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including: autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder (

1

–

9

). Sez6L2 is located in the 16p11.2 deletion/duplication region which encompasses 26 genes and accounts for ~1% of all autism spectrum disorder cases, but also has strong links to schizophrenia and intellectual disability (

3

,

4

,

10

). Sez6 family proteins are expressed by neurons throughout the brain during development and in adulthood. Some brain regions express multiple Sez6 family members, suggesting possible redundancy, while other regions have differential expression (

11

–

15

). In experimental mouse models, the Sez6 family has been shown to modulate synapse numbers, synaptic plasticity, and dendrite morphology in the cortex and hippocampus and neuronal connectivity in the cerebellum. Genetic loss of Sez6 genes results in impaired cognition, motor learning, and motor functions (

13

–

16

). Outside the nervous system, Sez6 family members have been implicated as markers of poor prognosis in cancer (

17

–

23

). Although a few binding partners of the Sez6 family have been proposed (

24

–

28

), the molecular mechanisms and functions of Sez6 proteins are still unclear.

The domain structure of Sez6 family members consisting of 5 complement control protein (CCP) domains and 2-3 CUB domains, suggest they may have activity connected to the complement cascade. CCP domains, also known as short consensus repeats or SUSHI repeats, contain 60-70 amino acids with four invariant cysteines forming disulfide bonds. CCP domains are the primary components of several proteins of the complement system (

29

,

30

). However, CCP domains are also found in a variety of proteins outside the complement pathway involved in cell adhesion, blood coagulation, and signal transduction related to cytokines and neurotransmission (

29

–

32

). CUB domains are named after their founding members: complement C1r/C1s, uEGF, and BMP1 and primarily mediate protein-protein interactions that are often calcium-dependent. CUB domains are found in complement proteins such as C1s, C1r, MASP-1/2, and C3 as well as many other non-complement pathway proteins (

33

,

34

). In addition to the CCP and CUB domains, Sez6 proteins have a single transmembrane domain and short cytoplasmic tail. The goal of this study was to evaluate the Sez6 family for complement regulatory functions.

The complement system has three initiating pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin) that all create C3 convertases to cleave C3 [reviewed in (

35

,

36

)]. The classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase is composed of C4b2b [formerly called C4b2a (

37

)]. The alternative pathway convertase is composed of C3bBb. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 generates the chemotactic peptide C3a, as well as, C3b, which covalently attaches to activating surfaces such as antibody complexes, cellular debris, foreign particles, or even an organism’s own healthy “self” tissue. C3b and its degradation products iC3b and C3dg/d are opsonins that facilitate phagocytosis. When C3b is sufficiently accumulated, it associates with C3 convertases to form C5 convertases. C5 convertases cleave C5 to initiate the lytic complement pathway leading to cell lysis.

Complement activation on “self” surfaces is controlled by a group of complement regulatory proteins. A common feature of complement regulators that inhibit C3 convertases is the presence of three or more tandem CCP domains (

29

,

38

). The most well-known CCP containing complement regulators are DAF/CD55, MCP/CD46, and CR1 (or Crry in rodents) which are membrane-associated and Factor H (FH) and C4BP, which are soluble circulating factors (

35

,

36

). Complement regulators can deactivate C3 convertases by dissociating the protease subunits (Bb/2b) from the non-catalytic subunits (C3b/C4b), which has been defined as “decay accelerating” activity. Complement regulators can also facilitate cleavage of C3b or C4b by functioning as cofactors for the protease, complement Factor I (

29

,

36

,

38

). Cleaved C3b fragments (iC3b, C3c, C3dg/d) or C4b fragments can no longer function as subunits for C3 or C5 convertases.

The complement system is a fundamental part of the innate immune system, but it also has important roles in neural development. These roles include neurogenesis, synapse pruning, and neuronal migration (

39

–

44

). The complement pathway additionally mediates immune responses to prenatal or early postnatal brain insults that affect brain development with lifelong consequences [reviewed in (

44

)]. Furthermore, complement contributes to pathological cell and synapse loss in aging and diseases including Alzheimer’s, viral encephalitis, glaucoma, lupus, epilepsy, schizophrenia, frontotemporal dementia, and multiple sclerosis (

39

–

41

,

45

–

58

). Therefore, understanding complement regulation in the brain is important for neurodevelopment as well as neurodegenerative disease. We show here that members of the Sez6 family are novel complement regulators that inhibit the complement pathway at the level of C3 convertases.

Materials and Methods

Purified Proteins

Cloning and Plasmids: The expression plasmid for Sez6L2-MH, a truncated version of human Sez6L2 that has the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region replaced by a tandem Myc/6x-His tag, was cloned using PCR from the Sez6L2 NCBI Refseq BC000567 cDNA (similar to NM_001114100.2; Uniprot ACC: Q6UXD5-6); and the following primers: 5’–GACTCGAGAATTCGCGGCCGCCACCATGGGGACTCCCAGGGCCCAGCA-3’ and 5’-TTCTAGAAAGCTTGGTACCTCCCCCCCTTCCAGCTGCCGTGATGG-3’. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes Not1 and HindIII and cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid, pEZYmyc-His [Addgene plasmid #18701;

http://n2t.net/addgene:18702

; RRID: Addgene_18701; a gift from Yu-Zhu Zhang (

59

)], that was digested with the same enzymes. The human His-DAF plasmid from Sino Biological (HG10101-NH; modified from NCBI RefSeq NM_000574.3) was used for protein production of H-DAF.

His-Tagged Protein Purification (Sez6L2-MH and H-DAF): FreeStyle 293-F cells grown in serum-free FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco, 12338-018) were transfected with Sez6L2-MH or His-DAF plasmids using Fectopro (Polyplus, 116-001). After 48-72 hours, media was collected and His-tagged proteins were bound using HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (ThermoFisher; 88221) in the presence of Calbiochem’s EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail 1:1000 (MilliporeSigma; Set V; 539137). Bound proteins were eluted in 250 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7.4 and filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane (such as MilliporeSigma, SCGP00525). Elutions were then either dialyzed with PBS overnight (MWCO 12-14K, Spectrum Spectra/Por Molecular porous tubing, 132706) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra filters MWCO-10K or 30K (MilliporeSigma; 10K: UFC901024, 30K: UFC903024) or directly concentrated and subjected to multiple rounds of buffer exchange to PBS using the Amicon Ultra filters or a similar product (Pierce 30K MWCO concentrator, 88529). If protein concentration resulted in visible protein aggregates, the solution was again filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane (such as MilliporeSigma Millex-GV4 SLGVL0405). Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm with a 1% extinction coefficient correction (E1%) of 11.4 for Sez6L2-MH and 10.6 for H-DAF. The 1% extinction coefficients were calculated based off the amino acid sequence using ProtParam (

http://www.protparam.net/index.html

). Protein aliquots were frozen and stored at -80°C.

Other Purified Proteins: The negative control protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was purchased from MilliporeSigma (A3294). In order to make the BSA solution as similar to Sez6L2-MH and H-DAF as possible, we processed BSA through the last steps of the His-tagged protein purification protocol. Specifically, we dissolved the lyophilized BSA in PBS with 250 mM imidazole (the same buffer used to eluted proteins from HisPur Ni-NTA Resin). The BSA solution was then concentrated, exchanged to plain PBS, and stored at -80°C. All other purified proteins were purchased from CompTech: C1s-enzyme (A104), C2 (A112), C3 (A113); C3b (A114), iC3b (A115), C3d (A117), C4 (A105), C4b (A108), C4bBP (A109), Factor B (A135), Factor D (A136), Factor H (A137), Factor I (A138). These proteins were purified from human serum and were in PBS.

Hemolytic Assay

Classical pathway: Complement mediated lysis of erythrocytes releases hemoglobin that can be measured by absorbance spectrophotometry at 415 nm. Antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA; CompTech; B200) were rinsed and diluted in GVB

pH 7.3). 5 µM of Sez6L2-MH or other purified proteins were pre-incubated in a v-bottom 96 well plate for 15 minutes on ice with 0.275% normal human serum (NHS, CompTech) in a final 90 µl buffer solution equivalent to 40% GVB

and 50% PBS with 0.15 mM CaCl

and 0.5 mM MgCl

(PBS

). Next, 10 µl of EAs (4x10

cells/mL in GVB

) were added to each sample and the plate was incubated at 37⁰C for 30 minutes. During this incubation, cells were suspended with a multichannel pipet every 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of cold GVBE buffer (0.1% gelatin, 5 mM Veronal, 145 mM NaCl, 0.025% NaN

3

, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.3). Remaining erythrocytes were pelleted by centrifugation at 500xg for 3 minutes. 150 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well plate and measured for absorbance at 415 nm using a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax M5). The absorbance obtained with just buffer, NHS, and EAs was set at 100% lysis and the absorbance obtained without serum added or when GVBE was used in place of GVB

++

to inhibit complement was set at 0% lysis. Absorbance from full lysis in each experiment was also determined by replacing PBS with H

0 (at 50% final sample volume). Prior to testing the efficacy of complement inhibitors, the amount of each lot of normal human serum necessary to lyse EAs to 80-90% of the absorbance obtained by H

2

0 samples was determined by testing a range of NHS concentrations from 0-2%. These titrations were done to ensure that inhibitors were not overwhelmed by saturating levels of complement activity. The titrations revealed that 80-90% lysis was usually obtained with 0.25-0.4% serum.

Alternative Pathway: The alternative pathway hemolytic assays were performed similar to the classical pathway assay except that plain rabbit erythrocytes (Er, CompTech) were rinsed and diluted in GVB° (0.1% gelatin, 5 mM Veronal, 145 mM NaCl, 0.025% NaN

3

, pH 7.3). 5 µM Sez6L2-MH or other purified proteins were pre-incubated for 15 minutes on ice with 6.5-7% normal human serum in a final 95 µl buffer solution containing 10 mM MgCl

2

and 10 mM EGTA and the equivalence of 45% GVB° and 50% PBS. Next, 5 µl of Ers (5x10

8

cells/mL in GVB°) were added to each sample and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and processed similar to the classical hemolysis experiments. The 415 nm absorbance obtained with just buffer, NHS, and Ers was set at 100% lysis.

Cleavage of C3b or C4b by Factor I

C3b (1.5 µM; 3.94 µg) or C4b (1.5 µM; 4.05 µg) was incubated with 0.5 µM Factor I alone or in the presence of 1 µM FH, 1 µM C4BP, or 1-8 µM Sez6L2 in PBS

++

(Total volume ~15 µl) for 15 minutes-8 hours at 37°C. The samples were then run on reducing SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by western blot or Imperial Blue (Coomassie) staining to identify C3 or C4 cleavage products.

Decay Accelerating ELISAs

Alternative C3 Convertase Decay Assay: An ELISA-based assay was used to measure decay accelerating activity towards the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. ELISA plates (Nunc, MaxiSorp, 96 well plates, 44-2404-21) were coated with 100 µl human C3b at 3-3.5 µg/mL (17-20 nM) in PBS for ~20 hours at room temperature. Wells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30-60 minutes at room temperature. Wells were again washed twice with PBS. C3 convertase was formed by incubating with Factor B (5.8-10 nM) and Factor D (1.8-2.0 nM) in GVB° buffer with 3.5 mM NiCl

2

at 37°C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, wells were washed three times with PBSt (0.1% tween). Factor H and Sez6L2-MH were mixed at various concentrations ranging from 0-6 µM (0 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL) in solutions with a final composition of 90 µL PBS to 225 µL GVB° with 3.5 mM NiCl

2

. 100 µl of the Factor H or Sez6L2-MH mixtures were added to the plate in triplicate and incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes. Supernatants were collected for western blot analysis and the wells were washed three times with PBSt. Residual Bb on the plate was detected using polyclonal goat anti-Factor B (CompTech, A235, 1:4,000) for one hour at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBSt and incubated with a donkey HRP-conjugated anti-Goat IgG (Azure Biosystems, AC2149, 1:10,000) for 45 minutes at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with PBSt prior to colorimetric development using TMB substrate (ThermoScientific, N301). 0.16 M sulfuric acid was used to stop the reaction. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Percent convertase remaining was calculated with the following formula = ((Ab450 inhibitor – Ab450 background)/(A450 buffer – Ab450 background)) x 100. Background values were obtained from wells not coated with C3b but incubated with Factor B and D. Nonlinear regression utilized a variable slope and four parameters.

Classical/Lectin C3 Convertase Decay Assay: This ELISA-based assay was performed similar to the C3bBb assay outlined above but with the following changes: Plates were coated with 3 µg/mL (16.7 nM) C4b in PBS. After washing and blocking with 1% BSA, C3 convertases were formed by incubating with C2 (6-12 nM) and C1s-enzyme (4 nM) in GVB++ at 37°C for 30-60 minutes. After, wells were washed three times with PBS

++

. H-DAF and Sez6L2-MH were mixed at various concentrations ranging from 0-7 µM in solutions with a final composition of 50% GVB

++

and 50% PBS

++

. 100 µl of the H-DAF or Sez6L2-MH mixtures were added to the plate in triplicate and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Wells were washed three times with PBSt

++

(containing 0.1% tween). Residual C2b/C2 on the plate was detected using polyclonal goat anti-C2 (CompTech, A212, 1:6,000 in PBSt

++

) for 45 minutes at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBSt

++

and then incubated with a donkey HRP-conjugated anti-Goat IgG (Azure Biosystems, AC2149 1:10,000 in PBSt

++

) for 45 minutes at room temperature and then processed as above. Background values were obtained from wells not coated with C4b but incubated with C2 and C1s-enzyme.

Flow Cytometry

CHO cells (a Chinese hamster ovary cell line) were grown in serum-free Freestyle media (Gibco, 12651-014) and transfected with human cDNA expression plasmids with N-terminal Myc-tags obtained from Sino Biological: M-SEZ6L2 (HG13969-NM; modified from NCBI RefSeq BC000567, similar to NM_001114100.2; Uniprot ACC: Q6UXD5-6), M-SEZ6 (HG13436-NM; modified from NCBI RefSeq NM_178860.4; Uniprot ACC: Q53EL9-1), M-SEZ6L (HG20982-NM; modified from NM_001184773.1; Uniprot ACC: Q9BYH1-6), M-MCP (HG12239-NM; modified from NCBI RefSeq BC030594), or M-CR2 (HG10811-NM; modified from NCBI RefSeq NM_001877.3) using FectoPro transfection reagent (Polyplus, 116-001). Alternatively, cells were transfected with a GFP expression plasmid or co-transfected with GFP and M-SEZ6L2 or HIS-tagged DAF (H-DAF; Sino Biological HG10101-NH; modified from NCBI RefSeq NM_000574.3). After 18-24 hours, the cells were collected and loaded at 4x10

5

cells per well in a 96-well v-bottom plate. To assay the activity of the classical complement pathway, CHO cells were sensitized with a 30 minute incubation with rabbit anti-hamster lymphocyte serum (1:10; Cedarlane, CLA14940) in 100 µl cold FACs buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with FACs buffer then incubated with 15% C5-depleted human serum (CompTech, A320) or a range of C5-depleted serum from 0-20% in GVB++ at 37°C for 60 minutes. After washing twice with cold FACs buffer, cells were incubated with a mouse anti-human C3b/iC3b APC conjugated antibody (1:50; Biolegend, 846106, clone 3E7) and mouse anti-Myc Alexa488 conjugated antibody (1:50; Cell Signaling Technologies, 2279S, clone 9B11) for 30 minutes at 4°C. For samples transfected with GFP, only the anti-C3 APC antibody was used. After two washes in FACs buffer, cells were resuspended in FACs buffer with 1 µl propidium iodide (PI, Invitrogen, BMS500PI) and processed using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. Data was analyzed by FlowJo™ Software (Windows Version 10.6.1: Ashland, OR: Becton, Dickinson and Company; 2019). Data were gated for the single cell population (FSC-A:FSC-H) and PI negative population. To assay the alternative pathway, cells were processed as above except they were sensitized with only a low level of anti-hamster lymphocyte serum (1:50) and the 20% C5-depleted serum was diluted in GVB° with 10 mM EGTA and 10 mM MgCl

to block the classical pathway.

Western Blot

Supernatants from decay accelerating ELISA’s or Factor I cleavage assays were mixed with SDS-loading dye and run on 8-15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBSt (Tris buffered saline (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 minutes and probed with primary antibodies: polyclonal goat anti-C3d (R&D systems, AF2655, 1:1000), polyclonal sheep anti-Sez6L2 (R&D Systems, AF4916; 1:2000), monoclonal mouse anti-Myc (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; 9E10, 1:2000), polyclonal goat anti-Factor B (CompTech, A235, 1:1000) in 5% milk in TBSt for one hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed three times in TBSt and then incubated with HRP secondary antibodies (anti-Mouse HRP, BioRad, 170-6516, 1:5,000; anti-Goat HRP Azure Biosystems, AC2149, 1:10,000; anti-Sheep HRP, Jackson Labs, 713-035-003, 1:1000) for one hour at room temperature in 5% milk in TBSt. After washing we applied ECL substrate (Pierce) and developed membranes using a digital imager (Azure Biosystems). Some membranes were stripped using buffer consisting of 200 mM glycine; 0.1% SDS, 1% Tween 20, pH 2.2 and re-probed. Western blot band densities were quantitated using Image J/FIJI.

). They are also known as BSRP TKO mice and were supplied by co-author Dr. Jenny Gunnersen, University of Melbourne; Australia. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and intracardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing EDTA (1.5 mg/ml) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were post-fixed for 18-30 hours in 4% PFA, then stored in PBS at 4°C. Brains were cut into 40 μm-thick coronal sections using a vibratome (Leica V1000) and stored in a cryoprotectant mixture of 30% PEG300, 30% glycerol, 20% 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and 20% ddH

O at −20°C. IHC was performed on free-floating sections. The sections were washed three times for 30 minutes in PBS to remove the cryoprotectant. Then sections were incubated in 100 mM glycine in PBS for 30 minutes followed by citrate antigen unmasking at 37°C for 30 minutes (Vector, H3300 with 0.05% tween 20). Sections were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (consisting of 1.5% BSA (MilliporeSigma; A3294), 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, 017-000-121), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Promega, H5142), and 1.8% NaCl in PBS) with donkey anti-mouse Fab fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 715-007-003; 1:300). Sections were then washed three times in PBS with 1.8% NaCl. Primary antibodies: polyclonal sheep anti-Sez6L2 (R&D Systems, AF4916,1:500) and polyclonal chicken anti-Homer1 (Synaptic Systems, 160006, 1:500) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with brain sections for 1-3 days at room temperature with agitation. Sections were then washed three times for 30 minutes in 1× PBS with 1.8% NaCl and then incubated overnight at room temperature in Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500 Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Alexa 488 Donkey anti-sheep, Cat# 713-545-147, RRID: AB_2340745; and Alexa 647 Donkey anti-chicken, Cat# 703-605-155, RRID: AB_2340379) in blocking buffer. Finally, sections were washed three times with PBS with 1.8% NaCl, mounted on slides with Prolong Diamond mounting agents with DAPI (Life Technologies; P36962).

IHC sections were imaged with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera on an Olympus BX-51 upright microscope with Quioptic Optigrid optical sectioning hardware with a 10x, NA 0.4 or 60x, NA 1.4 objective with

Statistics

GraphPad Prism software version 8.3.0 for Windows (La Jolla California USA) was used to perform all statistics. Statistical analysis was generally performed with one-way ANOVAs followed by Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test (MCT). For the CHO cell C3b/iC3b deposition assays, Myc-positive and Myc-negative populations within the same sample were first compared with multiple t tests. Then, p values were corrected with Holm’s-Sidak’s MCT for the many samples within the experiment. N values for each experiment are specifically stated and defined in the figure legends. We defined significance as

p <

Expression of Sez6 Family Proteins and Other Complement Regulatory Proteins in Hippocampal Neurons

Self-directed complement activity is usually tightly controlled by complement regulatory proteins expressed on cell membranes and/or secreted in soluble form. However, the identity of complement regulators functioning on neurons throughout neuronal development or in disease with a potential role for modulating complement-mediated synaptic pruning has yet to be fully elucidated. Because hippocampal neurons express only trace amounts of the most well-known complement regulators of the early complement pathways (DAF, CR1/Crry, FH, C4BP, MCP or C1-INH (

60

) (

Figure 1A

), we searched the smart protein database (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) for proteins with at least three tandem CCP domains that are also highly expressed by neurons in development. We identified the Sez6 family of proteins (consisting of Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2) as ideal candidates. RNA-Seq expression data from the Hipposeq database [

http://hipposeq.janelia.org

(

60

)] show that the Sez6 family members are expressed by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus with differential expression in CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (

Figure 1A

). Immunostaining of adult mouse brain sections shows the Sez6L2 is highly localized to neuronal cell bodies of the CA1 region. Diffuse Sez6L2 is also found throughout the neuropil of the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens where a subset of Sez6L2 puncta co-localize with synapses (identified as Homer1+ puncta) (

Figures 1B, C

).

Figure 1

Sez6 family expression in the hippocampus.

(A)

Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2 are expressed by principal (excitatory, pyramidal) neurons of the mouse hippocampus at much higher levels than other known complement regulators (namely Crry, C4BP, CFH, C1-INH, DAF, and MCP). Expression data was obtained from Hipposeq: a comprehensive RNA-Seq database of gene expression in hippocampal principal neurons [

http://hipposeq.janelia.org

(

)]. The RNA samples used in this database were isolated from mouse hippocampal principal neurons micro-dissected from the CA1, CA3, or Dentate Gyrus (DG) cell layers of the hippocampus at Postnatal Day 25-32. Differential gene expression is shown in the heatmap with the relative units of FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of Exon per Million Reads Mapped.)

(B)

Brain sections from adult WT mice or Sez6 triple knockout mice (TKO) were immuno-stained for Sez6L2 (green) and DAPI and imaged in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Scale Bar= 27 µm. High density Sez6L2 staining occurs around cell bodies in the pyramidal layer, but significant Sez6L2 is also found in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens.

(C)

Higher magnification images of sections immuno-stained for Sez6L2 (green) and the postsynaptic protein, Homer1 (red), shows a subset of Sez6L2 is found near or co-localized with synapses in the stratum radiatum. Scale bar = 1.8 µm.

Sez6 Proteins Limit C3b/iC3b Opsonization of CHO Cells by the Classical and Alternative Pathways

After having identified the Sez6 family as potential complement regulators due to their domain structure, we sought experimental evidence to support this putative function. First, we examined whether Sez6L2 expressed on CHO cells could reduce the amount of C3b/iC3b on the cell surface generated by the classical pathway. For the first set of experiments we used cells expressing the complement inhibitor, DAF, as a positive control. CHO cells were transfected with GFP alone or co-transfected with GFP and Myc-tagged Sez6L2 (M-Sez6L2) or His-tagged DAF (H-DAF). The cells were coated in antibodies and then exposed to C5-depleted human serum ranging in concentration from 0-20%. C5-depleted serum was used to prevent cell lysis, but still allow full C3b deposition by the classical pathway, which was detected with antibodies to C3b/iC3b. GFP positive cells co-transfected with M-Sez6L2 showed ~50% reduction of C3b/iC3b at all serum levels compared to CHO cells transfected with GFP alone (at 15% serum p=0.007, Holm-Sidak MCT) (

Figures 2A, B

). Cells expressing H-DAF reduced C3b/iC3b opsonization to ~13-15% compared to GFP alone (at 15% serum p=0.001). Thus, Sez6L2 does have complement inhibitory activity.

CHO cells were coated with antibodies and exposed to 0-20% C5-depleted human serum for one hour and then immuno-stained with anti-C3b/iC3b antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Next we compared the complement inhibitory activity of Sez6L2 to its family members Sez6 and Sez6L to learn whether complement inhibition is a family function or limited to Sez6L2. Sez6 and Sez6L are 49% and 50% identical to Sez6L2 respectively (

Figure 2C

). We also compared the Sez6 family members to two other Myc-tagged CCP domain-containing proteins, MCP and CR2. MCP is a transmembrane complement inhibitor composed of four CCP domains (

61

,

62

). CR2 is a transmembrane protein composed of 15-16 tandem CCP domains, but it is not a complement inhibitor. However, CR2 does binds C3d/C3dg to present complement opsonized antigens to the adaptive immune system as well as initiate signal transduction cascades (

63

). It can also enhance C3b deposition by the alternative pathway on expressing cells (

64

,

65

) and serves as a control in this paradigm for what excessive complement opsonization looks like. Mock transfected cells and cells without serum exposure were used as controls for full complement activation or a negative baseline respectively. First we assayed the amount of C3b/iC3b on cells initiated primarily by the classical pathway. M-Sez6L2, M-Sez6, M-Sez6L, and M-MCP all significantly decreased C3b/iC3b and M-CR2 significantly increased C3b/iC3b on expressing cells compared to non-transfected, Myc-negative cells within each experimental sample (

Figures 2D–F

). Overall, M-Sez6 was the most effective at decreasing C3b/iC3b opsonization as Myc-positive cells had only 17 ± 3% of the C3b/iC3b found on the Myc-negative cells in the same sample (p<0.001, Holm-Sidak MCT). M-Sez6L2 expressing cells had 52 ± 5% of C3b/iC3b compared to Myc-negative cells (p<0.001), M-Sez6L had 79 ± 3% (p=0.004), and M-MCP had 45 ± 6% (p<0.001). On the other hand, M-CR2 had 407 ± 78% the level of C3b/iC3b of internal Myc-negative cells P<0.001) (

Figure 2F

). These results show that Sez6 family members share the complement inhibitory function but have different levels of activity. Sez6 is the most effective inhibitor of the classical pathway. Sez6L2 is a moderate inhibitor and functions at a level comparable to MCP. Sez6L is a weak inhibitor.

Because M-Sez6 expressed on the cell surface at twice the level of Sez6L2, Sez6L, and MCP (

Figure 2G

), but usually in a similar percentage of cells (

Figure 2H

), we wondered whether M-Sez6 was a more effective inhibitor simply because of the higher expression levels or whether there are intrinsic activity differences in the family members. Thus we gated the cell populations based on increasing levels of Myc surface expression to compare C3b/iC3b opsonization levels in cells with similar levels of surface M-Sez6, M-Sez6L or M-Sez6L2. The results suggest that all Sez6 family members inhibit complement better with higher surface expression. However, M-Sez6 was still more effective at limiting C3b/iC3b opsonization than M-Sez6L and M-Sez6L2 at all expression levels (

Figure 2I

).

Next, full-length Sez6L2, Sez6, and Sez6L were analyzed for their ability to inhibit complement opsonization initiated primarily by the alternative pathway in the presence of Mg-EGTA. The results were similar to that obtained with the classical pathway and showed all Sez6 family members to be effective inhibitors of alternative pathway C3b/iC3b opsonization. However, their activities relative to each other were different (

Figures 3A–C

). M-Sez6L2 expressing cells had 34 ± 1%, M-Sez6 had 59 ± 2%, M-Sez6L had 52 ± 6%, M-MCP had 65 ± 2% and M-CR2 had 2624 ± 256% the level of deposited C3b/iC3b compared to Myc-negative cells within the same samples (

Figure 3C

). C3b/iC3b opsonization by the alternative pathway was less intense than the classical pathway and resulted in C3b/iC3b coated cells segregating into two main population peaks. The primary peak population had low C3b/iC3b opsonization. The second peak population contained less cells than the primary peak, but these cells were opsonized with high levels of C3b/iC3b that were almost equivalent to the levels found in the classical pathway assays. M-Sez6L2, M-Sez6, Sez6L, and M-MCP all prevented expressing cells from reaching the complement opsonization levels of the high C3b/iC3b peak population (

Figure 3A

). Alternatively, M-CR2 increased C3b/iC3b levels on expressing cells, shifting all Myc-positive cells into the high C3b/iC3b opsonized population. Interestingly, M-Sez6L2 expressing cells also had decreased C3b/iC3b levels in the lower peak population relative to the non-transfected, Myc-negative cells within the same sample (

Figures 3A, B

). However, these Myc-negative cells in M-Sez6L2 samples often had increased C3b/iC3b opsonization compared with the Myc-negative cells in other samples raising the question of whether M-Sez6L2 protects expressing cells at the expense of promoting complement opsonization on non-expressing cells. Nevertheless, the cells expressing Sez6 family members had less complement opsonization by the alternative pathway than non-expressing cells and their complement inhibitory activity equaled or exceeded the activity of the known complement regulator MCP. In summary, Sez6 family members are inhibitors of C3b/iC3b complement opsonization by both the classical and alternative pathways, but individual Sez6 family members vary in the efficacy of their complement inhibitory activity toward each pathway.

Recombinant Sez6L2-MH Is a Soluble, Truncated Form of Sez6L2 With a Myc-6xHis Tag

In order to determine the specific mechanisms by which Sez6L2 inhibits complement using traditional assays, we generated a truncated expression construct of human Sez6L2, named Sez6L2-MH, which replaced the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail with a tandem Myc-6xHis tag. This plasmid was expressed in HEK293 cells grown in serum free media and the secreted protein was purified

via

the His-tag. The purity and identity of the Sez6L2-MH protein were verified by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie staining and anti-Sez6L2 or anti-Myc western blots (

Figures 4A, B

).

Sez6L2-MH Partially Inhibits Alternative Pathway Hemolysis and Only Modestly Inhibits the Classical Pathway Hemolysis

Complement activation by the classical and alternative pathways ultimately results in the formation of the membrane attack complex which directly lyses target cells. As such, complement-mediated lysis of erythrocytes, also known as hemolysis, is a useful assay to measure the ability of Sez6L2-MH to regulate the complement pathway. We tested Sez6L2-MH alongside complement inhibitory proteins FH, C4BP, and C1-INH purified from human serum and His-tagged DAF (H-DAF) purified similarly to Sez6L2-MH. BSA was also tested as a negative control protein. Sez6L2-MH was able to only modestly inhibit complement-mediated lysis of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes by the classical pathway, exhibiting 90.4 ± 1.2% lysis compared to 100.0 ± 2.1% lysis by buffer alone (p=0.013; Holm-Sidak MCT;

Figure 4C

). The other complement inhibitory proteins efficiently and significantly prevented lysis (H-DAF: -1.0 ± 0.2%; FH: 14.8 ± 2.2%; C4BP 26.1 ± 7.5%; C1-INH: 14.4 ± 8.1% lysis). As expected, BSA had no effect on erythrocyte lysis by the classical pathway (100.2 ± 3% lysis).

A similar hemolysis assay was used for the alternative pathway and was performed in the presence of EGTA. The initiating steps of the classical and lectin pathways requires calcium, which is preferentially chelated by EGTA, effectively preventing classical and lectin pathway initiation while sparing the alternative pathway. Sez6L2-MH was able to partially inhibit rabbit erythrocyte lysis by the alternative pathway, showing 65.2 ± 11.1% lysis compared to 100 ± 0.7% lysis by buffer alone (p<0.001;

Figure 4D

). Comparatively, H-DAF and FH fully prevent lysis to 3.2 ± 1.3% and 1.9 ± 1.2% respectively. In contrast, the negative control BSA resulted in no change in erythrocyte lysis compared to buffer alone (98.1 ± 5.3%). In summary, recombinant Sez6L2-MH is a weak inhibitor of hemolysis mediated by the classical pathway and a moderate inhibitor of hemolysis mediated by the alternative pathway.

Sez6L2-MH Functions as a Cofactor for Fluid-Phase Factor I (FI) Cleavage of C3b but Not C4b

We next investigated whether recombinant Sez6L2-MH functions as a cofactor for Factor I cleavage of C3b. FH and C4BP are known co-factors of FI towards C3b (

66

–

70

) and were used as positive controls. C3b is composed of the C3α’ chain and the C3β chain linked by disulfide bonds (see schematic in

Figure 5A

). With cofactor support, FI cuts C3b sequentially at site 1 (Arg

1303

-Ser

1304

), then site 2 (Arg

1320

-Ser

1321

) and finally site 3 (Arg

954

-Glu

955

; UniProt numbering of prepro-C3) (

68

). Cofactors can support efficient cleavage at one, two, or all three sites (

68

–

70

). For example, FH facilitates efficient cleavage at sites 1 and 2, but has very weak and slow cofactor function for site 3 [(

68

–

70

); and

Figure 5B

]. Incubation of C3b (1.5 µM) and FI (0.5 µM) with 1 µM FH or C4BP for 2 hours resulted in an almost complete loss of C3α’ and the appearance of two cleavage products: C3α’1 (visible by western blot with a C3d antibody and in the Coomassie stained gel) and C3α’2-(cut at site 2; visible in the Coomassie stained gel as a ~42 kDa band) (

Figure 5B

). A small amount of C3dg and C3c-C3a’1 also appeared in the FH sample, signaling some cleavage at site 3. FI incubated with C3b and increasing amounts of Sez6L2-MH (1 µM-8 µM) for two hours facilitated partial FI cleavage of the C3α’ chain to C3α’1 and C3α’2 in a dose-dependent manner. Sez6L2-MH facilitated cleavage of C3b at site 1 and less efficient cleavage of C3b at the second cleavage site generating both the larger C3α’2-site 1 band (~44 kDa) and the smaller C3α’2-site 2 band (~42 kDa). We also assayed Sez6L2-MH cofactor activity occurring at incubation times ranging from 15 minutes to 8 hours. 1.5 µM of Sez6L2 facilitated some FI cleavage of C3b at site 1 starting at 15 minutes. Longer incubation times yielded increasing amounts of C3b cut by FI at sites 1 and 2 (

Figure 5C

). With incubation times at four hours or longer, Sez6L2-MH also facilitated a small amount of cleavage at site 3, generating some C3dg and C3c-C3α’1. Incubation of C3b with Sez6L-MH alone did not result in any C3b cleavage products, indicating that FI is the active protease responsible for C3b cleavage in the presence of Sez6L2-MH (

Figure 5B

).

C3b and Factor I (FI) were incubated alone, with concentrations of Sez6L2-MH ranging from 1 to 8 µM, or with 1 µM Factor H (FH) or C4BP for two hours at 37°C. Then samples were analyzed by western blot using antibodies that recognize C3d, a region within the C3α chain [and highlighted by the black rectangle in the schematics in

]. Coomassie stained gels are also shown. Sez6L2-MH supports partial FI cleavage of C3b at sites 1 and 2 generating the cleavage products C3α’1 and C3α’2 in a concentration dependent manner. FH and C4BP (known co-factors of FI towards C3b) supported almost full cleavage of C3b at sites 1 and 2. FH also showed partial cleavage at site 3 generating some C3dg and C3c-C3α’1.

(C)

C3b and FI were incubated with 1.5 µM Sez6L2-MH for 0.25-8 hours and then were visualized by western blot and Coomassie stained gels. Sez6L2-MH facilitates more FI cleavage with increased time including some partial cleavage at site 3 to generating C3dg and C3c-C3α’1.

Some FI cofactors are specific for either C3b or C4b, while others work on both. Therefore, the FI cleavage assay was repeated with C4b. C4b is composed of three peptide chains—C4α’, C4β, and C4γ—attached by disulfide bonds. Cofactors aid FI to cut the C4α’ chain at two locations yielding C4d, C4α3, and C4α4 (see schematic in

Figure 6A

). C4b (1.5 µM) and FI (0.5 µM) were incubated alone, with 1 µM of C4BP, or with concentrations of Sez6L2-MH ranging from 1 to 8 µM for two hours. C4BP was able to facilitate almost complete cleavage of C4α’ to C4α3, C4α4, and C4d. No amount of Sez6L2-MH tested was able to promote any FI cleavage of C4b (

Figure 6B

). Longer incubation times up to eight hours also did not allow Sez6L2-MH to promote FI cleavage of C4b (

Figure 6C

). In summary, Sez6L2 is a cofactor for FI that facilitates partial cleavage of C3b, but not C4b.

(B)

C4b and FI were incubated alone, with concentrations of Sez6L2-MH ranging from 1 to 8 µM, or with 1 µM C4BP for two hours at 37°C. Then samples were then run and visualized on Coomassie stained gels. Incubation of C4b and FI with Sez6L2-MH did not result in the appearance of C4b cleavage products C4d, C4α3, or C4α4. On the other hand, C4BP (a known cofactor of FI for C4b cleavage) supported FI’s production of C4d, C4α3, and C4α4.

(C)

Sez6L2-MH does not support Factor I cleavage of C4b even with increased time. C4b and FI were incubated with 1.5 µM Sez6L2-MH for 0.25-8 hours and then visualized on Coomassie stained gels.

Sez6L2-MH Accelerates the Decay of C3 Convertases

Complement inhibitors that act at the level of C3 convertases, function not only as cofactors for FI, but they can also act as decay accelerating factors to irreversibly dissociate the catalytic subunit (Bb/C2b) from the non-catalytic subunit (C3b/C4b). MCP functions primarily as a cofactor and does not have decay accelerating activity. Alternatively, DAF was named for its decay accelerating activity and has no cofactor function. FH has both cofactor and decay accelerating activity (

36

). To investigate whether Sez6L2-MH has decay accelerating activity for the alternative pathway C3 convertase, we coated C3b on a 96 well plate and then added Factor B and Factor D to generate C3bBb bound to the plate. Sez6L2-MH or FH were added to the wells in increasing concentrations. The ability of Sez6L2-MH or FH to displace Bb from the bound C3bBb complex was assessed in an ELISA assay using an anti-FB antibody. The percent of FB remaining on the plate (normalized to buffer only control) was graphed against the concentrations of FH and Sez6L2-MH. Sez6L2-MH at lower concentrations (0.1 nM-60 nM) had no effect on the dissociation of Bb from the C3bBb convertase complex, while higher concentrations of Sez6L2 (600 nM-6 µM) significantly decreased the amount of FB on the plate by 25-72% in a dose dependent manner (

Figure 7A

). FH was effective at much lower concentrations, as 0.4 - 40 nM significantly decreased the amount of FB on the plate by 22-74%. Higher concentrations of FH (200 nM – 1.6µM) were also effective and reduced the convertase associated FB by just over 75% (a point at which the maximal decay activity appeared to plateau). The relative IC50 for FH was between 1-2 nM and the relative IC50 for Sez6L2-MH was ~1.2 µM.

Figure 7

Truncated Sez6L2 has decay accelerating activity for the alternative pathway C3 convertase but has only modest decay accelerating activity for the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase.

Alternative C3 convertase assay:

(A–C)

A 96 well plate coated with C3b was incubated with Factor B and Factor D to form the C3 convertase C3bBb, then incubated with Sez6L2-MH or FH at various concentrations ranging from 0-6000 nM (equivalent to 0-500 µg/mL) to assess their decay accelerating activity. Factor B remaining bound to the plate (as C3bBb) was detected using an anti-Factor B antibody ELISA in

and Bb released into the supernatant is shown

with Bb band densities quantified in

. For the western blot and quantification, Sez6L2-MH and FH concentrations are listed in both nM and µg/mL. Quantification of Bb band densities were normalized to the 0 nM control lanes. N=3 samples per group.

(D)

The alternative C3 convertase decay ELISA described above was repeated comparing 0, 1uM, and 5uM of Sez6L2-MH, H-DAF, FH, and BSA.

(E)

Classical C3 convertase assay: A plate coated with C4b was incubated with C2 and C1s-enzyme to form the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase C4b2b, then incubated with Sez6L2-MH, H-DAF at concentrations ranging from 0 to 7000 nM to assess their decay accelerating activity. C2 remaining bound to the plate (presumably as C4b2b) was detected using an anti-C2 antibody ELISA. For A, D, and E ELISAs: N=3 (1 experiment with 3 replicates; representative of 2-3 independent experiments). Statistics: one-way ANOVAS with Holms-Sidak multiple comparison’s tests to controls. *p < 0.05, **< 0.01.

Supernatants collected from the plate at the end of the incubation with Sez6L2-MH or FH were collected and analyzed by western blot with antibodies to Factor B. With increasing levels of Sez6L2-MH or FH, we found increasing levels of Bb (MW 70 KDa) in the supernatant, which mirror the deceasing amounts of Factor B bound to the ELISA plates (

Figures 7B, C

). We did not detect any full-length FB in the supernatants which shows that the decreasing plate-associated FB detected in the ELISA was mostly in the Bb form. We additionally compared the C3bBb decay activity of Sez6L2-MH and FH to that of H-DAF and a negative control protein, BSA at 0, 1, and 5 µM (

Figure 7D

). At 1µM, the decay activity of H-DAF and FH reduced the plate associated FB by 83% and 87% respectively, while 5 µM DAF reduced FB by 90.1%. Whereas, at 1 µM, Sez6L2-MH reduced plate associated FB by 44% and at 5 µM Sez6L2-MH reduced FB to 76% compared to the buffer only control and the BSA negative controls at 1 µm and 5 µM (p<0.001 for all). Taken together, these data show that soluble Sez6L2-MH exhibits decay accelerating activity for the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb, but requires higher concentrations than FH and H-DAF.

Next we tested whether Sez6L2-MH could accelerate the decay of the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase, C4b2b. A plate coated with C4b was incubated with C2 and C1s-enzyme to form the C3 convertase, C4b2b, then incubated with Sez6L2-MH or H-DAF at concentrations ranging from 0 to 7 µM to assess their decay accelerating activity. C2 remaining bound to the plate (presumably as C4b2b) was detected using an anti-C2 antibody ELISA (

Figure 7E

). H-DAF effectively removed bound C2b from the plate in a dose dependent manner with 7 µM H-DAF resulting in complete dissociation of C2b. Sez6L2-MH was also able to dissociate the C2b in a dose dependent manner with the maximal dose of 6 µM Sez6L2-MH reducing C2b by 43% (plate bound C2b with Sez6L2-MH = 57 ± 8% % vs 100 ± 4% % with buffer alone; p=0.002 Holm-Sidak MCT). Thus Sez6L2-MH has only modest decay accelerating activity for the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase.

Discussion

We have shown that Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2 are all novel complement regulators that inhibit C3b/iC3b opsonization by the classical and alternative pathways. Sez6 was the most effective inhibitor of the classical pathway and functioned at a level equivalent to H-DAF and better than MCP. It also provided strong protection against the alternative pathway. Sez6L2 was a moderate inhibitor for the classical pathway that performed at a level similar to MCP and Sez6L2 was perhaps the most protective family member against the alternative pathway. Sez6L was a weak inhibitor towards the classical pathway but also functioned similar to MCP against the alternative pathway. We additionally showed that a truncated and soluble version of Sez6L2 partially prevented hemolysis by the alternative pathway, but only modestly blocks hemolysis by the classical pathway. Sez6L2 does this by inhibiting C3 convertases. Specifically, Sez6L2 inhibits complement by accelerating the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb, but has only weak decay activity toward the classical pathway convertase, C4b2b. Sez6L2 also functions as a cofactor for Factor I to facilitate cleavage of C3b, but not C4b. While most of our data do not employ neuronal specific paradigms, we have used well established methods of complement activity in serum to ascertain novel Sez6 family functions that are still relevant to complement in the brain or other tissues.

Previous studies have shown that Sez6 family proteins control dendritic branching and synaptic density by unknown mechanisms (

13

,

15

,

16

,

24

). Additionally, genetic loss of the entire Sez6 family results in impaired motor coordination and motor learning, and impaired cognition (

13

–

16

). Sez6L2 proteins can be found throughout the somatodendritic compartment in some neuronal cell types like Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (

14

,

15

). However, we report here that Sez6L2 can also be localized to synapses as we found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This synaptic location is also in line with a proteomic screen on dissociated cortical neurons reported by Loh et al. that found Sez6L2 within the excitatory synaptic cleft (

71

). The synaptic and dendritic localization of Sez6L2 puts it in an ideal location to protect synapses and dendrites from complement-dependent pruning during development and may be a mechanism by which Sez6 proteins modulate synapse numbers and dendritic morphology. However, Sez6 proteins could also modulate complement activation levels affecting neurogenesis, neuronal migration, or immune reactions to various insults. Perhaps complement dysregulation explains the genetic association of the Sez6 family with multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including: autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder (

1

–

9

).

We found that both full-length and truncated versions of Sez6L2 were capable of inhibiting complement. This is likely important as the extracellular domains of all Sez6 family proteins can be cut near the transmembrane region by BACE enzymes (1 and 2) (

16

,

72

,

73

). This provides a means to remove the complement inhibitors from the cell surface making the cell vulnerable to complement opsonization and its downstream consequences. On the other hand, it also provides a mechanism to release soluble complement inhibitors that could be useful to nearby “self” surfaces or the CSF. Soluble Sez6 is elevated in the CSF of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression and inflammatory pain compared to controls (

74

,

75

). However, soluble Sez6 is decreased in the CSF in Alzheimer’s (

76

). Thus, altered shedding of the extracellular complement regulatory region of Sez6 proteins is likely connected and may have direct consequences on the development of neuropathology. Cells may also change their vulnerability to complement by expressing alternative short splice variants of Sez6 family members that do not contain a transmembrane anchor and the three tandem CCP domains that presumably mediate complement inhibition (

13

,

15

).

The truncated Sez6L2-MH purified protein was very useful in examining the specific mechanisms by which Sez6L2 inhibits complement at the level of the C3 convertases. However, we also found it was less effective than the positive controls used in our studies (FH, DAF, and C4BP). It is possible that the purification process led to partial deactivation of Sez6L2-MH, necessitating higher levels of Sez6L2-MH to achieve complement inhibition. It is also possible that the truncated version could be less active than the full-length transmembrane protein due to its inability to localize to areas of complement activation or to correctly orient the complement inhibitory domains for efficient inhibition. Naturally soluble serum regulators like FH and C4BP have multiple C3 binding sites or can oligomerize to enhance homing to areas of active complement deposition. They also have binding sites for other complement factors or “self” membranes that aid recruitment and correct orientation of the inhibitors. These properties may also help explain their superior activity compared to our recombinant, Sez6L2-MH. Furthermore, truncation of other complement inhibitors, like FH, CR1, MCP, or SUSD4 can result in reduced activity compared of the full-length proteins (

36

,

77

–

79

). For example, soluble MCP barely functions as a cofactor for the cleavage of erythrocyte-bound C3b, but it is an efficient cofactor in its full-length, cell-bound form (

79

).

The domain structure of the Sez6 family which contains five CCP domains (three of which are consecutive) initially prompted us to investigate the complement regulatory functions of Sez6 family members. Although proteins with multiple CCP domains are common to the complement pathway, there are many other proteins that contain CCP domains (even tandem CCP domains) that do not have complement inhibitory functions. Although the amino acid sequences of CCP domains vary considerably, complement regulatory proteins bind to C3b using a common binding platform on C3b with their 3-4 consecutive CCP domains in an extended orientation (

38

). Ojha et al. recently used AI-assisted computer learning along with significant functional annotation based on decades of experimental research on complement regulatory proteins to propose five short motifs that potentially confer complement inhibitory activity when conserved in a specific order across three tandem CCP domains (

29

). Using their web-based CoreDo program, we found Sez6L2 has the correct motif pattern for predicted complement regulatory activity (

29

). Thus, our results on Sez6L2 match their prediction. However, Sez6 and Sez6L do not have the correct five motif pattern; and yet, Sez6 was even more efficient at inhibiting C3b/iC3b opsonization by the classical pathway than Sez6L2. Interestingly, CSMD1, another brain expressed complement inhibitor associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and perhaps a distant cousin of the Sez6 family, was also one of only two experimentally validated complement inhibitors that did not fit the five-motif pattern identified and reported by Ojha et al. (

29

,

80

–

83

). As the core CCP motif pattern is somewhat different between Sez6L2 and Sez6, it is possible that there are unique features to their complement regulatory activity yet to be discovered.

Our study focused on C3 convertase inhibitory activities that have long been associated with CCP-domain containing complement regulators. We have assumed that much of the complement inhibitory activity of Sez6 family proteins comes from the sub-region with three adjacent CCP domains. However, CUB domains are also known to mediate multiple protein-protein interactions within the complement pathway, including the binding of C1r/C1s to C1q (

84

,

85

). Therefore, the CUB domains of Sez6 proteins may mediate more interactions with complement factors in order to boost, broaden, or limit their impact on the complement pathways. Interestingly, different splice variants of the Sez6 family yield proteins with either two or three CUB domains. The Sez6L variant we tested contained three CUB domains and was the least effective family member at blocking C3 deposition by the classical pathway. In contrast, the variants of Sez6 and Sez6L2 we tested had only two CUB domains and were much more effective at blocking the classical pathway. Future studies will investigate whether the C3 convertase inhibitory activities can be isolated to the region of Sez6 proteins containing three adjacent CCP domains and will additionally seek to determine whether the CUB domains positively or negatively modulate the complement inhibitory activity of the Sez6 family members.

These studies were motivated by our overarching goal to better understand the identity and role of complement regulatory proteins in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Yet, the complement inhibitory activity of the Sez6 family may also explain their role in cancer. Increased expression of Sez6 family members has been linked to increased tumor growth and a poor prognosis in various cancers (

17

–

23

). The role of complement in tumorigenesis is complex as it may exacerbate or inhibit tumor growth depending on the immune response and inflammatory environment. However, increased expression of complement regulatory proteins has been repeatedly shown to limit innate immune surveillance and cytotoxicity by the complement system and provide resistance to antibody based immunotherapies (

86

). Increased expression of complement regulators may also dampen the B and T cell immune response to tumor cells after chemotherapy due to complement/immune cell crosstalk mediated

via

CR2 (

86

,

87

). Thus complement resistance not only influences the course of the disease but also limits therapeutic options. Testing for increased Sez6 family expression and employing strategies to block their complement inhibitory function alongside other therapeutic approaches may be necessary as it has been against tumors overexpressing other complement regulators like MCP, DAF, FH, or CD59.

#### SEZ6L - Article 4: Seizure protein 6 and its homolog seizure 6-like protein are physiological substrates of BACE1 in neurons
<Date>: 2016-10-5
<PMCID>: 5053352
<Full Text Content>:
Background

The β-secretase BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme) is a key drug target in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [

1

]. BACE1 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and thus catalyzes the first step in generation of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) [

2

–

5

], which has a critical role in AD pathogenesis [

6

]. BACE1 is highly expressed in the nervous system and contributes to additional physiological processes besides its role in AD, e.g. through neuregulin-1 cleavage in myelination and CHL1 cleavage in axon targeting [

7

–

12

]. Moreover, several phenotypic changes were described in BACE1-/- mice, such as epileptic seizures, schizophrenic symptoms, increased mortality and altered insulin metabolism, but most of the BACE1 substrates contributing to these phenotypes still need to be determined [

13

]. Their identification and validation would also allow the estimation of potential liabilities of BACE inhibitors in AD clinical trials and the use of BACE1 substrate cleavage products, in addition to Aβ, as possible companion diagnostics to monitor BACE1 inhibition in animals and patients.

More than 40 substrate candidates for BACE1 were identified in recent proteomic studies in murine neurons or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but only a few of them have been validated to date with functional or in vitro assays, including L1, CHL1, ENPP5 and PTPRN2 [

12

,

14

–

16

].

The three members of the seizure protein 6 (SEZ6) family, namely SEZ6, SEZ6-like (SEZ6L) and SEZ6-like 2 (SEZ6L2) have been identified as candidate BACE1 substrates in different studies [

15

,

17

], but have not yet been validated in detail. The SEZ6 family controls synaptic connectivity and motor coordination in mice [

18

,

19

], but little is known about the functions of these proteins at the molecular level. How BACE1-cleavage influences the function of SEZ6 and SEZ6L has not been investigated so far.

Interestingly, several of the identified BACE1 substrate candidates were also found to be cleaved by other proteases. As a result, substrate cleavage was only partly blocked upon BACE1 inhibition or BACE1-deficiency [

14

,

15

], limiting the use of these substrates or their cleavage products as potential biomarkers to monitor BACE1 inhibition in vivo. In contrast, the two type I membrane proteins SEZ6 and its homolog SEZ6L appeared to be almost exclusively cleaved by BACE1 in neurons [

15

], making them potential biomarkers for BACE activity in vivo. The third family member, SEZ6L2, appeared to be mostly cleaved by proteases other than BACE1 [

15

,

17

]. After the proteomic identification of SEZ6 as a BACE1 substrate candidate, SEZ6 was also shown to undergo reduced cleavage in BACE1-/- mouse brains [

15

]. However, the proteomic data for SEZ6L have not been validated by other methods and another proteomic study using pancreatic cells and tissue failed to confirm SEZ6L as a BACE1 substrate. Instead, that study demonstrated that SEZ6L is cleaved by the BACE1-homolog BACE2 in pancreas [

17

].

To resolve whether SEZ6 and SEZ6L are

bona fide

BACE1 substrates in brain, we generated monoclonal antibodies against both proteins and validated SEZ6 and SEZ6L as BACE1 substrates in murine neurons and brain. Additionally, SEZ6 and SEZ6L levels at the neuronal surface were controlled by BACE1, as demonstrated by cell surface biotinylation. Finally, we used a whole proteome analysis of CSF from BACE-deficient mice and found that the soluble ectodomains of SEZ6 and SEZ6L in CSF were most strongly reduced among all BACE1 substrates identified, suggesting their use as potential biomarkers in CSF to monitor BACE1 activity in mice.

Mouse strains

The following mice were used in this study: wild type (WT) C57BL/6NCrl (Charles River), BACE1-/- (Jackson Laboratory, strain B6.129- Bace1tm1Pcw/J, BACE1 KO), SEZ6-/- (SEZ6 KO) [

18

], SEZ6 family triple knockout (TKO) mice lacking SEZ6, SEZ6L and SEZ6L2 [

19

] and SEZ6L2-/- (SEZ6L2 KO, bred from SEZ6 family TKO [

19

]). For the CSF experiments the following mice were used: WT, single BACE1-/- (BACE1 KO), single BACE2-/- (BACE2 KO), double BACE1-/- BACE2-/- (BACE DKO) knockout mice [

20

]. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background and were maintained on a 12/12 h light-dark cycle with food and water

ad libitum

.

Antibody production in rat

Monoclonal antibodies against murine SEZ6 (clone 14E5, IgG1) and murine SEZ6L (clone 21D9, IgG2a) were generated using standard procedures [

21

]. Briefly, a cDNA (HIS-mmSEZ6-HIS) was generated encoding murine (

mus musculus

) SEZ6 ectodomain (mmSEZ6, aa: 29-869, lacking the endogenous signal peptide) with an N- and C-terminal HIS tag, fused to an N-terminal CD5 signal peptide. The CD5 signal peptide allows for efficient secretion of the recombinant protein and is removed upon expression by signal peptidase, yielding HIS-mmSEZ6-HIS. The other cDNA (mmSEZ6L-1xStrepII) encoded murine SEZ6L ectodomain with its endogenous signal peptide (mmSEZ6L, aa: 1-812) and a C-terminal 1xStrepII tag. cDNA constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells and recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatant and used for immunization of rats.

Mus musculus

SEZ6, transcript variant 1 (Uniprot Q7TSK2-1) without signal peptide in pcDNA3.1 vector using Gibson assembly protocol as previously described [

14

]. The signal peptide of SEZ6 was replaced by the CD5 signal peptide, followed by a short tag resulting from sequence and ligase independent cloning (SLIC) [

22

], and an HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). A FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was cloned to the C terminus of the protein. pcDNA3.1/HA-SLIC-Flag-empty was used as control. pcDNA3.1/Flag-V5-hSEZ6-HA was generated cloning full-length

Homo sapiens

SEZ6, transcript variant 1 (Uniprot Q53EL9-1) into pcDNA3.1 vector. Following the endogenous signaling peptide, a Flag and V5 (PIPNPLLGLDST) tag were inserted, separated by a 10 amino acid glycine/serine linker sequence. An HA tag was cloned to the C terminus of the protein.

Transfection and stable line generation

HEK293T stably expressing pcDNA3.1/HA-SLIC-Flag-mmSEZ6 or pcDNA3.1/HA- SLIC-Flag-empty as control were generated and cultured as previously described [

14

]. Cells were seeded in plates coated with Poly-D-lysine (Sigma, P6407). After 24 h medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with either C3, DAPT or DMSO as control. Collection of supernatants and cell lysates (described below) was done after 24 h. MIN6 were cultured in the same conditions, supplementing the medium with 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (all from Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 10 nM of BACE1, BACE2 and respective control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13778-150), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours post transfection, medium was replaced and cells were incubated for 24 h before collection of supernatants and cell lysis.

For drug inhibition studies, MIN6 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Flag-V5-hSEZ6-HA as described above. Stable cell lines were generated using Geneticin (Gibco) selection pressure (800 μg/ml). MIN6 cells stably expressing Flag-V5-SEZ6 were seeded at a concentration of 300,000 cells/well in Falcon 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning, 353047). After 72 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing BACE inhibitors. Cells were treated with a nonselective BACE inhibitor (Compound A: (4aR,6R,8aS)-8a-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)-4a,5,6,8-tetrahydro-4H-pyrano[3,4-d] [

], and 2 BACE1-selective inhibitors (Compound B: (5S)-2-amino-5-(2,6-diethyl-4-pyridyl)-3-methyl-5-(3-pyrimidin-5-ylphenyl)imidazol-4-one (AZD3839) [

] or Compound C: (5S)-2-amino-5-(2,6-diethyl-4-pyridyl)-3-methyl-5-(3-pyrimidin-5-ylphenyl)imidazol-4-one [

25

]. After 24 h of drug incubation, medium was removed, centrifuged to remove floating cells/cell debris (4000xg, 10 min), and analyzed for soluble shed Flag-V5-hSEZ6 as described below. For evaluation of endogenous SEZ6L shedding, wild-type MIN6 cells were seeded as above, and medium was replaced with drug-containing Opti-MEM (Gibco). After 24 h of drug exposure, Opti-MEM was removed and centrifuged to remove cell debris.

Cellular Aβ assay

Cellular activity was assessed using the human SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cell line expressing the wild-type amyloid precursor protein (hAPP695). BACE inhibitors described above were diluted and added to the cells, incubated for 18 h, and then measurements of Aβ42 were taken. Aβ42 was measured by a sandwich αlisa assay using biotinylated antibody (AbN/25) attached to streptavidin-coated beads and antibody (cAb42/26) conjugated acceptor beads. In the presence of Aβ42, the beads come into close proximity. The excitation of the donor beads provokes the release of singlet oxygen molecules that triggers a cascade of energy transfer in the acceptor beads, resulting in light emission. Aβ42 was quantified on an EnVision Multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with excitation at 650 nm and emission at 615 nm.

Enzymatic BACE1 and BACE2 assay

Primary BACE1 and BACE2 enzymatic activity was assessed by a FRET assay using an amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived 13 amino acids peptide contain the “Swedish” Lys-Met/Asn-Leu mutation of the APP β-secretase cleavage site as a substrate (Bachem, M-2465) and soluble BACE1(1 − 454) (Aurigene, Custom made) or soluble BACE2 (Enzo, BML-SE550). The APP peptide substrate (Mca-SEVNLDAEFRL(Dnp)RR-NH

2

) contains two fluorophores: 1) (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl) acetic acid (Mca), a fluorescent donor with excitation wavelength at 320 nm and emission at 405 nm and, 2) 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp), a proprietary quencher acceptor. An increase in fluorescence is linearly related to the rate of proteolysis. BACE1 or BACE2 were incubated with substrate and the inhibitor for 120 min in a 384-well plate. The amount of proteolysis is measured by fluorescence measurement in the Fluoroskan microplate fluorometer (Thermo Scientific). For the low control, no enzyme was added to the reaction mixture.

Mesoscale (MSD) detection of sFlag-V5-SEZ6 and sSEZ6L

Detection of Flag-V5-SEZ6 and SEZ6L was done in Mesoscale Discovery MULTI-ARRAY 96-well plates (L15XA-3 or L15XB-3 respectively). sFlag-V5-SEZ6 was quantified using anti-DYKDDDDK Tag capture antibody (L5, Biolegend, 10 μg/ml), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 Epitope Tag detection antibody (R960-25, ThermoFisher, 1:20000 dilution) and SULFO-TAG labeled Protein A (1:4000 dilution) for anti-mouse quantification. SEZ6L was quantified by coating 30 μl of Opti-MEM medium diluted 1:25 in PBS to MSD High Bind plates overnight at 4 °C, followed by detection with 25 μl of R&D System anti-SEZ6L (AF4804, 2 μg/ml) and SULFO-TAG labeled Anti-Sheep antibody (MSD, R32AI-1, 1 μg/ml). For both assays, blocking and antibody dilutions were done in 0.1 % Blocker™ Casein (ThermoFisher) in PBS. Detection was done using 2× concentration of Read Buffer T (MSD, R92TC-1). Data were transformed to 0–100 % activity based on low controls (2.5 μM nonselective BACE inhibitor with nM potency) and high controls (0.02 % DMSO) within the same plate. IC50s were calculated in Graphpad Prism using the four parameter variable slope nonlinear fit model. All curves are based on biological replicates with at least two technical replicates.

Isolation of primary neurons

Neurons from WT mice were isolated at E15/E16 and cultured as described previously [

26

]. After 5 days in vitro (DIV), neurons were washed with PBS and medium was replaced with fresh neurobasal supplemented with C3 or DMSO as control. After 48 h (7 DIV), supernatants from neurons were collected and cells were lysed.

Cell lysate preparation

Supernatants from neurons, HEK293T and MIN6 cells were collected and cells were lysed as described previously [

14

]. Protein concentrations were quantified with an BCA assay (Uptima Interchim, UP95425) and 15–20 μg of total neuronal lysate, 8–10 μg of HEK293T lysate and 15–20 μg of MIN6 lysate were used for Western Blot analysis.

Brain fractionation

Brains were isolated from P7 BACE1 KO mice and WT littermates. SEZ6 KO, SEZ6L2 KO and SEZ6 TKO and WT brains were collected from 4 to 5 month old male mice. All brains were processed as previously described [

15

]. Protein concentrations were quantified with an BCA assay (Uptima Interchim, UP95425) and 15–20 μg of total protein were used for Western Blot analysis.

Murine CSF sampling

CSF was extracted from single BACE1 KO, BACE2 KO, BACE DKO mice and WT controls according to a previously described protocol [

27

]. CSF was put into a 0.5 ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf), centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g, and transferred to a fresh tube and frozen at −80 °C. For mass spectrometric analysis 7 WT and 7 BACE DKO were sampled and 5 μl of each CSF sample was used. Immunoblots for the analysis of murine CSF were performed using 5 or 4 μl of CSF.

Western blot analysis

Samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer. For the detection of SEZ6L, Laemmli buffer without disulfide bridge reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol was used. Samples were separated on 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Schägger gels were used for the detection of C-terminal fragments (16.5 % separation gel, 10 % spacer gel [

28

]). PVDF membranes (Millipore) were incubated with primary antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, membranes were developed with ECL prime (GE Healthcare, RPN2232V1).

Deglycosylation assay

40 μg of neuronal lysate were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, New England Biolabs, P0702), or Peptide-

N

-Glycosidase (PNGase F, New England Biolabs, P0704) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For SEZ6L, non-reducing conditions were used (denaturation buffer was with 5 % SDS but no DTT). Afterwards, the samples were separated on 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Surface biotinylation

At 7 DIV, neurons were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (ThermoFisher, 21217) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quenching was done with ammonium chloride (50 mM) and BSA (1 %) in PBS and lysis with SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS). RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton, 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS) was used to dilute the samples. After sonication, protein concentrations were quantified and 80 μg of total lysate were incubated with 25 μl of High Capacity Streptavidin Agarose Resin (ThermoFisher, 20361), mixed overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed in RIPA buffer and bound proteins were eluted by boiling at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 3 mM biotin. Eluted proteins were separated on 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotting was performed.

BACE1 in vitro digestion and mass spectrometric cleavage site determination

The murine SEZ6 peptide AASLDGFYNGRSLDVAKAPAASSAL (PSL Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH, Germany) was resuspended in LC-MS grade water (Chromasolv, Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and 40 μg of peptide were used to determine the cleavage site. Peptides were incubated with recombinant BACE1 with or without C3 inhibitor in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.4 from 4 to 16 h as previously described [

29

].

Samples from the peptide cleavage assay were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. An amount of 500 fmol with respect to the starting material of the synthetic peptide was injected. Samples were separated on a nanoLC system (EASY-nLC 1000, Proxeon – part of Thermo Scientific, US; PRSO-V1 column oven: Sonation, Germany) using an in-house packed C18 column (30 cm × 75 μm ID, ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) with a binary gradient of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) containing 0.1 % formic acid at 50 °C column temperature and a flow of 250 nl/min (0 min, 8 % B; 25:00 min, 35 % B; 30:00 min, 95 % B; 40:00 min, 95 % B). The nanoLC was coupled online via a nanospray flex ion source (Proxeon – part of Thermo Scientific, US) to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, US). The five most intense ions exceeding an intensity of 1.0 × 10

4

were chosen for collision induced dissociation. The dynamic exclusion was reduced to 1 s and the m/z values of the proposed cleavage products were put on an inclusion list to get high quality MS/MS spectra.

MS raw data of the peptide cleavage assay were used to check for m/z values of possible cleavage products. Quantification was done by calculating the area under the curve of cleavage products using extracted ion chromatograms. Peak areas of the synthetic peptide incubated with BACE1 were compared with the control incubations of BACE1 and C3 as well as without BACE1. The identity of cleavage products was verified by a database search against the sequence of the synthetic peptide with Maxquant [

30

]. Non-specific cleavage was applied to identify cleavage products by tandem MS spectra.

Mass spectrometric analysis of CSF samples

Seven WT and seven BACE DKO CSF samples were used for mass spectrometric analysis. A volume of 5 μL of CSF per sample was subjected to proteolytic digestion in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). Disulfide bonds were reduced by addition of 2 μL 10 mM dithiothreitol (Biomol, Germany). Cysteine residues were alkylated by addition of 2 μL 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). Proteolytic digestion was performed by consecutive digestion with LysC (0.1 μg; 4 h) and trypsin (0.1 μg; 16 h) at room temperature (Promega, Germany).

Samples were acidified by adding 4 μL of 8 % formic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and 150 μL of 0.1 % formic acid (Sigma Aldrich Germany). Precipitated deoxycholate was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 20 °C. Proteolytic peptides were desalted by stop and go extraction (STAGE) with C18 tips [

31

], dried by vacuum and dissolved in 20 μL 0.1 % formic acid.

Samples were analyzed with the same LC-MS/MS method as described for the BACE1 in vitro digestion assay with a longer gradient (0 min, 2 % B; 3:30 min, 5 % B; 137:30 min, 25 % B; 168:30 min, 35 % B; 182:30 min, 60 % B; 185 min, 95 % B; 200 min, 95 % B).

Full MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000. The top ten peptide ions exceeding an intensity of 1.5 × 10

4

were chosen for collision induced dissociation. Fragment ion spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17,500. A dynamic exclusion of 120 s was used for peptide fragmentation.

MS data analysis of CSF samples

The data were analyzed with Maxquant software (maxquant.org, Max-Planck Institute Munich) version 1.5.3.12 [

30

]. The MS data were searched against a reviewed canonical fasta database of

Mus musculus

from UniProt (download: January 26th 2016, 16758 entries). Trypsin was defined as protease. Two missed cleavages were allowed for the database search. The option first search was used to recalibrate the peptide masses within a window of 20 ppm. For the main search, peptide and peptide fragment mass tolerances were set to 4.5 and 20 ppm, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was defined as static modification. Acetylation of the protein N-term as well as oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. False discovery rate for both peptides and proteins was adjusted to less than 1 % using a target and decoy approach (concatenated forward/reverse database). Only unique peptides were used for quantification. Label-free quantification (LFQ) of proteins required at least two ratio counts of unique peptides.

The LFQ intensity values were log2 transformed and a two-sided Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate the significance of proteins with changed abundance between KO and WT animals. A

p

-value less than 5 % was set as significance threshold.

Statistical tests

Statistical differences for Western Blot experiments were determined using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA, USA). In Fig.

7

, one-way ANOVA followed by two-tailed Student’s t-Test, was used for Western Blot quantification. Graphs show mean ± SEM.

Results

Validation of new monoclonal antibodies against SEZ6 and SEZ6L

To validate SEZ6 and SEZ6L as BACE1 substrates, rat monoclonal antibodies against both proteins were generated. They were first tested in immunoblots using membrane fractions from mouse brains. As a control, the third family member, SEZ6L2, was also analyzed, using a commercial antibody. To ensure the specificity of the immunoblot signals, brains from wild type (WT) as well as from SEZ6-/- (SEZ6 KO) or SEZ6L2-/- (SEZ6L2 KO) mice were used. As SEZ6L-/- mouse brains were not available, brains from mice lacking all three SEZ6 family members (SEZ6-/-, SEZ6L-/-, SEZ6L2-/-; triple knock-out, TKO [

16

]) were used instead.

In WT brains the SEZ6 antibody detected a major band at 170 kDa and a band of minor intensity at 150 kDa (Fig.

1a

). Importantly, both bands were absent in SEZ6 KO and TKO brains, but were clearly visible in SEZ6L2 KO brains, demonstrating the specificity of the SEZ6 antibody. Because SEZ6 has 10 predicted N-glycosylation sites [

32

], we next determined whether the two SEZ6 bands differ in their extent of glycosylation. In order to detect both the major and the minor band more intensively, a SEZ6 polyclonal antibody was used. Endogenous SEZ6 from neuronal lysates was deglycosylated in vitro using peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF), which removes all N-linked sugars, or endoglycosidase H (EndoH), which only removes high-mannose sugars but not complex glycosylated sugars. PNGaseF induced a band shift and lowered the apparent molecular weight of both SEZ6 bands to 155 and 135 kDa, respectively (Fig.

1b

). This demonstrates that SEZ6 is N-glycosylated. However, the fact that still two distinct SEZ6 bands – and not just one - were visible demonstrates that both protein forms must differ by an additional post-translational modification other than N-glycosylation. This is likely to be O-glycosylation as SEZ6 was found to be O-glycosylated in a proteomic study identifying O-glycosylated proteins [

33

]. Similar to PNGaseF, EndoH induced a band shift of the 150 kDa band, but did not induce a major shift of the 170 kDa band (Fig.

1b

). This reveals that the 170 kDa band contains complex sugars (referred to as mature SEZ6), whereas the 150 kDa band (referred to as immature SEZ6), contains only high-mannose sugars.

Immunohistochemistry of TKO and WT brains using antibody against SEZ6 (

c

) or SEZ6L (

d

)

The SEZ6L antibody detected one major band at 160 kDa and a very weak band at 130 kDa (Fig.

1a

). Both bands were not detected in the SEZ6 TKO samples, while they showed unchanged intensity in WT, SEZ6 KO and SEZ6L2 KO brains, thus confirming the specificity of the antibody for SEZ6L. Similar to SEZ6, the major SEZ6L band at 160 kDa was complex N-glycosylated. The glycosylation was removed with PNGaseF, but not with EndoH (Fig.

1b

). The 130 kDa band of SEZ6L was not consistently detected in the deglycosylation experiments, but may represent the immature form, similar to SEZ6.

As a control, SEZ6L2 expression was detected in WT and SEZ6 KO brains, but was absent in SEZ6L2 KO and SEZ6 TKO brains (Fig.

1a

). Notably, in brains deficient in SEZ6 or SEZ6L2, levels of the other family members were not significantly altered (Fig.

1a

), revealing that there are no compensatory changes in protein levels at least for deficiency of SEZ6 and SEZ6L2.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that SEZ6 and SEZ6L are N-glycosylated proteins and that the newly generated antibodies specifically detect endogenous SEZ6 and SEZ6L.

In WT adult mouse brains SEZ6 protein was localized to a number of brain regions including the neocortex and hippocampus (Fig.

1c

), with particularly strong immunoreactivity in the striatum and olfactory tubercle (not shown). In the cortex SEZ6 was localized to neuronal cell bodies and processes, predominantly in layers V and VI (Fig.

1c

). In the hippocampus, SEZ6 was localized to CA1 pyramidal neuron cell bodies and dendrites, CA2 and a subset of CA3 neurons, and sparsely labeled neurons in the dentate gyrus which resemble interneurons.

SEZ6 immunostaining was completely absent in SEZ6 TKO brain sections (Fig.

1c

) and in SEZ6 KO brain sections (data not shown).

Similarly, SEZ6L immunoreactivity (Fig.

1d

) appeared strong in the neocortex and hippocampus, and protein localization in these areas was consistent with SEZ6L mRNA expression in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas [

34

]. SEZ6L localized to pyramidal neurons throughout the cortex, particularly the apical dendrites (Fig.

1d

), and appeared relatively lower in layer IV and VI. All regions of the hippocampus displayed immunoreactivity for SEZ6L (Fig.

1d

) although staining was less prominent in neuronal soma than the SEZ6 staining (Fig.

1c

). SEZ6L staining was observed in other brain regions including the cerebellum and septal nuclei (data not shown). SEZL6 immunostaining was completely absent in SEZ6 TKO brain sections (Fig.

1d

).

Taken together, the newly generated antibodies specifically detect endogenous SEZ6 and SEZ6L by immunohistochemistry as well as Western Blot.

BACE1 cleavage of SEZ6 and SEZ6L in primary neurons and mouse brain

As a result of BACE1 cleavage, the soluble ectodomains of SEZ6 and SEZ6L (sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L) should be shed into the conditioned medium of primary neurons and into the extracellular space in mouse brains (Fig.

2a

). However, when BACE1 is inhibited or deleted, sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L might be absent or strongly reduced. In fact, treatment of primary neurons with the established BACE1 inhibitor C3 (also known as BACE1 inhibitor IV) [

35

] strongly reduced sSEZ6L levels compared to the control treatment with a concomitant moderate increase of full-length SEZ6L levels in the cell lysate (Fig.

2b

). Likewise, in P7 BACE1 KO mouse brains sSEZ6L was strongly reduced in the diethylamine soluble DEA brain fraction, while full-length SEZ6L was increased in the membrane fraction (Fig.

2c

). In agreement with our previous study on SEZ6 [

15

], similar results were obtained for sSEZ6 and full-length SEZ6 both in C3-treated neurons and in BACE1 KO mouse brains (Fig.

2b

and

c

). Taken together, these results reveal that ectodomain shedding of sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L requires BACE1 activity both in primary neurons and in mouse brains.

BACE1 cleavage of SEZ6 and SEZ6L in pancreatic MIN6 cells

A previous proteomic study showed that SEZ6L was cleaved by BACE2, but not by BACE1 in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 [

17

], which is different from our findings in neurons and brain. SEZ6 was not detected in that study. To investigate whether the same differences can be observed for SEZ6, we used the same cell line MIN6 and knocked-down BACE1 or BACE2 with siRNAs (Fig.

3a

). As a control, cleavage of SEZ6L was also monitored. In agreement with the previous study [

17

], sSEZ6L was reduced upon knock-down of BACE2, but not of BACE1. Interestingly, sSEZ6 was also not reduced upon knock-down of BACE1, but mildly reduced upon knock-down of BACE2. This shows that both SEZ6 and SEZ6L are not substrates for BACE1 in the pancreatic cell line. Full-length SEZ6 and SEZ6L levels were increased upon BACE2 knock-down, in line with the reduced cleavage of both proteins (Fig.

3a

). Taken together, this demonstrates that both SEZ6 and SEZ6L are cleaved by different proteases in a tissue-specific manner. One possible scenario might be that the tissue-specificity reflects the relative amounts of BACE1 and BACE2 in different tissues. For example, BACE1 – which was the major SEZ6 and SEZ6L protease in neurons – was found to be expressed at higher levels in neurons compared to MIN6 cells (Additional file

1

: Figure S1). The opposite was seen for BACE2, which was the primary protease cleaving SEZ6 and SEZ6L in MIN6 cells. This tissue- specificity is reminiscent of two other BACE1 substrates, APP and L1, which are mostly cleaved by BACE1 in neurons, but by ADAM10 in non-neuronal cells [

15

,

36

–

39

].

As a control, cells were treated with non-silencing control siRNA (siCon). Densitometric quantitations of the Western blots are shown, (*;

b

BACE1 (

) and BACE2 (

blue lines

) activity were quantified in enzymatic (

solid lines

) and cellular (

dotted lines

) models after pharmacological inhibition with nonselective (inhibiting both BACE1 and BACE2, compounds B and C) and BACE1-selective inhibitors (compound A). Soluble Aβ42 as well as sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L were detected in the supernatant of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) or in the MIN6 respectively, as indicated. Data were standardized to low and high controls within each assay. Data represent biological duplicates with two or more technical replicates

The cleavage of SEZ6 and SEZ6L in MIN6 cells by BACE2, but not BACE1, was further evaluated using nonselective (inhibiting both BACE1 and BACE2) and BACE1-selective pharmacological inhibitors by assessing shedding of SEZ6 and SEZ6L in MIN6 cells. Because SEZ6 is expressed at low levels in MIN6 cells (Additional file

1

: Figure S1), human SEZ6 tagged with an N-terminal Flag- and V5-tag (Flag-V6-hSEZ6) was mildly overexpressed in MIN6 cells. To validate the efficacy of BACE1 inhibition, Aβ42 (a BACE cleavage product of APP) was measured in the SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cell model, and sFlag-V5-hSEZ6 and endogenous sSEZ6L in MIN6 cells. IC50s for the released substrate cleavage products (sFlag-V5-SEZ6 sSEZ6L) were compared with IC50s determined in enzymatic BACE1 and BACE2 assays. Cleavage of Aβ42 and sFlag-V5-SEZ6 and sSEZ6L were similar after addition of nonselective BACE inhibitor A and was consistent with equipotent inhibition of BACE1 and BACE2 in enzymatic assays. However, cleavage of sFlag-V5-SEZ6 and sSEZ6L was less impacted than Aβ42 upon inhibition with BACE1-selective inhibitors (B and C) and followed the enzymatic inhibition curves of BACE2 rather than BACE1 (Fig.

3b

). This confirms the findings in Fig.

3a

and demonstrates that in MIN6 cells SEZ6 and SEZ6L are predominantly cleaved by BACE2, but not by BACE1.

BACE1 inhibition increases neuronal cell surface levels of SEZ6 and SEZ6L

The deglycosylation experiment (Fig.

1b

) had revealed that mature SEZ6 and SEZ6L carry complex N-linked sugars and are resistant to EndoH treatment. Complex sugars are added as proteins move through the Golgi apparatus. Thus, the mature forms of SEZ6 and SEZ6L are likely to be located in late compartments of the secretory pathway or at the plasma membrane. Indeed, using cell surface biotinylation the mature, but not the immature forms of both proteins were detected at the cell surface of primary neurons (Fig.

4

). Treatment with the BACE inhibitor C3 increased full-length, mature SEZ6 and SEZ6L in whole cell lysates (Fig.

2b

) and also at the cell surface (Fig.

4

). As a control, surface levels of the LDL-receptor (LDLR), which is a substrate of ADAM10, but not of BACE1 [

38

], were not altered upon BACE inhibition. To demonstrate the specificity of the surface biotinylation, β-actin was detected in whole lysates, but strongly reduced in the pull-down of the biotinylated cell surface proteins (Fig.

4

), as expected for a cytoplasmic protein. Taken together, BACE1 activity negatively controls the levels of SEZ6 and SEZ6L at the neuronal cell surface and in whole lysates.

Fig. 4

BACE1 controls neuronal cell surface levels of SEZ6 and SEZ6L. Primary, murine neurons were treated with the BACE inhibitor C3 or DMSO as a control. Proteins at the surface were labeled with biotin and enriched using streptavidin pull-down. Biotinylated SEZ6 and SEZ6L were detected by immunoblot. As a control, both proteins were also detected in whole cell lysates. Note, that only the mature 170 kDa form of SEZ6 was biotinylated at the cell surface. As a control, the ADAM10 substrate LDL receptor (LDLR) did not show a change in surface levels upon C3-treatment. As a further control, the cytosolic protein actin was only detected in whole lysates, but not among the surface biotinylated proteins

BACE1 cleaves SEZ6 within its juxtamembrane domain

Next, we determined the cleavage site of BACE1 within the juxtamembrane domain of SEZ6 and compared it to the previously identified cleavage site within its homolog SEZ6L [

15

]. In the previous proteomic study which identified SEZ6 as a BACE1 substrate candidate, several tryptic peptides of the secreted SEZ6 ectodomain were identified. The most C-terminal of these peptides encompassed amino acids 894 to 904 (AASLDGFYNGR) of murine SEZ6 (Fig.

5a

). This was a tryptic peptide ending with arginine (R), but BACE1 preferentially cleaves C-terminally to leucine or other hydrophobic amino acids [

40

]. Thus, the BACE1 cleavage site is likely to be located between this tryptic peptide and the transmembrane domain (start: leucine 923). To determine this site precisely, an in vitro peptide assay was used. The 25 amino acid peptide AASLDGFYNGRSLDVAKAPAASSAL (Fig.

5a

, amino acids 894 to 918), comprising the tryptic peptide and ending shortly before the transmembrane domain, was incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant BACE1 with or without the BACE1 inhibitor C3 (Fig.

5b

). Full-length peptide and cleavage fragments were separated by nano liquid chromatography and analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry (nanoLC/MS). The non-cleaved, full-length peptide eluted from the nLC column at ~ 22 min (Fig.

5b

). The correct sequence was verified by MS/MS-based fragmentation (Fig.

5c

). Upon addition of BACE1, the full-length peptide levels were decreased in the chromatogram and two additional peptides with elution times of ~16 and ~21 min were detected (Fig.

5b

). Addition of C3 inhibited the production of both peptides, demonstrating that they are BACE1 cleavage products of the full-length peptide. The two peptides were identified as AASLDGFYNGRSL (N-terminal cleavage product, Fig.

5d

) and DVAKAPAASSAL (C-terminal cleavage product 2, Fig.

5e

) by fragment spectra. Thus, we conclude that the BACE1 cleavage site in SEZ6 is the peptide bond between leucine906 and aspartate907 (Fig.

5a

). Interestingly, this site comprises the same amino acids in the P1 and P1’ position (L-D) as Swedish mutant APP (Fig.

5a

), which is very efficiently cleaved by BACE1 [

4

]. The previously identified cleavage site in SEZ6L [

15

] is not identical, but similar to SEZ6, as it also has a hydrophobic amino acid in the P1 and a negatively charged amino acid in the P1’ position (Fig.

5a

). Moreover, SEZ6 and SEZ6L are both cleaved at a similar distance from the transmembrane domain, i.e. 16 and 14 amino acids for SEZ6 and SEZ6L, respectively (Fig.

5a

).

SEZ6 is a substrate for γ-secretase

After initial BACE1 cleavage, the resulting C-terminal, membrane-bound protein fragments of several membrane proteins, including APP and SEZ6L [

17

], are further processed within their transmembrane domains by γ-secretase, in a process referred to as regulated intramembrane proteolysis [

41

] (for schematic overview see Fig.

2a

). The accumulation of C-terminal fragments upon pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase with DAPT can be used to identify γ-secretase substrates [

42

]. To examine if SEZ6 is also cleaved by γ-secretase, we generated a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cell line stably expressing murine SEZ6. Due to the lack of an antibody against the SEZ6 C-terminus, the full-length SEZ6 construct was tagged with an N-terminal HA and a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. The full-length SEZ6 in the cell lysate and the shed ectodomain (sSEZ6) in the supernatant were detected by immunoblots in the transfected cells, but not in control transfected cells (Fig.

6a

). Addition of the BACE inhibitor C3 decreased the sSEZ6 (Fig.

6a

), in agreement with the results in neurons (Fig.

2b

). The expected C-terminal fragment arising through BACE1 cleavage was not detected in control cells without the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT, presumably because of its fast turnover. However, γ-secretase inhibition led to a strong accumulation of the SEZ6 C-terminal fragment at a molecular weight of around 13 kDa (Fig.

6b

), which is consistent with the theoretical molecular weight of about 10 kDa for the C-terminal fragment starting at the BACE1 cleavage site and ending with the C-terminal FLAG-tag. These results indicate that SEZ6 is a γ-secretase substrate.

sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L are detected in murine CSF in BACE1-dependent manner

Finally, we tested in vivo whether levels of sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L in murine CSF may be useful biomarkers for BACE1 activity in vivo. A previous proteomic study demonstrated that the soluble ectodomains of other BACE1 substrates, such as APLP1, PLXDC2 and CHL1, were reduced in the CSF of BACE1-deficient mice [

14

]. However, sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L were not consistently detected and could not be quantified in murine CSF, potentially because their levels were below the detection limit. Thus, we first improved the method for proteomic analysis of murine CSF in order to identify and quantify a larger number of proteins compared to the previous study. Most BACE1 inhibitors currently tested in clinical trials for AD are not specific for BACE1, but also inhibit BACE2. To mimic this situation we applied the improved proteomic method to the analysis of CSF from seven 4-month old BACE1/BACE2 double knock-out (BACE DKO) and seven age-matched WT mice.

In our previous protocol for mouse CSF proteomics, proteins were digested in the presence of urea and thiourea [

14

]. We replaced these nonionic chaotropes with the mild ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate (SDC), which has been shown to improve trypsin digestion of membrane proteins [

43

,

44

]. A concentration of 0.1 % SDC was sufficient to improve the digestion efficiency. Triplicates of a pooled mouse CSF sample were digested with either the urea or the SDC-supported digestion protocol. The number of identified unique peptides was 6.6 % lower for the SDC supported protocol (Table

1

). However, digestion efficiency was strongly increased which was detected by the 58.1 % lower number of average missed cleavages per peptide (Table

1

). Additionally, the average number of identified and quantified proteins was 10.3 and 7.5 % higher for the SDC supported digestion protocol, respectively. Subcellular locations of proteins quantified in all replicates of SDC or urea supported digestions were similar (Additional file

1

: Figures S2 and S3). However, the number of quantified membrane proteins was 8.9 % higher for the samples digested in the presence of SDC (135 vs. 124).

Next, BACE DKO CSF was compared to WT CSF. In contrast to our previous proteomic study of CSF from BACE1 deficient mice [

14

], we were able to quantify SEZ6 and SEZ6L with the optimized protocol (Additional file

2

: Supplementary Data: proteins BACE DKO vs WT CSF). The levels of several known or proposed BACE1 substrates such as SEZ6, SEZ6L, SCN4B, LRRN1, APLP1, APLP2, CACHD1 and NLGN4L were significantly reduced in BACE DKO CSF (Fig.

7a

). Among these proteins, SEZ6 (DKO/WT = 13 %,

p

= 5.99E-06) and SEZ6L (DKO/WT = 20 %,

p

= 5.10E-05) showed the strongest reduction as well as the highest statistical significance (Fig.

7a

). Changes in sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L also remained significant, when applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment (α = 5 %) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. In contrary, the third SEZ6 family member, SEZ6L2, did not show a significantly lower abundance in BACE DKO CSF, indicating that it is mostly cleaved by protease other than BACE1 or BACE2 (Fig.

7a

).

Interestingly, the interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST) was quantified in all WT CSF samples by four unique peptides but in none of the BACE DKO CSF samples. This indicates that IL6ST may be an additional BACE1 and/or BACE2 substrate. Another BACE substrate candidate could be the type-1 transmembrane protein hephaestin (HEPH), which was significantly reduced by 53 % in BACE DKO CSF. Hephaestin is known to be expressed in the brain [

45

]. Additionally, peptide sequences of transmembrane and GPI-anchored proteins were loaded into the bioinformatics software tool QARIP [

46

] to check for their position within the protein sequences. Peptides were almost exclusively mapped to extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins (Additional file

3

: Tables S1-S6). This indicates that most transmembrane proteins in the CSF are derived from proteolytic shedding and not from contaminating cells. For SEZ6, SEZ6L and SEZ6L2 only peptides from the ectodomain were identified (Additional file

3

: Table S1).

To validate the proteomic results, reduced abundance of sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L were confirmed using immunoblots of independent CSF samples (Fig.

7b

). In agreement with the proteomic analysis, sSEZ6 was nearly completely absent in BACE DKO CSF. The same reduction was observed in CSF from BACE1 KO, but not for BACE2 KO mice. This demonstrates that sSEZ6 is generated specifically by BACE1, but not by BACE2 in murine CSF. Likewise, sSEZ6L was strongly reduced in BACE1 KO CSF. Taken together, these results show that sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L levels can be used to monitor BACE1 activity in murine CSF.

Discussion

BACE1 is a major drug target in AD, but has additional substrates and thus contributes to various biological processes [

1

,

13

], which may limit its therapeutic potential. Recent proteomic studies have identified more than 40 membrane proteins as potential BACE1 substrates [

14

–

16

]. However, only few of them have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different techniques, our study validates SEZ6 and SEZ6L as BACE1 substrates in vitro and in vivo and demonstrates that, in contrast to other BACE1 substrates, SEZ6 and SEZ6L are nearly exclusively cleaved by BACE1 and not by other proteases in the brain. Levels of the soluble ectodomains (sSEZ6, sSEZ6L) were reduced to less than 10 % of the control levels upon pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 in primary neurons. Additionally, SEZ6 and SEZ6L were validated in vivo as BACE1 substrates using brains and CSF from BACE1 KO, BACE2 KO and/or BACE DKO mice. Thus, we propose that in addition to Aβ and sAPPβ, which are two BACE1 cleavage products of APP, sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L may be suitable as biomarkers to monitor BACE1 activity in vivo in CSF.

Several other previously identified BACE1 substrates, such as CHL1, L1, contactin-2, APP and its homolog APLP2, are not exclusively cleaved by BACE1, but also by other proteases, including ADAM10 [

15

,

38

]. For example, the APP homolog APLP2 is cleaved to about 60 % by BACE1 and to 40 % by ADAM10 in neurons, but the percentages may strongly vary for each substrate [

38

]. Additionally, the different proteases may compensate for each other, if one of them is blocked. One example is APP. BACE1 inhibition increases the ADAM10 cleavage of APP, such that total APP cleavage is only mildly reduced [

36

,

47

]. Potentially, this is also true for the third SEZ6 family member, SEZ6L2, which shows only moderately reduced shedding upon BACE1 inhibition [

15

]. A similar compensation does not occur for SEZ6 and SEZ6L in brain, where total cleavage was nearly completely abolished upon BACE1 inhibition. However, in other cell types and tissues both proteins may be cleaved by proteases different than BACE1. A previous study reported that in pancreatic cells SEZ6L is predominantly cleaved by BACE2, but not by BACE1 [

17

]. We confirm this finding and also extend it to SEZ6. Importantly, we show that neither SEZ6 nor SEZ6L are substrates for BACE1 in the pancreatic cell line, which is in contrast to brain, demonstrating that SEZ6 and SEZ6L are cleaved by different proteases in a tissue-specific manner. Precedents for such a tissue-specific proteolytic cleavage are the BACE1 substrates CHL1 and L1, which are mostly cleaved by BACE1 in the nervous system, but by ADAM proteases in non-neuronal cells [

15

,

37

]. We found opposite expression patterns of BACE1 and BACE2 in MIN6 cells and in neurons, which correlated with the tissue-specific cleavage of SEZ6 and SEZ6L. Whether the distinct protease cleavage events also lead to a different functional outcome for the substrates remains to be investigated. This is particularly relevant as different proteases may cleave at distinct peptide bonds and thus generate ectodomains of different lengths and potentially different functions. For example, in APP the ADAM10 and BACE1 cleavage sites are 16 amino acids apart from each other and yield APP ectodomains with diverging functions [

48

,

49

].

The molecular functions of SEZ6 and SEZ6L are not yet well understood. The name SEZ6 comes from the initial finding that SEZ6 expression was upregulated in cortical murine cells treated with the seizure-inducing drug pentylene tetrazole [

32

]. SEZ6 has been genetically linked to febrile seizures and epilepsy [

50

,

51

], whereas SEZ6L was associated with bipolar disorder [

52

]. The extracellular regions of SEZ6/SEZ6L contain three CUB (complement subcomponent C1r, C1s /sea urchin embryonic growth factor Uegf / bone morphogenetic protein 1) and five short consensus repeat domains, which are protein-binding domains that are also found in a variety of cell surface receptors. This suggests that SEZ6/SEZ6L may act as receptors at the cell surface. Importantly, our study demonstrates that BACE1 cleavage negatively regulates SEZ6 and SEZ6L surface levels in neurons, suggesting that BACE1 may directly control SEZ6/SEZ6L surface functions. This could be a more general function of BACE1, because BACE1 also negatively regulates surface levels and/or function of two other substrates, contactin-2 and CHL1 [

12

,

15

,

53

]. However, the function of SEZ6 and SEZ6L may not only be exerted by the full-length proteins, but also by sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L or even by the C-terminal fragments resulting from BACE1 cleavage, as recently found for the BACE1 substrate CHL1 [

12

].

Future studies need to address how exactly BACE1 alters SEZ6 and SEZ6L function and whether such alterations contribute to the multiple phenotypes observed in BACE1-deficient mice. Notably, both BACE1- and SEZ6-deficient mice have deficits in hippocampal learning paradigms [

18

,

54

–

56

] and in motor coordination [

18

,

57

]. Moreover, both mouse lines appear to have reduced levels of anxiety and/or cognitive deficits [

18

,

56

], reduced glutamatergic synapse function and reduced dendritic spine densities [

18

,

58

]. Given the substantial overlap, at least some of these phenotypes may result from the reduced cleavage products of SEZ6/SEZ6L.

Another major outcome of our study is an improved protocol for efficient proteomic analysis of murine CSF. While human CSF is available in milliliter quantities, only approximately 10 μl of murine CSF are obtainable. Here, we improved the digestion efficiency of murine CSF in comparison to our previous protocol by using 0.1 % SDC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate as digestion buffer. This was demonstrated by the strong reduction of the average missed cleavages per peptide as well as the increased number of identified and quantified proteins (Table

1

). The improved method may be of wide relevance for studying murine CSF in the context of different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, the new workflow allowed the quantification of SEZ6 and SEZ6L, which were not quantified in the previous study [

14

]. The nearly complete absence of sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L in murine CSF makes both cleavage products suitable markers to monitor BACE1 inhibition in mice. This may be particularly useful for determining the target engagement and potential side effects of BACE inhibitors in animal models. If confirmed in human CSF, sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L may even be useful as companion diagnostics to guide BACE inhibitor dosing in individual patients and monitor BACE1 inhibitor selectivity.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that SEZ6 and SEZ6L are physiological BACE1 substrates in the murine brain and that, in contrast to most other BACE1 substrates, these two proteins are nearly exclusively cleaved by BACE1. Levels of sSEZ6 and sSEZ6L were strongly reduced upon pharmacological inhibition or genetic deficiency of BACE1 in primary neurons and mouse brain. Additionally, we developed an improved method for whole proteome analysis of murine CSF and found that in the CSF of BACE DKO mice the soluble ectodomains of SEZ6 and SEZ6L were most strongly reduced among all BACE1 substrates identified, suggesting their use as potential biomarkers in CSF to monitor BACE1 activity in vivo in mice.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal solid tumor with a poor prognosis. The amount of estimated new PC cases and deaths both stand in second place in gastrointestinal cancer in the United States (

Siegel et al., 2020

). Up to now, surgery remains the foundation of curing PC, but the majority (80%–85%) of PC patients who present with unresectable or metastatic tumors lose the chance of surgery (

Mizrahi et al., 2020

). Whether it is early detection of resectable PC or late diagnosis of unresectable and metastatic PC, a wide range of PC patients require routine chemotherapy including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel and other multidrug regimens (

Conroy et al., 2011

;

Von Hoff et al., 2013

). Besides the progress on surgery techniques and chemotherapy approaches, exploring valid and novel biomarkers is another efficient method to improve the rate of early diagnosis and predict the prognosis of PC patients.

Epigenetic alterations affect gene function via changing organization and dynamics of chromatin, rather than changes in the DNA sequence (

Jabłońska and Reszka, 2017

). Several epigenetic regulatory mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and altered expression levels of noncoding RNAs. DNA methylation is defined as the methyl groups (CH

3

) transfer to the fifth carbon of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotides to form 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). Meanwhile, an increasing number of researches indicated that DNA methylation alterations served a major role in PC. Koutsioumpa et al. found that Lysine (K)-Specific Methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), which was regulated negatively by double-site CpG methylation-exerted antitumoral function; meanwhile, knockout of KMT2D increased aerobic glycolysis and proliferative rates via regulation of SLC2A3 (

Koutsioumpa et al., 2019

). Besides, methylation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) changes from plasma samples can be utilized for early detection in PC. The combination of the methylation of ADAMTS1 and BNC1 was employed to detect the early stages of PC, which were better than CA19-9 (

Eissa et al., 2019

). However, previous studies have not combined the methylation microarray and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data systematically to detect the specific characteristics in PC. Therefore, screening the DNA methylation-driven genes and identifying the vital biomarkers in PC for prognostic prediction is urgently needed.

In our research, we used the transcriptomic and DNA methylation expression data to filter differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and further detect DNA methylation-driven genes in PC. Then, we conducted the risk model with four screened genes and validated the robustness in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Finally, we established a nomogram via the clinicopathologic risk factors and risk score of DNA methylation-driven genes to predict overall survival (OS) in PC. We expect that these candidate genes may help improve the prediction of prognosis for PC.

Materials and Methods

Sample Datasets

With the use of RNA-seq data, 430 DNA methylation expression profiles were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The methylation expression levels were calculated by β values (unmethylated to totally methylated). The gene expression profiles of the GSE62452 cohort were acquired from the GEO. A total of 167 RNA-seq data of normal samples were extracted from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project.

Screening of Differentially Expressed Genes Between Pancreatic Cancer and Normal Samples

DEGs were screened between 178 PC samples from TCGA and 171 normal samples (4 from TCGA and 167 from GTEx) utilizing the “limma” R package (

Ritchie et al., 2015

). Threshold criteria the false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 and |log

2

fold change (FC)| > 1 combined.

Identification of DNA Methylation-Driven Denes

We identified the DNA methylation-driven genes of which mRNA expression levels are a negative relationship with the DNA methylation levels via linear regression analysis. Meanwhile, the DNA methylation status between PC tissues and normal PC tissues was compared utilizing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (

Cedoz et al., 2018

).

Survival Analysis

To assess the relation between DNA methylation-driven genes and OS of PC patients via the Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, the survminer package was used to get the optimal cutoff values of each data.

Construction and Validation of the Predictive Signature

We used the univariate Cox regression analysis, multivariate Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary logistic regression model to filter four DNA methylation-driven genes, and a predictive signature was constructed by the linear combination of the regression coefficients (β). The formula of risk score was below. Risk score = (β1 × expression level of RIC3) + (β2 × expression level of MBOAT2) + (β3 × expression level of SEZ6L) + (β4 × expression level of OAS2). Based on the median cutoff value in TCGA dataset, all PC patients were grouped into two groups of high and low risk. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were displayed for assessing predictive capacity. GSE62452 cohort was utilized to validate the robustness of the prognostic signature.

Screening the Clinical Factors for Prognosis

To assess the actual clinical significance of predictive signature and other clinical factors that were related to the prognosis of PC patients, we performed a preliminary screening by the univariate Cox regression analysis. The multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to narrow the confounding variables.

Building the Nomogram

We built a nomogram with every independent prognostic variable. Calibration curves were displayed to assess the predictive power of the nomogram in which the 45° line meant the best prediction.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software was performed to identify the biological pathways between the high- and low-risk groups.

p

-Value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Drug Sensitivity Prediction

We predicted the chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity based on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database (

https://www.cancerrxgene.org/

). pRRophetic package was used to estimate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

Exploration of DNA Methylation-Driven Genes in Pancreatic Cancer

We utilized the MethylMix analysis to explore DNA methylation-driven genes in PC. Utilizing the screening criteria, we used

p

-value < 0.05 to identify the differentially methylation expressed genes, a correlation <−0.3 was selected between DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels, and a total of 23 DNA methylation-driven genes were screened. The methylation expression level of each DNA methylation-driven gene was visualized via a heatmap (

Figure 2B

;

Supplementary Table S2

). Among them, OAS2 and MBOAT2 were hypomethylated; furthermore, the other 21 genes (e.g., PRDM5, ZNF90, VIPR2, TPTEP1, RIC3, and SEZ6L) were hypermethylated in PC.

Construction of the Prognostic Risk Score Model of DNA Methylation-Driven Genes for Pancreatic Cancer

To further filter out the candidate genes, we identified the nine candidate DNA methylation-driven genes that were statistically associated with OS (

p

< 0.05) by performing the univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (

Figure 3

;

Supplementary Table S3

). LASSO regression analysis is a method that narrows regression coefficients toward zero by an L1 penalty to shrink and select potential variants with nonzero coefficients (

Tibshirani, 1997

). Moreover, performing 1,000 repetitions of LASSO regression, we found that the variants of nonzero coefficients that occurred more frequently have a stronger capacity to predict prognosis. Finally, the four selected DNA methylation-driven genes (RIC3, MBOAT2, SEZ6L, and OAS2) were selected as prognostic genes by LASSO regression, which were needed to appear 1,000 repetitions and utilized in the risk score model (

Figures 4A,B

). K-M survival curves of the four selected genes show that the high expression of MBOAT2 and OAS2 had shorter OS than the PC patients of low expression (

p

< 0.01), indicating that MBOAT2 and OAS2 were risk factors in PC (

Figure 4C

). On the contrary, the high expression of RIC3 and SEZ6L was correlated with a longer survival time (

p

< 0.05), which meant that these genes played a protective role in PC (

Figure 4D

). Meanwhile, among the four DNA methylation-driven genes, MBOAT2 and OAS2 were hypomethylated, while RIC3 and SEZ6L were hypermethylated (

Figures 5A–H

). Then, the risk score was calculated with the expression level of each gene multiplied by the relative coefficient in the LASSO regression as follows: risk score = (−0.233 × RIC3 mRNA level) + (−0.079 × SEZ6L mRNA level) + (0.238 × MBOAT2 mRNA level) + (0.211 × OAS mRNA level). Afterward, the risk score of all patients was calculated with the above formula. We selected the median risk score (1.2589) to classify all PC patients into the high-risk group (88 patients) and the low-risk group (88 patients) from TCGA dataset. Meanwhile, the PC patients of the high-risk and low-risk groups were distributed by two distinct patterns by the principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S1). Meanwhile, the OS of the low-risk group was longer than that of the high-risk group significantly (

p

< 0.001;

Figure 6A

). The risk scores, survival status, and DNA methylation-driven gene expression profiles of each PC patient were visualized by the heatmap and scatter plot (

Figures 6C,E

). We also verified the predictive accuracy of the risk model of OS by ROC analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the 1-year OS rate with the prognostic model was 0.692, and the other time-dependent AUC values of 2- and 3-year OS rates were 0.693 and 0.663, respectively (

Figure 7A

). For further validating the predictive ability of the risk score model, we used the 65 PC samples, which had complete survival information in the validation cohort (GSE62452) from the GEO dataset. Similarly, we utilized the same risk score formula and median cutoff value before and the patients were grouped into two subgroups (the low-risk and high-risk groups). Ultimately, in accordance with the above results, the high-risk group of patients from the validation cohort had a noteworthy worse prognosis than the low-risk group (

Figure 6B

). The scatter plot of the distribution of risk scores and survival status and the heatmap plot of each gene expression are shown in

Figures 6D,F

. The AUCs of 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates with the prognostic model for PC patients were 0.513, 0.648, and 0.756, respectively (

Figure 7B

Establishment and Evaluation of a Predictive Prognostic Nomogram for Pancreatic Cancer

We used the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to assess the independent predictive capacity of the four-gene prognostic risk score model in 103 PC patients who possess complete clinical information including age, gender, stage, grade, family history, and the number of positive lymph nodes from TCGA cohort. The results showed that the risk score and clinical factors of age, grade, and the number of positive lymph nodes were correlated with OS by the univariate Cox regression analysis; meanwhile, these factors were also independent prognostic factors associated with OS after the multivariate Cox regression analysis (

p

< 0.05). However, gender, stage, and family history were irrelevant with OS with univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses (

Figures 7C,D

).

Because age, grade, the number of positive lymph nodes, and risk score were considered as significant and independent prognostic factors according to the abovementioned results, we generated a predictive nomogram with these factors (

Figure 8A

). Besides, the calibration curves of the model were used to evaluate the accuracy of the nomogram in which a 45° line represented the best prediction. As shown in

Figure 8B

, the predictive OS rates of 1, 2, and 3 years with nomogram demonstrated accurate predictive capacity.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Drug Sensitivity Prediction Between High- and Low-Risk Groups

GSEA was carried out to further explore the possible biological signaling pathways involved with the molecular mechanisms in the risk score model between the high-risk group and low-risk group. As shown in

Figure 9A

, the top six signaling pathways enriched in the high-risk score group were “BASE EXCISION REPAIR,” “CELL CYCLE,” “P53 SIGNALING PATHWAY,” “PATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTION,” “PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY,” and “PROTEASOME”. Furthermore, the top six signaling pathways of the low-risk group were significantly enriched for “BETA ALANINE METABOLISM,” “BUTANOATE METABOLISM,” “GLYCINE SERINE AND THREONINE METABOLISM,” “NEUROACTIVE LIGAND RECEPTOR INTERACTION,” “PRIMARY BILE ACID BIOSYNTHESIS,” and “TRYPTOPHAN METABOLISM” (

Figure 9B

). In general, the enriched signaling pathways in the results of GSEA may indicate significant molecular targets and mechanisms of PC.

Then, we used the GDSC database to predict the valid chemotherapy drugs of high- and low-risk groups.

Figure 9C

shows that the PC patients in the low-risk group sensitively responded to four drugs (dasatinib, docetaxel, bicalutamide, and midostaurin), whose IC50 was higher than that of the high-risk group (all

p

< 0.05).

Discussion

PC is one of the most lethal malignancies and has a poor prognosis (

Mizrahi et al., 2020

). Notwithstanding the benefits from the present progress on the diagnosis and treatment, the 5-year survival rate of PC only rose from 5% to 9% in the past decade (

Jemal et al., 2010

;

Siegel et al., 2020

). Up to now, there is a lack of valid and specific approaches to predict prognosis focused on PC patients. As shown in the previous studies, PC is characterized by multiple alterations in the genetic and epigenetic levels (

Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017

;

Shen et al., 2018

). Several studies identified that the innovative DNA methylation markers CD1D, BNC1, and ADAMTS1 have potential for detecting PC (

Yi et al., 2013

;

Kisiel et al., 2015

). Meanwhile, Henriksen et al. demonstrated that they established a diagnostic prediction model with eight methylated genes of which AUC is 0.86 for the diagnosis of PC (

Henriksen et al., 2016

). Besides, the methylation status of three mucin genes (MUC1, MUC2, and MUC4) was used to construct the predicted models for outcome after surgery (

Yokoyama et al., 2020

). Therefore, identifying specific DNA methylation-driven genes is much vital for PC.

For identifying the global DNA methylation patterns in PC, we combined RNA-seq with DNA methylation profiles to perform a comprehensive analysis. First of all, we screened 8,809 DEGs between PC and normal pancreatic samples from TCGA and GTEx dataset and identified 23 DNA methylation-driven genes by the MethylMix algorithm. Then the univariate Cox and LASSO regression analyses were performed to get four DNA methylation-driven genes (RIC3, MBOAT2, SEZ6L, and OAS2), which were strongly associated with OS. Moreover, the above four genes had been reported in some researches to be closely related to the different types of tumors. Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 (RIC3) was identified to fuse with T-cell receptor beta constant 2 (TCRBC2) as fusion transcript and considered carcinogenic in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (

Ló pez-Nieva et al., 2019

). Loss of the normal function of seizure-related 6 homolog like (SEZ6L) could accelerate the progression of lung cancer (

Gorlov et al., 2007

). Suzuki et al. elaborated that SEZ6L was hypermethylated and might be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (

Suzuki et al., 2002

). Besides, CpG methylation of SEZ6L was increased in gastric cancer compared with non-neoplastic mucosa and played a carcinogenic role (

Kang et al., 2008

;

Sepulveda et al., 2016

). 2′-5′-Oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) had increased expression and was screened to construct prognostic signature in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); meanwhile, the high expression of OAS2 was associated with poor OS (

Wang et al., 2020

).

Next, based on these four DNA methylation-driven genes, we constructed the risk score model to evaluate the prognosis of PC, and the patients were distinguished into high- and low-risk groups, which demonstrated a distinct distribution by PCA. Of note, high-risk patients had a shorter OS than low-risk patients, whether in the training cohort from TCGA dataset or the validation cohort (GSE62452) from the GEO dataset. Then the time-dependent AUCs of 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were used to assess the accuracy of the risk score model, and the results displayed good predictive ability. Furthermore, we filtered several clinical information (age, grade, and the number of positive lymph nodes) as independent prognostic factors associated with OS and built a nomogram with the risk score and these clinical factors to predict the individual possible survival times in clinical practice. The calibration plots indicated that the nomogram had an excellent and credible predictive property. To further study which biological mechanisms play vital roles in different risk groups, we conducted GSEA, and the results show that the pathways of p53 signaling, cell cycle, base excision repair,

Escherichia coli

infection, and proteasome were significantly enriched in the high-risk group. However, the pathways related to amino acid metabolism and neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction were significantly enriched in the low-risk group. Furthermore, PC is frequently resistant to chemotherapy, which leads to a poor prognosis. Our results showed that the patients in the low-risk group might benefit from multiple drugs including dasatinib, docetaxel, bicalutamide, and midostaurin. It means that the risk model based on the DNA methylation-driven genes might be a guide for chemotherapy regimens for PC patients.

As far as we know, the predictive model with four DNA methylation-driven genes has not been previously reported in PC, and it will be useful for evaluating the prognosis of patients with PC from a clinical perspective. Furthermore, there are also some limitations in our study. Though some research had proved that the expression or DNA methylation levels of several genes in our prognostic signature were correlated with prognosis in many cancers, the related functions of four genes were not demonstrated in PC. Besides, the risk score model in our present study displayed favorable performance in TCGA dataset and external validation, but there is a lack of evidence to confirm that our predictive signature is preferable to traditional testing methods, such as imaging evaluation or CA19-9. Thus, we are required for further biological experiments to verify the specific roles of four genes in PC. In addition, the nomogram incorporates age, grade, the number of positive lymph nodes, and risk score to predict the OS of PC patients successfully, but the number of PC patients and other clinical characteristics was insufficient. Afterward, much more sequencing data and clinical information from the multi-centric study are indispensable, and a better prognostic nomogram will be constructed in the future.

In conclusion, a risk score model of four DNA methylation-driven genes and the nomogram were built and have reliable predictive capacity for PC. In clinical practice, measuring the expression levels of four genes to calculate the risk score and integrating it with age, grade, and the number of positive lymph nodes of PC patients can prompt individualized prediction of OS in PC patients.

### Gene: TAFA5 (5 articles)

#### TAFA5 - Article 1: TAFA5 promotes proliferation and migration in gastric cancer
<Date>: 2019-10-02
<PMCID>: 6797941
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide (

1

). Although its incidence and mortality rates have markedly declined in western countries over the last century (

2

,

3

), GC remains a serious health burden in some parts of the world, such as China and Japan (

1

,

4

). Surgery is currently the only available radical treatment for GC, but patients are often diagnosed at later stages, rendering them unfit for radical surgery, or they experience postsurgical disease relapse or metastasis, which worsens their prognosis (

5

). Comprehensive treatment for advanced GC remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying GC invasion and metastasis is of vital importance.

TAFA chemokine like family member 5 (TAFA5), also known as Family with sequence similarity 19-member A5 C-C motif chemokine like, belongs to the TAFA family, which includes 5 members that are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (

6

). These genes encode small secreted proteins named TAFA1-TAFA5, which are evolutionarily close to macrophage inflammatory protein 1A [currently known as chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3)], a member of the small C-C chemokine family (

6

). Under physical conditions, TAFA5 colocalizes with vasopressin and oxytocin in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and may be involved in fluid homeostasis regulation (

7

). In addition, TAFA5 is a downstream target of Wnt family member 9 (Wnt9) b and can be activated by interactions between c-Myc and β-catenin to induce Wnt9b/β-catenin-mediated progenitor renewal in the developing kidney (

8

,

9

). Furthermore, TAFA5 inhibits osteoclast formation along with its receptor, formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), by stimulating bone marrow-derived macrophages (

10

). Using a proteomic approach, Janvilisri

et al

(

11

) identified TAFA5 as one of the most increased serum tumor markers that could distinguish human cholangiocarcinoma from benign biliary tract diseases. In addition, Diaz de Stahl

et al

(

12

) analyzed 50 glioblastoma samples with a high-resolution tiling-path chromosome 22 array and discovered 2 amplified regions on chromosome 22 that were characteristics for patients with tumors. Further analysis of these regions revealed two novel genes, including TAFA5. As no such variation was identified in a series of normal individuals, the authors speculated that these genes were involved in glioma tumorigenesis (

12

). In a large-scale genome-wide association study, Wu

et al

(

13

) identified 5 loci associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, including one that was located upstream of TAFA5 at chromosome 22.

Although an accumulating body of evidence has been suggestive of the involvement of TAFA5 in tumorigenesis, its role in GC development and progression remains unclear. The present study evaluated the clinical and prognostic significance of TAFA5 in 90 human GC samples and validated the results with data from two public datasets. The present study also investigated the

in vitro

activities of TAFA5 in cultured GC cells and characterized the potential underlying mechanisms of action.

Materials and methods

Patients and specimens

A total of 18 paired human GC samples and their matched gastric normal tissues (NTs) were collected at the time of surgical resection at the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University (Shanghai, China) between February 2017 and February 2018. These samples were from 13 males and 5 females, with a median age of 64 (range 52–86). Patients were included in the study if they were initially diagnosed with GC, underwent the surgery and had complete clinicopathological information. Those who had extensively metastatic tumors, suffered from life-threatening diseases such as severe cardiovascular disease or had other types of tumors besides GC were excluded from the study. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Paraffin-embedded tissues were retrieved from the Tissue Bank of the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University, and 4-µm tissue sections were prepared by the Department of Pathology of the same hospital. The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University (ethical approval form no. 2017-097) and adhered to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to tissue collection for experimentation.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Microarray sections of GCs and neighboring NTs were prepared by Shanghai Outdo Biotech Co., Ltd. These sections contained 90 paired GC and NTs from patients [the tissue microarray (TMA) cohort] and the clinicopathological characteristics of these patients are summarized in

Table I

. Following deparaffination, rehydration in graded ethanol, antigen retrieval with citrate buffer pH 6.0 (1:300 dilution; cat. no. ZLI-9065; OriGene Technologies, Inc.) and blocking with goat serum (1:20 dilution; cat. no. C0265; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h, slides were stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human TAFA5 (1:50 dilution; cat. no. 13948-1-AP; ProteinTech Group, Inc.) at 4°C overnight. Normal rat immunoglobulin G (1:50 dilution; cat. no. D110504; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) instead of the primary antibody was used as a control. Subsequently, after washing with PBS, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; goat anti-rabbit, cat. no. A0208 and goat anti-rat, cat. no. A0192; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, these sections were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (1:25 dilution; cat. no. GK500705; Gene Tech Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 5 min and counterstained with 100% hematoxylin (cat. no. C0107; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 2 min. A modified H-score system was used to semi-quantitate TAFA5 expression, as previously described (

14

). Briefly, the maximal intensity of staining (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong) was multiplied by the percentage of positive tumor cells (0–100%) to generate the modified H-score (range: 0-300). TAFA5 staining was categorized as high or low expression using the median H-score.

Access to public datasets

The mRNA expression of TAFA5 in GC tissues and normal mucosae was acquired from Oncomine (

www.oncomine.org

) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession no. GSE79973). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) RNA-sequence data and corresponding phenotype data were downloaded from UCSC Xena (

https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/

). The results in the present study are in whole or part based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network (

cancergenome.nih.gov

). The expression of TAFA5 in TCGA STAD was further validated by two online analyzing tools specifically designed for TCGA data analysis (

gepia.cancer-pku.cn/detail.php?gene=FAM19A5

and

ualcan.path.uab.edu/cgi-bin/TCGAExResultNew2.pl?genenam=FAM19A5&ctype=STAD

). The original data for the prognostic analysis of TAFA5 were downloaded from Kaplan-Meier Plotter (

www.kmplot.com

) and UCSC Xena (

xenabrowser.net/heatmap/

).

Cell lines

A gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) and GC cell lines (AGS, HGC27, NCI-N87, MGC803 and SNU-1) were obtained from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All of the cells were validated by short tandem repeat DNA profiling and were confirmed negative for Mycoplasma contamination. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (BBI Life Sciences Corporation) or F12K medium (Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (cat. no. E600001; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.), 100 µg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO

2

in a humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

Construction of TAFA5-targeting short hairpin (sh)-RNAs and packaging of lentiviruses. Two targeting shRNAs (shTAFA5-1 and shTAFA5-2) and a nontargeting scrambled RNA (scramble) were subcloned into the GV248 lentivirus vector by Shanghai GeneChem Co., Ltd. The shTAFA5-1 target sequence was 5′-CGCAAGAATCATCAAGACCAA-3′, and the shTAFA5-2 target sequence was 5′-CACCTGTGAGATTGTGACCTT-3′. Lentiviral stocks were prepared, as previously described (

15

).

RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures or from snap-frozen tissues from patients with GC using RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reverse transcribed with HiScript Q Select RT SuperMix (cat. no. R132-01; Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (cat. no. Q131-02; Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.) and quantified using the 2

−ΔΔCq

method (

16

). The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 32 sec, 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec and 95°C for 15 sec. Each sample was assayed in duplicate. All PCR products were confirmed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequences of the primers were as follows: TAFA5, forward 5′-GTGAGTTTGGCCACTCCGTA-3′ and reverse 5′-GAATGGACAGATGGCTGGCA-3′; and GAPDH, forward 5′-GTCAAGGCTGAGAACGGGAA-3′ and reverse 5′-AAATGAGCCCCAGCCTTCTC-3′. Experiments were repeated three times in duplicate.

Western blotting

Total protein was extracted from cell cultures or homogenized tissues from patients with GC using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and proteinase inhibitor cocktail solution (Roche Diagnostics), and quantified via the bicinchoninic acid assay method, as recommended by the manufacturer. Western blotting was performed according to standard methods as previously described (

17

). Briefly, proteins (30 µg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TAFA5 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. no. 13948-1-AP; ProteinTech Group, Inc.) and monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin and ZEB-1 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. nos. 3195, 13116, 5741 and 3396, respectively; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) overnight at 4°C. GAPDH (1:2,000; rabbit anti-human; cat. no. AF1186; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) or β-actin (1:2,000; mouse anti-human; cat. no. AF0003; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) were detected as the loading controls. The membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000; goat anti-mouse cat. no. A0216 and goat anti-rabbit cat. no. A0208; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. The proteins were finally visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (cat. no. P0018AS; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). The grayscale values of protein bands were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).

Proliferation assay

Stably infected AGS and HGC-27 cells (2×10

3

cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h. Then, 10 µl Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent (10% v/v in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments, Inc.).

Migration assay

A Transwell migration assay was performed as previously reported (

18

). Briefly, cells (4×10

5

cells/ml) were seeded in serum-free RPMI-1640 or F12K medium in the top chamber of the Transwell insert. Medium containing 20% FBS in the lower chamber served as chemoattractant. Following incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the cells on the top side of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and the migrated cells on the bottom side were fixed with methanol for 20 min and then stained with crystal violet (0.1% in PBS) for 15 min. A total of 6 randomly selected fields per well were imaged under an inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH) using the ImageScope software (Leica Microsystems GmbH) with a magnification of ×200. Then cells were manually counted and analyzed by Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation) and the number of migrated cells was counted.

Scratch wound healing assay

A monolayer scratch wound assay was employed to evaluate cell migration, as previously described (

19

). Briefly, cells (4×10

5

cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to nearly 100% confluence in 10% FBS-containing medium, before being washed with PBS and transferred to serum-free medium for 24 h. Then, a scratch wound was generated with a 200 µl pipette tip. Wound closure was imaged at 0, 24 and 48 h under an inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH) using the ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems GmbH) with a magnification of ×40. Then the wound closure rates were analyzed by ImageJ (v1.8.0; National Institutes of Health).

Gene set enrichment analysis

The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is developed by the Broad Institute website (

http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp

). All GSEA analyses were performed using the GSEA 2.2.2 software. The TCGA STAD RNA-seq data were loaded into GSEA and run with the latest version of Hallmarks gene sets. The number of permutations was set at 1,000, and patient data were divided into TAFA5 high and low groups by the median of TAFA5 expression. Then GESA was performed according to the default weighted enrichment statistics and genes were ranked by the Pearson method. Gene sets were considered significantly enriched if P<0.05 and FDR < 0.25. Those gene sets that were significantly enriched in the TAFA5 high group were designated as TAFA5-positively related gene sets, while those that were significantly enriched in the TAFA5 low group were designated as TAFA5-negatively correlated gene sets.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation), GraphPad Prism7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.), and SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp.). Student's t-test was used for statistical comparisons between two groups, while statistical comparisons among multiple groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Pearson's χ

2

test and Fisher's exact test were used for categorical comparisons. Survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. All statistical tests were two-sided. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results

TAFA5 is upregulated in GC

By analyzing the TAFA5 expression profile data from a GEO GC dataset (GSE79973), the present study revealed that TAFA5 was upregulated in GC tissues compared with NTs (n=10 pairs; P<0.001;

Fig. 1A

). RNA sequencing data from TCGA STAD also revealed an increase in TAFA5 expression in GC tissues (n=415) compared with in NTs (n=35; P<0.001;

Fig. 1B

), which was further validated by online analysis tools Gepia and Ualcan (data not shown). Two additional GC datasets [Derrico gastric(GEO: GSE13911), n=69; and Cho gastric(GEO: GSE13861), n=90](

20

,

21

) with Lauren's classification in the Oncomine database indicated that TAFA5 was generally overexpressed in each cancer group when compared with the control group, although the differences were not significant in three cases with smaller samples (

Fig. 1C and D

). To further validate these observations, the present study measured TAFA5 expression in 18 GC tissues and their matched NTs by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results indicated that TAFA5 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in GC tissues compared with NTs (

Fig. 1E-H

). Taken together, these results indicated that TAFA5 was upregulated in GC.

Overexpression of TAFA5 in GC correlates with unfavorable prognosis

To test the hypothesis that TAFA5 protein abundance in GC contributes to increased malignancy, the present study examined the TAFA5 expression levels in primary GC tissues of a TMA cohort by IHC. As shown in

Fig. 2A

, TAFA5 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells, and its expression was stronger in GC tissues than in NTs. The H-score was then used to quantitate TAFA5 staining in these tissues, which revealed that TAFA5 expression was significantly increased in GC compared with NTs (

Fig. 2B

). The associations between TAFA5 expression and clinicopathological variables are summarized in

Table II

. High TAFA5 expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation, and worse tumor, nodal and metastasis stages.

Next, the present study determined the association between TAFA5 expression and patient outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the TMA cohort revealed that patients with high TAFA5 expression exhibited a shorter overall survival (OS) compared with those with low expression [estimated mean OS 30.5 months with 95% confidence interval (CI) 22.9–38.1 months vs. OS 53.0 months with 95% CI 44.5–61.6 months; log-rank test, P=0.001;

Fig. 2C

]. To further confirm the adverse prognostic role of TAFA5 in patients with GC, the present study downloaded and analyzed TAFA5 transcription data from TCGA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter datasets. The results demonstrated that high TAFA5 expression was correlated with worse OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in both patient cohorts (

Fig. 2D-G

). Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model revealed that TAFA5 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter OS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04–3.44; P=0.036], following adjustments for tumor size, tumor stage and nodal stage (

Table III

). Taken together, these results indicated that TAFA5 was a prognostic marker in GC that was associated with unfavorable prognoses.

TAFA5 promotes the proliferation and migration of cultured GC cells

To gain insight into the potential role of TAFA5 in GC progression, the present study first examined the intrinsic expression levels of TAFA5 in a normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1, and in five GC cell lines, via RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results indicated that TAFA5 expression was markedly increased in GC cells when compared with GES-1 cells (

Fig. 3A and B

). TAFA5 expression was then silenced in HGC-27 and AGS cells with lentiviruses carrying two TAFA5-specific shRNAs (

Fig. 3C and D

). In cultured GC cells, CCK-8 assays revealed that knockdown of TAFA5 expression significantly inhibited proliferation (

Fig. 4A and B

). In addition, knockdown of TAFA5 expression decreased cell migration in the scratch wound healing assay (

Fig. 4C and D

) and in the Transwell migration assay (

Fig. 4E and F

). Collectively, these results indicated that TAFA5 promoted the proliferation and migration of GC cells.

TAFA5 may function by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC

To characterize the potential mechanism of TAFA5 in promoting tumor progression, the present study used the RNA-seq data for GC samples from TCGA to conduct gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (

22

,

23

). The results revealed that TAFA5 expression was positively correlated with genes involved in EMT, but not with those in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (

Fig. 5A

). Furthermore, as shown in

Fig. 5B

, TAFA5 expression was moderately positively correlated with snail family transcriptional repressor (SNAI) 1, SNAI2, twist family bHLH transcription factor (TWIST) 1, TWIST2, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) 1, ZEB2, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Wnt9a and Wnt9b, and weakly correlated with SNAI3, E-cadherin and β-catenin (data not shown). In addition, protein expression levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin were increased, while the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Vimentin, and the EMT-associated transcription factor ZEB1 were decreased, following TAFA5 silencing in GC cells (

Fig. 5C

). Taken together, these results suggested an active role for TAFA5 in promoting tumor aggressiveness via EMT in GC.

Discussion

Due to effective early screening and Helicobacter pylori eradication, great achievements have been made in controlling the prevalence and mortality rates of GC (

1

). However, GC remains a serious health threat in some parts of the world, such as China, due to early metastasis and postsurgical relapse (

4

,

5

). Comprehensive therapy is often ineffective in patients at later stages; thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease progression, and identification of potential therapeutic targets, would be clinically and scientifically beneficial. In the present study, TAFA5 was upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. High expression of TAFA5 was significantly associated with worse clinical characteristics and unfavorable prognosis in patients with GC. The prognostic value of TAFA5 was validated using data from TCGA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases. Knockdown of TAFA5 expression inhibited the proliferation and migration of cultured GC cells. Taken together, the present results indicated that TAFA5 may be a novel prognostic marker in patients with GC and that it may have a crucial role in promoting tumor progression via the regulation of cell proliferation and migration.

As TAFA family members are mainly expressed in the central nervous system, the majority of studies have focused on the regulation of nerve and hormone homeostasis (

24

–

27

). However, TAFA family members encode small secreted proteins that are evolutionarily close to CCL3 (

6

), whose involvement in various malignancies has been extensively investigated. For example, CCL3 promotes oral carcinogenesis via the induction of inflammatory and angiogenic pathways, and eosinophil recruitment (

28

); it also mediates the cyclophosphamide-induced intratumoral migration of CD4

+

T cells and tumor regression in hepatic carcinomas (

29

), suggesting a cell type-dependent role in carcinogenesis. Based on these results, these TAFA family members are probably involved in carcinogenesis. In the present study, unfavorable prognostic effects of TAFA5 in patients with GC were reported and the results were validated with two larger patient cohorts. Furthermore, silencing of TAFA5 in GC cells

in vitro

suppressed cell proliferation and migration. These results indicated that TAFA5 may promote progression of GC.

In total, 5 consensus Lef/Tcf binding sites are located within intron 2 of TAFA5, and at least 2 of these sites have been physically associated with β-catenin. Thus, TAFA5 is a downstream target of the Wnt9b/β-catenin signaling pathway in the maintenance of nephron progenitor cell renewal (

8

,

9

). Furthermore, it has been reported that EMT serves an essential role in tumor progression and is involved in the proliferation and migration of multiple types of human tumors (

30

). In the present study, GSEA using RNA-seq data from TCGA revealed that TAFA5 expression was positively correlated with genes involved in EMT, but not the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Further correlation analyses using the same data revealed that TAFA5 expression was moderately associated with Wnt9a and Wnt9b, as well as several EMT-activating transcription factors, and only weakly associated with β-catenin. Based on the complex cross-talk among pathways, these results suggested that TAFA5-induced GC progression may involve multiple pathways. Furthermore, Park

et al

(

10

) demonstrated that TAFA5 inhibited osteoclastogenesis via the mediation of its target receptor, formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). In addition, Wang

et al

(

31

) revealed that TAFA5 was able to inhibit postinjury neointima formation through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Based on these studies, it is possible that FPR2 and S1PR2 may be potential target receptors that link TAFA5 to the proliferation and migration in GC; this hypothesis warrants further investigation.

There are several limitations in the present study. Firstly, since most cell lines used in the present study were poorly differentiated, it was not possible to determine whether TAFA5 expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of these cell lines. Secondly, as TAFA5 is widespread in serum and has been identified as a novel serum biomarker to differentiate cholangiocarcinoma from benign biliary tract diseases (

11

), measuring its serum concentration in GC patients may also have clinical significance. As the cases are still accumulating, data from sera analyses were not included in the current study. The above limitations will be addressed in future studies.

In conclusion, the present study identified TAFA5 as a novel prognostic marker for GC, which may accelerate tumor progression by promoting GC cell proliferation and migration via the modulation of EMT-associated pathways. The present results thus highlight the importance of future investigation of this putative marker.

Introduction

Chemokine like ligands have pleiotropic functions in diverse tissues such as peripheral nerves and brain. TAFA or FAM19A proteins represent a new class of chemokine like ligands that are revealed as neuron-derived secretory proteins, or neurokines, and have been implicated in the regulation of immune responses within the central nervous system (CNS). The TAFA family comprises five members of ligands, namely TAFA1, TAFA2, TAFA3, TAFA4, and TAFA5 (also known as FAM19A1, FAM19A2, FAM19A3, FAM19A4, and FAM19A5, respectively). The TAFA family genes encode approximately 12–15 kDa secretory proteins, which are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous tissues. TAFAs were found to act as neutrophil chemotactic factors (

Postma et al., 2004

;

Prat et al., 2009

), and to coordinate with other chemokines to recruit immune cells and regulate their activity in the CNS (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

;

Sarver et al., 2021

). TAFAs also act as neurokines to regulate nervous cell and tissue repair and regeneration after brain injury (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

;

Sarver et al., 2021

). Among TAFA ligands, TAFA4, also called FAM19A4 is a secreted chemokine-like protein of 12 kDa weight, which has been relatively well studied, with research implicating its importance for the detection of cervical cancer (

Delfini et al., 2013

;

Wang et al., 2015

;

Luttmer et al., 2016b

).

The critical role of TAFA4 in cancer diagnosis continues to be a vital area of research. For instance, analysis by Quantitative Methylation-Specific PCR shows that methylation of the FAM19A4 (or TAFA4) gene is a putative marker for patients with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (

Steenbergen et al., 2013

;

Luttmer et al., 2016a

;

Luttmer et al., 2016b

;

De Strooper et al., 2016

;

Lorincz, 2016

;

De Strooper et al., 2018

;

Vink et al., 2021

). FAM19A4 gene DNA methylation therefore appears to be an attractive marker for the detection of advanced cervical carcinoma lesions in hrHPV-positive patients (

De Strooper et al., 2014

;

Vink et al., 2020

;

Bonde et al., 2021

). DNA methylation of FAM19A4 could also be a potential biomarker of lung cancer (

Hubers et al., 2017

;

Liu et al., 2017

). Further studies are required to confirm the involvement of DNA methylation of TAFA4/FAM19A4 in the development of cancers in the cervix and lung, and to add DNA methylation of TAFA4/FAM19A4 as an additional diagnostic marker to improve specificity and sensitivity.

This review discusses the molecular structures, expression, and emerging role of TAFA4 receptor signalling with a focus on the spinal cord system and neuronal disorders. We survey comparative structure analyses of TAFA4 with other TAFA family members, and their putative receptors, formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1, also called N-formylpeptide chemoattractant receptor, N-formyl peptide receptor, fMet-Leu-Phe receptor; fMLF-R; fMLP receptor; FMLP) and FPR2. Understanding the pathophysiology of TAFAs in tissue tropism will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic targets for related diseases.

Molecular Structure and Expression of TAFA4

Multiple sequence alignment analyses show that TAFA4 (or FAM19A4) displays conserved sequence identity among species, including mouse, human, cynomolgus monkey, rat, chimpanzee, and dog (

Figure 1A

), with a common family tree (

Figure 1B

) (

UniPort Consortium, 2021

). TAFA4 shows sequence homology with TAFA1, 2, 3 and 5 by multiple sequence alignment analyses, which demonstrate that TAFAs have a conserved CX7CCX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C motif, except TAFA5, which has a CX7DSX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C motif (

Figure 2A

), and TAFAs share a common family tree (

Figure 2B

) (

UniPort Consortium, 2021

).

Gene expression profile analyses by BioGPS revealed that TAFA4 mRNA is most abundantly expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), followed by retina, lens, embryonic stem cells, and iris and hypothalamus in mouse (

Figure 3A

) (

Wu et al., 2009

). Consistently, gene expression analyses by Euxassay showed that TAFA4 mRNA is most abundantly expressed in DRG of mouse embryonic tissue of day 14.5 (

Figure 3B

). In line with this, TAFA4 was reported to be expressed in the thalamus of the central nervous system (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

). TAFA4 expression is also induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in monocytes and macrophages, particularly in polarized M1 macrophages (

Wang et al., 2015

;

Li et al., 2018

).

).

Molecular structural analyses revealed that human TAFA4 consists of a signal sequence (amino acid residues 1–30), and chemokine-like protein (amino acid residues 31–140) (

Figure 4A

). Secondary structural analyses predicted that TAFA4 contains an alpha helix at its N terminal region, and nine beta strands at its C terminal region by Phyre2 web portal analysis (

Figure 4B

) (

Kelley et al., 2015

). A predicted 3D structure of TAFA4 is consistent with its secondary structure features (

Figure 4C

) (

Jumper et al., 2021

).

In comparison with the structure of TAFA4, the human TAFA1 gene (also called FAM19A1) encodes a 133 amino acid (aa) precursor which consists of a signal sequence (1–19 residues) and a mature chain (20–133 residues). It has a typical motif structure of CX7CCX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C, at the C terminal region. TAFA1 is detected in the brain, where it is most abundantly expressed in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal cortices, and medulla, whilst it is expressed at low levels in the basal ganglion, thalamus, and cerebellum (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

).

The human TAFA2 gene (also called FAM19A2) encodes a 131aa precursor which consists of a signal sequence (1–30 residues) and a mature chain (31–131 residues). It has a typical structure of CX7CCX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C at the C terminal region. TAFA2 is most abundantly expressed in the occipital and frontal cortices, and medulla within the CNS, followed by colon, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, and thymus (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

).

The human TAFA3 gene (also called FAM19A3) encodes a 133aa precursor which consists of a signal sequence (1–30 residues) and a mature chain (31–133 residues). It bears a typical structure of CX7CCX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C at the C terminal region. TAFA3 is differentially expressed in the brain (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

).

The human TAFA5 gene (also called FAM19A5) encodes a 132aa precursor which consists of a signal sequence (1–43 residues) and a mature chain (44–132 residues). It has a distinct structure of CX7DSX13CXCX14CX11CX4CX5CX10C at the C terminal region. TAFA5 is most abundantly expressed in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

).

Overall, FAM19A genes are expressed during CNS development and in the postnatal brain (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

;

Sarver et al., 2021

). Utilizing the Genevisible®- based bioinformatics tool (

Hruz et al., 2008

), comparative analyses of TAFA1-4 gene expressions showed that they are predominantly in the spinal cord, retina, lens and iris (data not shown).

Molecular Structure and Expression of TAFA4 Receptor FPR1

FPR1 belongs to the G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily (

Yamagami et al., 1994

). It exhibits sequence identity among species, including human, mouse, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, rat, and rabbit (

Figure 5A

) with a common family tree (

Figure 5B

). FPR1 also shares sequence homology and conserved cysteine residues with FPR2 (

Figure 6

).

FIGURE 5

Multiple sequence alignment analyses show that FPR1 shares sequence identity and similarity with FPR1 homologues among various species including human, mouse, chimpanzee, Rhesus macaque, rat, and rabbit (

).

(B)

A family tree of FRP1 homologue proteins is elucidated.

FIGURE 6

Comparative sequence alignment of FPR1and FPR2. Multiple sequence analysis demonstrates that human FRP1 and FPR2 share significant degree of amino acid sequence identity.

The human FPR1 gene encodes a 350aa protein that is predicted to consist of two putative N-linked glycosylation residues at positions 4 and 10, and a disulphide bond at residues 98 ↔ 176 (

Figure 7A

). It also consists of three putative phosphoserine sites (residues 328, 332, and 338) and four putative phosphothreonine sites (residues 329, 331, 334, 336, and 339). It has multiple alpha helices and beta strands (

Figure 7B

) and seven transmembrane domains (

Figure 7C

) as predicted by the Phyre2 web portal (

Kelley et al., 2015

). Similarly, the human FPR2 gene encodes a 351aa protein that is predicted to consist of one putative N-linked glycosylation at position 4, and a disulphide bond at residues 98 ↔ 176 (

Figure 8A

). It too has multiple alpha helices and beta strands (

Figure 8B

) and seven transmembrane domains (

Figure 8C

) as predicted by the Phyre2 web portal (

Kelley et al., 2015

). Additional Phyre2 web portal analyses show that the 3D structures of both FPR1 and FPR2 were predicted to have one common structure (

Figure 9A

) (

Kelley et al., 2015

). The 3D structures of FPR1 (

Figure 9B

) and FPR2 (

Figure 9C

) were also predicted by AlphaFold analyses to be consistent with their secondary features (

Jumper et al., 2021

).

The Roles of TAFA4 and FPR1 in the Spinal Cord

The spinal cord is a vital tubelike structure originating from the brain stem and extending the length of the spinal column for the transmission of motor and sensory nerve signals, which are vitally important for the control of functions, such as reflexes and coordinated physical movements like walking. Spinal cord injury results in neurologic pain and disability. Nociceptors detect intense, noxious, painful stimuli and are present in a subpopulation of peripheral nerves with cell bodies located in DRG (body) and the trigeminal ganglion (face) (

Basbaum et al., 2009

). Nociception occurs when nociceptors become excited by a stimulus (chemical, thermal, or mechanical) that reaches a noxious intensity and the sensation of pain is evoked (

Basbaum et al., 2009

). TAFA4 (or FAM19A4) was shown to be a marker of C-low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), which are unique among sensors of touch, appearing to transmit both sensations of pleasantness and injury-induced mechanical pain (

Seal et al., 2009

;

Delfini et al., 2013

). Findings also suggest that TAFA4+ neurons exhibit intrinsic features of mechano-nociceptors (

Delfini et al., 2013

). Further, TAFA4-null mice showed elevated hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical stimuli, and excitability of spinal cord lamina IIi neurons in response to inflammation and nerve injury, whereas administration of recombinant TAFA4 in C57/Bl6 mice

via

an injection into the spinal canal was able to reverse carrageenan-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (

Delfini et al., 2013

). C-LTMR-derived TAFA4 is therefore postulated to modulate neuron excitation and to regulate the somatic sensation threshold which indicates it could be a potent analgesic agent (

Delfini et al., 2013

). TAFA4 is consistently reported to have an analgesic role in pain relief (

Delfini et al., 2013

;

Reynders and Moqrich, 2015

) and has been implicated in regulating spinal cord pain (

Delfini et al., 2013

;

Gaillard et al., 2014

;

Kambrun et al., 2018

). Using a knock-in mouse, TAFA4 was predominantly localised in C-LTMRs neurons in DRGs (

Salio et al., 2021

). Recent research further investigated the function of TAFA4 in modulating neuronal excitation and synaptic transmission (

Kambrun et al., 2018

). C-LTMR-derived TAFA4 was shown to enhance the inhibition of synaptic transmission from high-threshold C-fibres of spinal networks by depressing local excitatory synapses (

Kambrun et al., 2018

). Using an animal model of inflammation, findings from this study revealed that mechanical pain and neuronal response to a noxious stimulus was alleviated by TAFA4, which appears to be mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic transmission (

Kambrun et al., 2018

). These results demonstrated the integral function of TAFA4 in response to inflammation by the promotion of microglial retraction and the increased number of inhibitory synapses on lamina IIi somata (

Kambrun et al., 2018

). Conclusively, GABAergic interneurons appear to be a primary signal integration relay for C-LTMRs, and the release of TAFA4 by C-LTMRs is suggested to inhibit nociceptive excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord resulting in the alleviation of pain in pathogenic conditions (

Kambrun et al., 2018

). However, direct evidence to indicate FPR1/2 expression can be upregulated in DRG or spinal cord is lacking.

Most recently, TAFA4 was shown to relieve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity by restoring spinal neuron activity to normal, which is further suggestive of its therapeutic potential (

Yoo et al., 2021

). TAFA 4 was found to reverse inflammatory, postoperative, and spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced mechanical pain in mice (

Yoo et al., 2021

). Mechanistically TAFA4 was able to reverse injury-induced A-type K

+

(I

A

) current decreases in spinal lamina II outer excitatory interneurons (L-IIo ExINs) and was also able to simultaneously reverse SNI-induced increases in I

A

and decreases in hyperpolarization-activated current (I

h

) in lamina II inner inhibitory interneurons (L-IIi InhINs) (

Yoo et al., 2021

). The rescue of ion current changes to normal levels in both IN groups was dependent on low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs) (

Yoo et al., 2021

). TAFA4 therefore is effective at reversing injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and is a prime therapeutic target for the treatment of injury-induced mechanical pain. Leading recent research identified a neuroimmune regulatory pathway which is promoted by TAFA4 and has potential novel therapeutic applications for inflammatory diseases (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). TAFA4 derived from sensory neurons was shown to promote macrophage coordinated tissue repair (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). TAFA4 was found to be expressed by C-LTMRs, a subset of Gα

i

-Interacting Protein (GINIP) positive neurons in the skin, and to mediate the inflammatory profile of tissue-resident macrophages in a mouse model of sunburn skin damage (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). Conditional ablation of sensory neurons expressing GINIP resulted in defective tissue regeneration and in dermal fibrosis (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). Whilst deletion of Tafa4 in mice resulted in diminished expression of IL-10 by T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM4) positive dermal macrophages after UV-induced skin damage, which was accompanied by increased skin inflammation, impaired healing, poor tissue regeneration, and dermal fibrosis (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). Mechanistically these results suggest that TAFA4 is produced by C-LTMRs following UV-induced skin damage, which increases the production of IL-10 by tissue-resident macrophages and the survival of tissue-repair macrophages, leading to diminished skin inflammation, the prevention of tissue fibrosis, and enhanced tissue regeneration (

Hoeffel et al., 2021

). Additionally, reduced GABAergic inhibition is characteristic of neuropathic pain and previous research identified the involvement of GINIP in peripheral GABA type B (GABAB) receptor nociceptive signal transmission (

Gaillard et al., 2014

). GINIP null mice showed impaired responsiveness to GABAB, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and developed prolonged and specific hypersensitivity when tested by inflammation and neuropathy models (

Gaillard et al., 2014

). Together with subsequent findings suggesting a protective role of TAFA4 for injury-induced by mechanical and chemically induced neuro-inflammatory pain (

Kambrun et al., 2018

), TAFA4 consistently emerges as a promising therapeutic target for pain relief, and tissue repair and regeneration. Future research is necessary to develop the therapeutic potential of TAFA4 for the alleviation of pain from neuro-inflammatory disorders and injury-induced mechanical pain.

Previous research has identified TAFA4 as a cytokine ligand of FPR1 for the inflammatory response to pathogenic infections (

Wang et al., 2015

). TAFA4 is upregulated in monocytes and macrophages when induced by LPS, and FPR1 was identified as a receptor for TAFA4

via

ligand binding and blockage, and receptor internalization assays (

Wang et al., 2015

). This study also showed that TAFA4 was able to induce chemotactic activities on macrophages and enhance macrophage phagocytosis, which occurred with increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) (

Wang et al., 2015

). TAFA4 therefore appears to play a critical role in the chemoattraction and phagocytosis of macrophages, and ROS release following an infection (

Figure 11

) (

Wang et al., 2015

). Several studies of TAFA family interactions have provided insights of the molecular signalling mechanisms of TAFA4. For example, findings from these studies reveal that binding of TAFAs to FPR1 and FPR2 led to the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system and intracellular calcium mobilization (

Murphy and McDermott, 1991

;

Postma et al., 2004

;

Prat et al., 2009

). FAM19A1-A4 (or TAFA1-4) could also interact with the cysteine-loop domain of neurexins and presynaptic adhesion molecules

via

intermolecular disulphide bonds (

Khalaj et al., 2020

). The molecular events of signalling activation following ligand receptor bindings of TAFA4 remain incompletely known. FAM19As are thought to interact with cell surface neurexins to mediate signalling across the synapse through connecting presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons (

Figure 11

) (

Khalaj et al., 2020

;

Sarver et al., 2021

). Together further research is needed to illuminate whether FAM19A interactions are cell type specific both for FPR1 and FPR2 and define the cellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of TAFA4, which is vitally important for the development of therapeutic applications targeting TAFA4.

TAFA4 binds FPR1 and activates signalling pathways of Akt phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and ROS release, leading to various cellular activities. In addition, TAFA4 binds cell surface neurexin and mediates synapse homeostasis.

The Emerging Role of Other TAFAs in the Neural System and Disorders

FAM19As are predominantly expressed in specific subtypes of neurons and serve as cell type-specific regulators of neurexin modifications (

Tom Tang et al., 2004

;

Khalaj et al., 2020

). The nomenclature of human TAFAs and FAM19As are summarized in

Table 1

. Among five subfamily members of FAM19As/TAFAs proteins, the role of TAFA4 is relatively well characterised, whilst the role of other TAFAs is emerging.

For instance, FAM19A1 has recently been linked with regulating food intake and behaviour. Mice with AM19A1 deficiency revealed that male FAM19A1 KO mice displayed more altered food intake patterns during the light and dark cycle, accompanied with hyperactive, and locomotor hyperactivity than female KO mice (

Lei et al., 2019

). On the other hand, female FAM19A1 KO mice showed reduced anxiety and sensitivity to pain, associated with elevated norepinephrine and dopamine turnover in the striatum, suggesting sex-dependent phenotypes between male and female (

Lei et al., 2019

). Consistently, mice with FAM19A1 deficiency exhibited hyperactive locomotor behaviour, long-term memory deficits and fear acquisition failure (

Yong et al., 2020

). Using a LacZ reporter gene system, FAM19A1 was shown to be expressed in the pyramidal cells of cortical layers during brain development in mouse (

Yong et al., 2020

). In a study using hippocampal cultures, FAM19A1 was found to reduce neurexin O-glycosylation and heparan sulphate modification, suggesting that FAM19A1 is involved in the post-translational modification and function of neurexins (

Khalaj et al., 2020

). Collectively, these findings suggest that FAM19A1 plays a role in neurodevelopment and mature brain function (

Yong et al., 2020

).

Whilst TAFA2 is suspected to be a gene involved with the development of intellectual deficiency and mental retardation.

Wang X. et al. (2018)

reported that TAFA2 gene knockout mice exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory and increased level of anxiety-like behaviours. Further, TAFA2 deficiency resulted in severe neuronal reduction and increased apoptosis in the brain with downregulation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways with down regulation of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), c-fos and Neurofibromin 1(NF1), and CREB-binding protein (CBP) gene expression, suggesting that TAFA2 acts as a neurotrophic factor essential for neuronal survival and neurobiological functions (

Wang X. et al., 2018

). More recently, FAM19A2/TAFA-2 was found to regulate metabolic activities and food intake. Administration of FAM19A2/TAFA-2 to mice just before the initiation of dark period led to increased food intake and meal number, but reduced meal size (

Okada et al., 2019

). Outside the nervous system, TAFA2 was found to increase the migration and motility of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and to be involved with the recruitment of MSC to bone fracture sites. It was revealed that TAFA2 was able to promote MSC migration through activation of the Rac1-p38 pathway (

Jafari et al., 2019

). In addition, serum levels of TAFA2 in patients was also increased after hip fracture (

Jafari et al., 2019

). TAFA2 gene expression was found to be upregulated by interleukin-1β and during the inflammatory phase of fracture healing in mice (

Jafari et al., 2019

). The pleiotropy of TAFA2 therefore requires further investigation to uncover its diverse roles by a tissue-specific approach. Little is known about the function of TAFA3. For example, TAFA-3 appears to be a signalling molecule of the pars tuberalis, which is postulated to be a control centre of changing seasonal function rhythms (

Fischer et al., 2012

;

Korf, 2018

). Additionally, FAM19A3 was found to be upregulated in microglia of a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model

via

modulating the microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics and to ameliorate cerebral ischemia (

Shao et al., 2015

). Further research is needed to advance our knowledge and understanding of TAFA3 function.

TAFA5 has recently been implicated in the progression of cognitive impairment in vascular dementia patients and could be a vital regulator of depression (

Huang et al., 2020

;

Li et al., 2020

). TAFA5 was found to be predominantly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (

Paulsen et al., 2008

). Consistently, FAM19A5 was found to be highly expressed in the embryonic hippocampus (

Huang et al., 2020

). More recently, it was revealed that the hypothalamic expression of TAFA5/FAM19A5 was induced by TNF-α, thereby suggesting its involvement with inflammatory responses of the hypothalamus (

Kang et al., 2020

). Interestingly, FAM19A5 knockdown led to the reduction of TNF-α-induced anorexia and decreased loss of body weight, whereas administration of FAM19A5 by an intracerebroventricular route resulted in anorexia, body weight loss, hyperthermia, and the enhanced expression of inflammatory factors (

Kang et al., 2020

). Further, FAM19A5 administration also resulted in increases in the activation of c-fos and the expression of preproopiomelanocortin (POMC) in POMC neurons in hypothalamus, suggesting that FAM19A5 plays a part in inflammatory responses of the hypothalamus (

Kang et al., 2020

). Mice with FAM19A5 gene deletion demonstrated depressive-like behaviours and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, which was accompanied by decreased expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (

Huang et al., 2020

). Mice additionally showed reduced glutamate release and neuronal activity in the hippocampus, and the decreased density of dendritic spines (

Huang et al., 2020

). These data suggest that FAM19A5 regulates depression and spatial cognition

via

the hippocampus (

Huang et al., 2020

). In line with this finding, the serum FAM19A5 level of vascular dementia patients was found to be increased, suggestive of a role in cognitive impairment of vascular dementia patients (

Li et al., 2020

). Together, these findings indicate TAFA5 could be a critical regulator of cognitive function and warrants further research of its potential for diagnosis and treatment-based approaches of depression.

Beyond the nervous system, research indicates that downregulation of FAM19A5 during obesity could lead to the development of cardiometabolic diseases (

Wang Y. et al., 2018

). In this study, FAM19A5 was found to inhibit postinjury neointima formation

via

sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signalling (

Wang Y. et al., 2018

). In addition, serum FAM19A5 is postulated to be a biomarker of cardio-metabolic disease, as it was found to be positively correlated with risk factors, such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, alanine aminotransferase, fasting plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin and mean brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (

Lee et al., 2019

). Whereas in the skeletal system, FAM19A5 was found to inhibit osteoclastogenesis

via

FPR2, suggesting a role of TAFA family proteins in bone disorders (

Park et al., 2017

). The pleiotropy of TAFA5 therefore requires further investigation to elucidate the diverse roles of TAFA5 in a disease-specific based approach.

TAFA5 has also been implicated in cancers (

Diaz de Stahl et al., 2005

;

Hu et al., 2019

). TAFA5 was upregulated in gastric cancer cells compared with normal cells, which is correlated with unfavourable patient prognoses. Overexpression of TAFA5 in gastric cancer was associated with poor differentiation, tumour progression, nodal, and metastasis stages.

In vitro

findings showed that downregulation of TAFA5 could inhibit the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cell lines. Interestingly, TAFA5 expression was significantly correlated with genes found to be associated with epithelialmesenchymal transition, which is suggestive of TAFA5 involvement in the progression of gastric cancer (

Hu et al., 2019

). In addition, previous studies have found that TAFA5 was associated with DNA copy number alterations in gliomas but its role of in tumour development requires further investigation (

Diaz de Stahl et al., 2005

).

Summary

The TAFA family consists of five members TAFA1–5 (also known as FAM19A1–5). They act as secretory chemokine like ligands or neurokines and exhibit pleiotropic functions in various tissues. TAFA4 was first reported to have an analgesic role in pain relief (

Delfini et al., 2013

;

Reynders and Moqrich, 2015

). The TAFA4 gene is predominantly expressed in the CNS. As a secreted ligand, TAFA4 binds to cell surface receptor FPR1 or neurexin to mediate versatile physiological processes including food intake, learning and memory, behaviours, locomotor activity, pain relief, and synapse homeostasis. Substantial recent research has shown the effectiveness of TAFA4 for the alleviation of pain caused by mechanical injury, neuro-inflammatory disorders, and chemical or infectious stimuli. Further research is required to completely characterise the molecular mechanisms and cellular signalling pathways of TAFA4 for the development of therapeutic applications targeting a range of pathogenic conditions. Advancing knowledge of the selective expression, regulation, and diverse biological functions of TAFA4 and FAM19A members in a tissue tropism dependent manner will enable us to develop strategies to treat TAFA4 and FAM19A related disorders, such as spinal cord injury and neuropathic pain.

#### TAFA5 - Article 3: Genome-wide analysis in northern Chinese twins identifies twelve new susceptibility loci for pulmonary function
<Date>: 2024-12-30

<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Pulmonary function, a heritable trait that reflects the physiological state of the lungs and airways [

1

], declines with age [

2

]. It can be assessed by spirometry with three key metrics including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the FEV1/FVC ratio. Pulmonary function is a predictor of the incidence [

3

,

4

] and mortality [

5

,

6

] of cardiopulmonary diseases and is crucial for diagnosing and evaluating respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These lung diseases not only impair lung health but also contribute to the development of other diseases, including diabetes [

7

] and cardiovascular disease [

8

]. Therefore, understanding the underlying biological mechanisms and factors affecting pulmonary function is essential for the effective prevention and control of respiratory diseases.

Previous research based on family and twin studies has provided evidence that pulmonary function is influenced by genetic factors, with heritability estimates ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 [

9

,

10

]. Researchers have also sought to identify genetic loci associated with pulmonary function through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), which is an extremely effective method for identifying genetic loci associated with complex phenotypes or diseases [

11

]. To date, most GWASs related to pulmonary function have focused on European and American populations, identifying numerous genetic variants and genes, such as

HHIP

,

GPR126

,

FAM13A

,

AGER

,

GSTCD

, and

PRDM11

[

12

–

15

]. Additionally, GWAS involving Latin American and East Asian populations, including Koreans, Mongolians, Japanese and Chinese, have also identified genetic loci and genes related to pulmonary function, some of which overlap with those found in European and American populations (e.g.,

GPR126

[

16

],

FAM13A

[

17

],

AGER

[

18

]), while others are novel, such as

KCNE2

,

PPT2

, and

TTLL2

[

16

,

17

,

19

].

Although some previous GWAS have focused on pulmonary function in East Asian populations, sequencing data from the Northeast Asian Reference Database reveal that despite a shared genetic foundation, distinct ancestral components exist among Koreans, Mongolians, Japanese, and mainland East Asians [

20

]. To our knowledge, only one study conducted with participants from the China has identified 18 novel loci associated with pulmonary function [

21

]. Therefore, further GWAS on the Chinese population are essential to expand our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of pulmonary function across different ethnics [

22

] and to identify genetic variants associated with pulmonary function in the Chinese population. The twin-based GWAS design can excellently control population stratification and gene-environment correlation, identifying direct genetic effects [

23

]. Thus, in the current study, we conducted the GWAS based the Chinese twin samples to address specific genetic variants related to pulmonary function in Chinese populations.

Materials and methods

Sample

The twin samples were derived from Qingdao Twin Registry [

24

], and details of the sample recruitment procedure have been described in previous literatures [

25

]. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, lactating, or had incomplete measurement of pulmonary function; the incomplete co-twin pairs were also dropped. The final sample consisted of 139 complete dizygotic (DZ) pairs (278 adults, 141 male and 137 female pairs) with a median age of 49 years (ranging from 40 to 70 years). Informed signed consents were achieved for all participants. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Qingdao Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review Boards, following the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.

Pulmonary function, including FEV1 and FVC, both measured in liters, was assessed by the electronic hand-held spirometer (Micro 0102). The FEV1/FVC ratio was calculated by dividing FEV1 by FVC. Details of measurement procedure have been described in previous literatures [

26

]. The three pulmonary function indices were transformed by Blom’s formula for normality.

Genotyping, quality control, and imputation

Genomic DNA extracted from whole blood of DZ twins were genotyped using Infinium Omni2.5Exome-8v1.2 genotyping BeadChip platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, USA). Data from autosome and X chromosome were analyzed. Following quality control criteria [

27

,

28

], we included SNPs with locus missing < 0.05, calling rate > 0.98, minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 0.01, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)

p

-value > 1 × 10

− 4

.

Moreover, IMPUTE2 [

29

] software was used to impute the untyped SNPs based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) information by using 1,000 Genomes Project Phase 3 East Asian as the reference panel. The filter criteria for imputed SNPs were INFO > 0.8, MAF > 0.05, and HWE > 1 × 10

− 4

. A total of 7,405,822 SNPs were finally obtained.

GWAS analysis

SNP-based analyses

GEMMA [

30

] was used to perform the effect of pulmonary function indices on SNP genotypes, adjusting for age, sex, height, smoking status (never, ever, and now), the first five principle components, and the relatedness matrix. The common Bonferroni-corrected threshold (

p

< 5 × 10

− 8

) was set as genome-wide statistical significance, and the threshold (

p

< 1 × 10

− 5

) was considered for suggestive evidence level. Locus Zoom applied to display regional information of GWAS results. We submitted suggestively significant SNPs located in non-coding region to Enhancer DB to search which enhancer these SNPs were located in, to GTEx project portal (

https://www.gtexportal.org/home/

) (Accessed data: August 2023; Data Release: Version 8) to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) related to these SNPs, to SNP2TFBS to find which transcript factor these SNPs affect.

Gene-based analysis

We conducted gene-based analyses using the VEGAS2 [

31

] tool on GWAS summary data, with linkage disequilibrium accounted for using the Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) sub-population from the 1000 Genomes Project Asian Population. The analysis incorporated 26,056 unique VEGAS2 gene definitions, comprising 24,769 autosomal genes and 1,287 X-chromosomal genes. Significance thresholds were set at

p

< 1.92(0.05/26,056) × 10

− 6

for multiple testing adjustment, and

p

< 0.05 for suggestive significance.

Pathway enrichment analysis

We conducted pathway enrichment analysis using the PASCAL tool [

32

], which provides a library of 1077 pathways sourced from the KEGG, REACTOME, and BIOCARTA databases through the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB). In our analysis, we aggregated SNP

p

-values from GWAS, adjusting for linkage disequilibrium (LD), to compute gene scores. These scores were then used to calculate pathway scores based on the gene scores within each of the pathways identified from the library. The significance of the pathway enrichment was assessed using either chi-squared or empirical scoring methods. We established statistical significance with a Bonferroni-corrected emp-

p

< 4.64 (0.05/1077) × 10

− 5

, and set a nominal significance level at emp-

p

< 0.05.

Validation analysis

To confirm the associations, we obtained the phenotype and genotype data from the third release of UK Biobank data (

https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/

) with Applications ID: 95,715. FEV1 and FVC value were calculated from spirometry blow and FEV1/FVC was calculated by these two indicators. The details about data collection, genotyping, and imputation have been described elsewhere [

33

,

34

]. We restricted the validation sample to Chinese ethnic background (

n

= 1573). As the previous study described [

28

], the top SNPs were validated by linear regression analysis of the additive effect model, adjusting for age, sex, smoke status, height and the first 10 genetic PCs. A total of 352 SNPs for FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC with

p

values < 1 × 10

− 5

in the discovery set were typed in the UKB data set and selected for validation. The Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was

p

< 1.42 × 10

− 4

(0.05/352), and the nominal significance level was

p

< 0.05. Figure

1

showed the outline of overall study design and analysis steps. Moreover, we used the 12 identified susceptibility loci associated with pulmonary function to construct a polygenic risk score (PRS). Each SNP was weighted according to its effect size derived from the UK Biobank validation results. These weights were then applied to the corresponding SNPs in our target population (twin pairs) to calculate the cumulative PRS for each individual. Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess the association between the computed PRS and pulmonary function, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and height. Statistical analyses were performed utilizing R version 4.2.0. The code used in this study can be accessed at the following GitHub repository:

. Our study included 139 dizygotic twin pairs, with a median age of 49 years. The median level (interquartile range) pulmonary function values were 2.06 (0.97) for FEV1, 2.19(0.90) for FVC, and 0.97(0.10) for FEV1/FVC.

SNPs-based genome-wide association study

The association between pulmonary function and SNP genotypes was evaluated using the GEMMA software. The quantile-quantile plot (Fig.

2

) illustrates the relationship between the observed and expected GWAS

p

-values. The deviation of points towards the upper right corner of the QQ plot in our results suggests the presence of significant genetic associations related to pulmonary function. The low level of genomic inflation factor (λ) ranging from 0.997 to 1.007 indicates no evidence of population stratification effects. As the Manhattan plot shows in Fig.

3

SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level for FEV1, and 222 SNPs for FEV1, 150 SNPs for FVC, 73 SNPs for FEV1/FVC reached suggestive association level (

displays the top 20 SNPs for pulmonary function. Among the top SNPs for FEV1, three SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance level, including rs80345886 and rs117883876 (

p

= 8.45 × 10

− 10

) near

MTHFD2P6

gene, and rs75139439 located in the

PARM1

gene (

p

= 2.31 × 10

− 9

). In addition, three SNPs (rs34982522, rs78238888, and rs78628444,

p

= 5.88 × 10

− 8

) were located in the enh8386(chr5: 14,024,025 − 14,042,149) region, which regulates

DNAH5

gene. Seven SNPs, including rs4723047 (

p

= 8.25 × 10

− 8

) at

ADCYAP1R1

gene on chromosome 7p14.3, were illustrated in the locus zoom plots (Supplementary Metarial

: Figure

). For FVC, the strongest associated SNP was rs9403380 (

p

= 1.27 × 10

− 7

) in the

GPR126

gene. Nine other SNPs in the

GPR126

gene located on chromosome 6q24.1, are shown in the locus zoom plots (Supplementary Metarial

4

: Figure

S2

). As shown in Figure

S2

, there was no LD between the nine SNPs and rs9403380, suggesting that these SNPs might independently affect FVC. For FEV1/FVC, including the strongest associated SNP rs61918244 (

p

= 2.86 × 10

− 7

), 14 SNPs were located in enh14492 (chr12: 6,369,425-6,399,675) and enh14493 (chr12: 6,399,825-6,409,255), which regulates the

PLEKHG6

gene. Supplementary Metarial

gene in lung tissues (

p

= 4.90 × 10

, m-value = 0.934), and rs4950744 (

p

gene in lung tissues (

= 1.30 × 10

Gene based analysis

The results of gene-based analysis by VEGAS2 showed that no gene reached the genome-wide significance level (

p

< 1.92 × 10

− 6

). However, 698 genes for FEV1,724 genes for FVC, and 355 genes for FEV1/FVC ratio exceeded the suggestive evidence level (

p

< 0.05), as shown in Supplementary Material

2

: Table

S3

. The top 20 genes for each of the three pulmonary function indicators, ranked by

P

values, are shown in Table

2

.

ADCYAP1R1

for FEV1 and FVC,

CPR126

for FVC, and

CCDC110

for FEV1/FVC had already been shown in the top 20 SNP annotated genes, whereas the other genes were novel, including

TBC1D16

,

FKBP5

,

AQP4

,

RPL37

, and

CD1B

.

Pathway enrichment analysis

Pathway enrichment analysis identified 582, 540, and 633 pathways (emp-

p

< 0.05) associated with FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively. The top 20 pathways ranked by empirical

p

-value for FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio are shown in Table

3

. For FEV1, significant pathways included signaling by NGF, olfactory signaling pathway, purine metabolism, P53 signaling pathway, and HIF pathway. For FVC, significant pathways included the PI3K cascade, FGFR signaling relevant pathway including negative regulation of FGFR signaling, FGFR ligand binding and activation. For FEV1/FVC, significant pathways included signaling to ERKS, NTHI pathway, WNT pathway, MET pathway, aquaporin mediated transport, etc. Additionally, 268 pathways were common to FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC, including signaling by NGF, insulin signaling pathway, and aquaporin mediated transport (Supplementary Material

3

: Table

Validation analysis

A total of 352 SNPs for the three pulmonary function indicators with

p

< 1 × 10

− 5

in the discovery set were genotyped in the UK Biobank validation set and selected for validation. Although no SNP passed the Bonferroni correction threshold (

p

< 1.42 × 10

− 4

), six SNPs for FEV1 and FVC, and six SNPs for FEV1 exceeded the nominal significance level (

p

< 0.05). Compared to results published in the GWAS catalog, the 12 SNPs related to pulmonary function validated in this study are all novel. Two SNPs (rs10871500 and rs8070465) were located in the

TBC1D16

gene, one (rs149612364) in the

TAFA5

gene, and one (rs507108) in the

MTHFD1L

gene (Table

). After adjusting for confounders, the GEE models indicated that the PRS was positively associated with FEV1 and FVC, with regression coefficients (β) of 1.49 (

p

< 0.001) and 1.33 (

p

< 0.001), respectively.

Discussion

In this study, we conducted a GWAS of pulmonary function in northern Chinese twins. We identified 222 SNPs associated with FEV1, 150 SNPs associated with FVC, and 73 SNPs associated with the FEV1/FVC ratio, all of which reached a suggestive level of association. Among these, we corroborated the involvement of 52 SNPs located in 14 genes, including

[

], and

[

], as supported by previous studies. Additionally, we validated 12 novel SNPs associated with pulmonary function in an independent UK Biobank cohort, with some located in the

TBC1D16

,

TAFA5

, and

MTHFD1L

genes. Gene-based and pathway enrichment analyses further identified hundreds of suggestively significant associations involving genes and pathways across FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, underscoring the complex genetic architecture underlying pulmonary function traits.

In this study, we identified 222, 150, and 73 SNPs associated with FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively, that reached suggestive significance levels. For FEV1, three SNPs located in enhancers were found to regulate the transcription of the

DNAH5

gene. This gene, previously associated with ciliary defects [

38

,

40

,

44

], was linked to FEV1 in our study. Additionally, two SNPs near the lesser-studied

MTHFD2P6

pseudogene and one at the

PARM1

gene, which may influence airway epithelium maintenance and repair [

45

], reached genome-wide significance. For FVC, 11 highly correlated SNPs within the

GPR126

gene showed significant associations.

GPR126

, previously identified in GWAS studies as related to pulmonary function [

16

,

46

,

47

], is crucial for lung development [

48

] and may influence cell proliferation and airway remodeling [

49

]. Several SNPs located the

ADCYAP1R1

gene showed associations with both FEV1 and FVC. This gene is widely distributed in airway nerve fibers and has significant anti-inflammatory and protective functions in the lungs [

50

,

51

]. For the FEV1/FVC ratio, 14 SNPs in enhancers regulating the

PLEKHG6

gene reached suggestive significance. Animal studies suggest that

PLEKHG6

may contribute to lung protection against hypercapnia [

52

], and methylation of

PLEKHG6

CpG sites, associated with NO2 exposure, may mediate the effects of air pollution on pulmonary function [

53

].

During the validation phase in the UK Biobank Chinese cohort, 12 novel SNPs were found to be nominally significant for lung function, including two in the

TBC1D16

gene, one in the

TAFA5

gene, and one in the

MTHFD1L

gene.

TBC1D16

is a GTPase-activating protein that regulates Rab GTPases [

54

], influencing cell migration and growth, which may be related to alveolar development [

55

,

56

]. The

TAFA5

gene, previously associated with wheezing [

57

], which is the symptomatic manifestation of diseases that cause airway obstruction, also inhibits post-injury neointima formation [

58

] and may influence lung function. The

MTHFD1L

-encoded protein is involved in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate in mitochondria, which could impact lung tissue repair and regeneration, and has been associated with lung function [

39

,

59

]. Additionally, six SNPs located in non-coding regions suggest that these sites may represent functional coding variants or regulatory elements, warranting further exploration.

The gene-based analysis found 698, 724, and 355 genes exceeding the suggestive significance level for FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively. Some of these genes, such as

GPR126

,

TBC1D16

, and

ADCYAP1R1

, have been discussed above. Several genes of these genes might play a role in pulmonary function through the following mechanisms.

FKBP51

encodes a major component of the glucocorticoid receptor and regulates its response to corticosteroids [

60

]. Glucocorticoids are involved in late fetal lung development and intrauterine lung maturation in humans [

61

,

62

].

AQP4

encodes an aquaporins expressed in large- and small-airway epithelia, and

AQP4

deletion affects lung water permeability [

63

].

RPL37

, as a component of the 60 S ribosomes subunit, is a target gene of miR-4516 and forms the miR-4516/RPL37 pathway, which is involved in autophagy. This pathway plays a critical role in the cellular response to PM2.5 and metal components, potentially affecting pulmonary function [

64

].

CD1B

is a lipid-presenting protein that may be influenced by the sphingosine pathway, which is relevant to COPD and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases [

65

].

Pathway enrichment analysis identified several biological pathways significantly associated with pulmonary function: 582 pathways for FEV1, 540 pathways for FVC, and 633 pathways for FEV1/FVC. Some of these pathways are biologically plausible. Signaling by nerve growth factor (NGF) was associated with FEV1 and FVC. As a member of the neurotrophin family, NGF is highly expressed in the lungs and can change protein expression levels and mediate cellular function, impacting the development of lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and asthma [

66

]. Olfactory signaling pathway and olfactory transduction were also related to FEV1 and FVC [

67

]. Notably, olfactory transduction was the most significant KEGG pathway in a previous GWAS of pulmonary function in Koreans [

68

]. WNT pathway was related to FEV1/FVC and is essential for proper lung development [

69

,

70

]. Additionally, WNT signaling pathway has been revealed in asthma pathogenesis in previous GWASs [

68

,

71

]. Besides these plausible pathways, other pathways might also have biological associations with pulmonary function. More studies need to be conducted to verify these associations.

This study has several advantages. First, our study, based on Qingdao twin samples, provides valuable genetic evidence for the East Asian population. This contrasts with previous pulmonary function GWAS, which were conducted primarily on European populations. Second, we performed the pulmonary function GWAS in twin pairs. The twin-based GWAS approach effectively controls population stratification and passive gene-environment correlations due to the shared genetic and environmental factors of twins. This methodology enhances the accuracy of genetic association studies by enabling the detection of direct genetic effects [

23

], while simultaneously reducing the risk of false positives and clarifying indirect genetic influences.

However, our study still has some limitations. First, the relatively small sample size of our study may limit the ability to detect significant associations between genetic markers and pulmonary function, largely due to the difficulty in recruiting and identifying qualified twin samples. More studies are needed to confirm our results. Second, although 12 suggestive SNPs were identified and validated in our study, none reached the statistically significant level. Further research is necessary to validate these potential candidate biomarkers of pulmonary function. Third, since our sample is based on a limited number of Han Chinese twins from the Qingdao region, the generalizability of our findings may be constrained. Future studies with more diverse populations and larger sample sizes are needed to validate the broader applicability of our results.

In conclusion, we identified and validated 12 novel SNPs associated with pulmonary function, including those located in the

TBC1D16

,

TAFA5

, and

MTHFD1L

genes. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic factors influencing pulmonary function and highlight potential biomarkers for future investigation. While these SNPs show promise, further studies are needed to confirm their roles and explore their potential as candidate biomarkers for pulmonary function.

#### TAFA5 - Article 4: Can Adipokine FAM19A5 Be a Biomarker of Metabolic Disorders?
<Date>: 2024-4-10

<Full Text Content>:
Visceral Adipose Tissue

Adipose tissue, in addition to its energy storage function, is a vital endocrine organ. It also protects against heat loss and mechanical injuries. One of the most critical functions of adipose tissue is the production of adipokines, ie, numerous active substances that regulate metabolism. Both excess and deficiency of adipose tissue negatively affect health. Overall mortality, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and obesity are related to body fat content. Visceral fat tissue is particularly metabolically active.

1

The essential component of adipose tissue is adipocytes, scattered within the skeleton formed by collagen fibers. There is a subpopulation in adipose tissue stem cells called stromal vascular fraction cells (SVF) and preadipocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. All these elements influence the metabolic function of adipose tissue, regardless of its morphological type. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the largest body store of energy, accumulated in triglycerides (TG), and is the largest endocrine gland—brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions to generate thermal energy, mainly in children. Pink adipose tissue is involved in milk production in women during pregnancy and lactation. Depending on the location of fat tissue in the body, it is divided into subcutaneous and visceral. Subcutaneous adipocytes are large and less metabolically active, while visceral adipocytes are small and more active. Visceral tissue is more metabolically active and secretes more hormone-like substances. Its increased content in obesity significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

The summary of fat tissue’s function is presented in

Figure 1

.

Figure 1

Function of fat tissue in the human body.

8

Malnutrition and, consequently, too low body fat content may result in improper functioning of organs and, in children, growth retardation.

5

Obesity is a significant problem for the public health worldwide, because it has become an epidemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1 billion people worldwide have obesity — 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children.

6

,

7

Assessing the concentration of body fat makes it possible to assess a person’s nutritional status and plan an appropriate nutrition plan, and in the case of obesity - to plan appropriate treatment. The simplest method of estimating overweight and obesity is to measure waist circumference (WC) and calculate the waist-hip ratio (WHR). These indicators are more effective in estimating the risk of cardiovascular diseases than assessing body weight based on body mass index (BMI). The most popular method of estimating body fat content is to perform a body composition analysis using the bioelectrical impedance method. The result is given in kilograms and %. The correct body fat percentage in women is 20–30%, while in men, it is 10–20% of the total body weight. Values exceeding 32% and 26% in women and men indicate obesity. More accurate methods for assessing body fat are computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and double-beam X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

Improper nutrition, lack of physical activity, increased stress, certain medications, and psychological and social factors may increase the risk of obesity. Obesity treatment includes permanent changes in eating habits and lifestyle, increasing physical activity, and health and nutrition education. Pharmacological treatment should be tailored to the patient’s capabilities and comorbidities. Available substances approved for treating obesity include tetrahydrolipstatin, bupropion hydrochloride, naltrexone hydrochloride, and liraglutide. Obesity treatment can also be supported by individual physiotherapy and psychological support.

9–11

Obesity causes several health consequences. It increases the risk of, among others, stroke, cataracts, coronary heart disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis, infertility, osteoarthritis, and cancer.

12

All of this conditions are mainly related to chronic inflammation induced by excess fat tissue.

Inflammation is a protective response to tissue damage or destruction. Short-term treatment destroys or dilutes both the damaging agent and the damaged tissues. However, long-term inflammation has a destructive effect on human health. This condition occurs in people with obesity. It is characterized by lymphocytes and macrophages as well as proliferation of blood vessels and connective tissue. Chronic inflammation is caused by excess fat tissue in these people. The induction and continuation of inflammation are influenced by the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines by adipose tissue. These include interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). IL-6 stimulates hepatocytes to synthesize and secrete c-reactive protein (CRP). Moreover, the accumulation of free fatty acids in obesity activates pro-inflammatory serine kinase cascades. These include IκB kinase (IKK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNKs), which stimulate adipose tissue to release IL-6. Elevated CRP may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction. Increasing the concentration of IL-6 and TNF-α inhibits and reduces the synthesis and secretion of adiponectin. Reducing the adiponectin concentration increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Persistent inflammation is a decisive risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cancer. Increased adipose tissue content regulates the secretion of adipokines.

13–15

New adipokines that may be the best biomarkers in metabolic disorders are still being sought.

Adipokines in Obesity

Adipokines are proteins secreted by adipose tissue. These proteins influence glucose and lipid metabolism. They regulate the feeling of hunger and satiety and maintain metabolic homeostasis. Their concentrations influence the concentrations of other substances, including hormones. They influence neuroendocrine and immune functions. WAT secretes, among others, leptin, omentin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, vaspin, hepcidin, chemerin, TNF-α, monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP-4) and plasminogen.

16

Adipsin was discovered as the first adipokine in 1987.

17

However, the discovery of leptin produced by mature adipocytes in 1994 increased interest in the presence of adipokines and their functions in metabolism.

18

The functions of selected adipokines in the human body are presented in

The role of many adipokines still needs to be clarified, or the results of studies are contradictory. Such adipokines include the newly discovered Family With Sequence Similarity 19 Member A5 protein (FAM19A5), which another, older name is TAFA-5.

Metabolic Syndrome

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of comorbidities that include obesity, hypertension, and disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, the latest definition of MetS from 2022 suggests that it should be diagnosed as obesity comorbid with two of the following criteria - high blood pressure, impaired glucose metabolism, and increased cholesterol concentration in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (atherogenic dyslipidemia). Obesity can be diagnosed based on Body Mass Index (BMI) or waist circumference. The population of MetS patients is not homogeneous. This is due to two or three of the above disorders accompanying obesity, which generate various combinations of pathologies occurring in each person.

26

MetS is a major clinical problem, and its incidence is increasing in Poland. According to the Multi-centre National Population Health Examination Study (WOBASZ), 2014, MetS was 33% and 39% in women and men aged 20–74, respectively. This result increased by almost 3% and 9% in women and men, respectively, compared to the WOBASZ study 2003.

6

,

27

Globally, almost 25% have MetS. Epidemiological studies highlight the problem of the increasing number of people with MetS worldwide. The increase is particularly noticeable among children and adolescents, which coincides with the increase in the number of children with obesity.

28

Obesity is considered a core element of MetS. Excessive accumulation of fat tissue and the resulting activity of visceral fat tissue causes over 200 complications. MetS consequently causes impaired kidney function, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, and hyperuricemia. MetS also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and vascular disease and increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Obesity and MetS are associated with increased oxidative stress, essential in the pathogenesis of comorbidities that may develop during MetS. Furthermore, the component of the MetS that contributes most to the relationship between metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress is the component related to obesity and insulin resistance. The essential treatment for MetS is lifestyle change, increasing physical activity, stopping smoking, and changing eating habits, along with pharmacological treatment. These changes consequently cause weight loss, visceral fat tissue reduction, and reduction in the concentration of pro-inflammatory adipokines, especially from visceral adipose tissue.

28

FAM19A5 Original Direction of Research

Family With Sequence Similarity 19 Member A5 protein (FAM19A5), another older name is TAFA-5, and it is one of five proteins encoded by the TAFA1-TAFA5 genes. FAM19A5 is less related to other TAFA family proteins. This protein exhibits the characteristics of an adipokine with positive features for maintaining homeostasis.

29

Wang et al in 2018 showed that FAM19A5 is an adipokine. The authors analyzed the expression profile of a panel of human cDNAs from multiple tissues. The results showed that FAM19A5 was highly expressed in adipose tissue, with mild to moderate expression in the brain and ovary, and was barely detectable in other tissues. Detailed results also showed FAM19A5 expression in humans in subcutaneous, perirenal adipose tissue. FAM19A5 was also detected in the epididymal adipose tissue of mice. The secretion of this protein by fat cells of various origins was also compared in humans and mice. According to the authors, FAM19A5 was primarily secreted by rat epididymal adipocytes compared to other cell types, including the vascular fraction of adipose tissue, primary rat adventitial aortic fibroblasts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, rat and human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), as well as primary mouse peritoneal macrophages. The same project also demonstrated the protective effect of FAM19A5. Adipose tissue-derived FAM19A5 inhibited neointimal formation after in vivo injury in mice, and circulating FAM19A5 levels negatively correlated with neointimal formation. Moreover, the authors suggest that FAM19A5 may also inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration through the perivascular adipose tissue paracrine pathway.

29

FAM19A5 contributes to the wound healing process after brain injury,

30

and also participates in receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) induced differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells through interactions with the N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2).

31

In humans, serum levels of FAM19A5 were decreased in obese children compared with healthy controls. Moreover, there are negative correlations between FAM19A5 and BMI and fasting insulin. These results suggest an association of the FAM19A5 protein with metabolic disorders and emphasize its suggested positive effects on the body.

32

The first data on FAM19A5 genes comes from 2004. Y. Tom Tang et al then discovered a family of small secreted proteins in

Homo sapiens

and

Mus musculus

. The family consisted of five highly homologous genes. They were referred to as TAFA-1 to −5. This study used a method of identifying new gene families, which was new in 2004, encoding proteins secreted non-transmembranely. The authors showed that the TAFA genes 1 to 4 are more closely related to each other than to TAFA-5. This was demonstrated by comparing nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The study looked for the proteins encoded by these genes, but the state of knowledge still needed to be improved. TAFA-2 expression level was low. TAFA-1, TAFA-3, TAFA-4, and TAFA-5 proteins were detected in culture supernatants. The expression of these genes was also studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression has been studied in the brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lungs, spleen, and thymus. All TAFA genes are expressed at different levels in the brain and deficient levels in other tissues. According to the authors, genes from the TAFA family are expressed mainly in the central nervous system.

33

The TAFA-5 protein discovered in 2004 will, in the future, be called the FAM19A5 protein.

A year later, in 2005, genes from the TAFA family became the object of interest of Teresita Díaz de Ståhl1 et al. The team identified areas of loss or gain on chromosome 22, either constitutional or cancer-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which could indicate the position of putative genes involved in glioblastoma development. A high-resolution tiling-path chromosome 22 array to a series of 50 glioblastoma samples to investigate the underlying abnormalities in both constitutional and tumor-derived DNA. Analysis of the amplified regions revealed the presence of two interesting candidate genes: TOP3B and TAFA-5. It was shown that this gene encodes a protein, which was then named TAFA-5 - like the gene’s name. According to the authors, the TAFA family proteins are distantly related and contain conserved cysteine residues at fixed positions. They belong to chemokines. According to the authors, the TOP3B and TAFA-5 genes may be involved in the genesis of glioblastoma.

34

Until 2018, the topic of TAFA genes was not discussed. At that time, links between the TAFA-5 (FAM19A5) protein and disorders, including metabolic disorders, were sought.

In 2018, Anna A. Kashevarova et al checked the genetic analysis of a 4-year-old girl with a terminal deletion at 22q13. The girl showed developmental delays, hyperactivity, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. The array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) results were confirmed by real-time PCR in three tissues: lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts, and oral epithelium. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to confirm the ring form of chromosome 22 and to determine the level of cells with monosomy 22 among skin lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Real-time PCR confirmed the presence of microdeletions with primers for the FAM19A5 (TAFA-5) gene, SHANK3, and ACR genes. According to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, the 22q13.32-q13.33 microdeletion occurred de novo on the mother’s chromosome. The above results suggest a link between the FAM19A5 gene and the Phelan-McDermid syndrome described in girl.

35

After the discovery of TAFA genes in 2004, interest in FAM19A5 (TAFA-5) functions has been most noticeable in neurology, neurological and psychiatric diseases.

FAM19A5 – Central Nervous System

Referring to a 2004 paper where only limited information was available on FAM19A5 function in the brain,

33

Anu Shahapal et al wished to determine the expression pattern of FAM19A5 during embryogenesis and in the adult brain and to identify the types of brain cells that express FAM19A5 in FAM19A5-LacZ knock-in (KI) mice. In the results, FAM19A5-LacZ KI homozygous mice showed more vital X-gal staining than heterozygous mice. Moreover, global X-gal staining in embryonic stages showed dominant expression of FAM19A5 in the brain and spinal cord. In adult mice, FAM19A5 was widely expressed in multiple brain regions. Interestingly, increased FAM19A5 expression was shown in response to traumatic brain injury. The authors concluded that FAM19A5 is a crucial regulator of central nervous system (CNS) development and the brain’s response to injury.

30

Already a year earlier, in 2018, Can Zheng showed that FAM19A5 protein expression levels correlate with brain development. The FAM19A5 protein has been shown to function during embryonic brain development by promoting neuronal differentiation and suppressing astrocyte differentiation. Despite this, the full function of the FAM19A5 protein in the brain needed clarification to the authors.

36

Research on the effect of FAM19A5 in the CNS was continued. A case report from 2019, which presented a female fetus with schizencephaly accompanied by cerebro-occipital hernia, polymicrogyria, agenesis of the corpus callosum, facial dysmorphia, and ventricular septal defect in the myocardium, showed a deletion of chromosome 22q13.32, including the FAM19A5 gene. The authors suggested that the presence of the FAM19A5 gene could be associated with the development of schizencephaly.

37

In the same year, Anna J Khalaj’s team demonstrated that FAM19A functions as cell type-specific regulators of neurexin modification in the nervous system. FAM19A1-A4 binds to the cysteine loop domain of neurotoxins, forming intermolecular disulfide bonds during transport through the secretory pathway. According to the authors, FAM19A serves as cell type-specific regulators of neurexin modification, which is associated with disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and mental retardation.

38

Moreover, FAM19A5 protein deficiency in mice showed hyperactive locomotor behavior, long-term memory deficits, and failure to acquire fear. These results suggest that FAM19A5 influences the nervous system’s development and the mature brain’s proper functioning.

39

It was also checked whether the concentration of FAM19A5 protein correlated with the severity of vascular dementia. The study included 136 patients with vascular dementia and 81 healthy controls. The results showed that serum FAM19A5 concentration was significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, Spearman correlation analysis showed that serum FAM19A5 levels significantly correlate negatively in patients with vascular dementia (r = −0.414, <0.001). Based on the results, the authors suggest that FAM19A5 protein concentration may be a biomarker for predicting cognitive function in patients with vascular dementia.

40

Hye Lim Lee et al checked whether FAM19A5 concentrations correlate with the optic neuritis spectrum disorder. The study included blood sera from 199 patients from 11 hospitals over 21 months. Patients were divided into neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders with positive aquaporin-4 antibody (NMOSD-AQP4), other CNS demyelinating diseases, and healthy controls. In the results, serum FAM19A5 concentration was higher in patients with NMOSD-AQP4 and correlated with clinical characteristics. According to the authors, serum FAM19A5 may be a new clinical biomarker for NMOSD-AQP4.

41

In 2020, it was shown for the first time that FAM19A5 concentrations are associated with depressive states in mice. Genetic deletion of FAM19A5 resulted in increased depressive behavior and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory in mice. FAM19A5 levels in the plasma and hippocampus of chronic stress-treated mice were significantly reduced, whereas overexpression of human FAM19A5 selectively in the hippocampus may attenuate chronic stress-induced depressive behavior. This study provided a new mechanism for chronic stress-induced depression. It has been shown that FAM19A5 may be a new biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment strategy of depression.

42

Kyu-Man Han et al in 2020 confirmed that serum FAM19A5 may be a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans. The study included 52 previously untreated patients with MDD and 60 healthy controls. Serum FAM19A5 levels were significantly higher in MDD patients than in the healthy controls group. According to the authors, serum FAM19A5 levels may reflect reactive astrogliosis and associated neuroinflammation in MDD.

43

Another study from 2021 checked whether the concentration of FAM19A5 protein changed after administration of cilostazol (phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor as an adjunctive to antidepressants) (CLS) in patients with MDD. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. Inhibition of PDE3 activity leads to an increase in cAMP concentration in blood platelets and smooth muscles of blood vessels, inhibiting platelet aggregation and dilating blood vessels. The study included 80 participants with MDD. They were given cilostazol 50 mg or placebo twice daily plus escitalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) (ESC) 20 mg once daily for six weeks. Serum FAM19A5 concentrations were statistically significantly lower in the CLS group compared to the placebo group after the end of drug administration. According to the authors, FAM19A5 may be clinically helpful in assessing antidepressant response.

44

Also, in 2021, FAM19A5 was investigated to be associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Parkinson’s disease with depression (PDD). Plasma FAM19A5 levels (2.456 ± 0.517) were shown to be significantly higher in the PD group compared to the control group (2.23 ± 0.457) (P < 0.001). Importantly, plasma FAM19A5 concentration was also significantly higher in the PDD subgroup (2.577 ± 0.408) compared with the nondepressed subgroup (2.406 ± 0.549) (P = 0.045 < 0.05). The authors suggest that plasma FAM19A5 may serve as potential tools for early prediction of PD and PDD in clinical settings.

45

The use of FAM19A5 in preventing, diagnosing, or treating central nervous system injuries, degenerative brain diseases, or central nervous system diseases seems promising.

FAM19A5 in Oncological Diseases

The discovery of FAM19A5 increased interest in the function of this protein in oncology. Tavan Janvilisri et al in 2015 tested new serum biomarkers for differentiating cholangiocarcinoma from benign biliary tract diseases. Using a proteomic approach, Tavan Janvilisri et al tested new serum biomarkers for differentiating cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) from benign biliary tract disease (BBTD). At that time, the available tumor markers, including CA19-9 and CEA, were ineffective and had limited use due to low sensitivity and specificity. Serum samples from 19 CCA and 17 BBTD patients were used. Five of the most essential proteins were found that showed the maximum fold change between CCA and BBTD. It included MAGED4B, KIAA0321, RBAK, and UPF3B, as well as the TAFA5 protein, which was first named as FAM19A5. According to the authors, these proteins, including FAM19A5, will be clinically helpful in preventing misdiagnosis between CCA and BBTD as they have similar clinical manifestations.

46

In the same year, the study by Zhiqing Hu et al evaluated the clinical and prognostic significance of TAFA5 in 90 human gastric cancer (GC) samples and the in vitro activity of TAFA5 in cultured gastric cancer cells. TAFA5 was upregulated in GC compared to adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, TAFA5 overexpression in GCs was associated with poor differentiation and poorer tumor, lymph node, and metastasis stages. In addition, high TAFA5 expression was correlated with poor patient outcomes. The authors suggest that TAFA5 has a significant effect on GC progression.

47

The study by Yan-Fang Wang et al from 2020 included 25 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), one of modern oncology’s significant challenges. The mean serum FAM19A5 concentration in MCL patients was significantly higher than in the control group (P=0.0461). FAM19A5 expression in serum and lymph nodes showed a significant correlation (r=0.8683, P=0.001). Moreover, the mean recurrence/death-free survival of MCL patients with high, intermediate, and low FAM19A5 expression was 17, 27, and 37.5 months, respectively, which showed a significant statistical difference (P=0.0360). The conclusions suggest that FAM19A5 expression levels are increased in MCL patients, and patients with high FAM19A5 expression are at increased risk of disease relapse or death. According to the authors, FAM19A5 may be a new prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for MCL.

48

The 2022 study by Shoujing Luan et al aimed to investigate whether FAM19A5 could be a new target in diagnostics and prognostic in patients with thyroid cancer. It was observed that FAM19A5 levels were increased in thyroid cancer. FAM19A5 was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in thyroid cancer patients. According to the authors, FAM19A5 may serve as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer.

49

Although the concentration of FAM19A5 is higher in patients with selected oncological diseases, there is still no information on the importance of this protein as a tumor marker.

FAM19 – Other Research Directions

In addition to research on the association of the FAM19A5 protein with nervous system disorders and cancer, its other functions in the pathophysiology of diseases were also searched for. In 2017, MinYoung Park et al demonstrated that FAM19A5 strongly stimulates murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), causing chemotactic migration and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis induced by the receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) gene. The authors suggest that FAM19A5 and its target N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) may act as a novel endogenous ligand/receptor negatively regulating osteoclastogenesis.

31

In the same year, in nephron progenitor cells, a DNA region in intron 2 of the Wnt9b FAM19A5 target gene was identified and shown to be physically related to β-catenin. Whether this element could act as a cell type-specific enhancer in mice and humans was tested. Although in multiple contexts, Myc is a target of β-catenin, authors’ characterization of a cell type-specific enhancer for the Wnt9b/β-catenin target gene Fam19a5 shows that Myc and β-catenin cooperate to activate gene expression controlled by this element.

50

Moreover, Yanfang Wang et al demonstrated that the FAM19A5/S1PR1 signaling pathway regulates mantle cell lymphoma viability and proliferation.

51

N Sevane et al looked for reasons for the rapid livestock adaptation to extreme climatic conditions. They compared the methylomes of two Creole cattle breeds living in tropical environments with their putative Spanish ancestors. They wanted to understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the rapid adaptation of a domestic species to a new and more physiologically challenging environment. Candidate genes involved in adaptation processes in tropical areas have been revealed, including genes variously hyper- or hypomethylated above 80% in Creole samples showing biological features and functions related to the immune response, including the FAM19A5 gene. These data suggested the need for further research on the influence of this gene in disease resistance and the improvement of cattle productivity and welfare.

52

In 2022, it was checked whether there is a link between FAM19A5 and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). A total of 344 patients with recent small subcortical infarction (RSSI) and 265 healthy controls were included in the study. FAM19A5 was highly expressed in the RSSI group (P = 0.023), showing a positive correlation with cerebral infarct volume (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher FAM19A5 levels reflect better outcomes in patients with RSSI. According to the authors, increased FAM19A5 levels are associated with cerebral small vessel disease and lead to better treatment outcomes.

53

Data on the association of FAM19A5 with physiology and other disorders still need to be made more explicit. There needs to be more information. A summary of data on the importance of FAM19A5 in physiology and metabolic disorders is presented in

Research on the relationship between FAM19A5 concentration and CNS functions or disorders has increased interest in the influence of FAM19A5 protein and energy homeostasis and metabolic disorders.

FAM19A5 - Metabolic Disorders

The role of different type of adipokines in metabolic disturbances for eg MetS is in the great interest among researchers all around the word. Each passing year brings about a deepening understanding of the mechanism underlying the function of adipokines such a leptin, visfatin, resistin and apelin (

Table 1

). Currently the search for a cause and effect relationship between FAM expression and the occurrence of metabolic disorders is still ongoing. The functions of this protein are still unclear and have been the subject of interest in several works. Undoubtedly, the influence of the tested protein on the centers responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis in the CNS, mainly the hypothalamus, probably plays an important role. In the meantime, clinical studies began to appear looking for a connection between FAM19A5 and metabolic disorders.

For the first time this relationship in 2008, Sarah Juel Paulsen et al showed that neuropeptide TAFA5 is expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and is regulated by dehydration. New genes involved in the hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis in rats were sought. The distribution of TAFA5 mRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative PCR on a rat cDNA tissue library. Previous reports confirmed that TAFA5 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system. Additionally, TAFA5 mRNA is highly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which binds vasopressin and oxytocin in magno- and paracellular neurons. It was also checked whether fasting or dehydration can affect TAFA5 mRNA levels. The results showed that TAFA5 mRNA was explicitly down-regulated in the PVN following water deprivation. The authors showed the need for further research because the significance of the TAFA5 protein remained unclear and unconfirmed.

54

In the same year, the team of Jana Bundzikova et al cited previous results on the TAFA5 gene and protein in a review where reports on the response of substances co-expressed in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons to osmotic challenges in normal and Brattleboro rats.

60

Knowledge about the function and function of the TAFA5 gene and protein remained unclear in 2008.

60

The functions of FAM19A5 were further searched. Dasol Kang et al in 2020 showed that FAM19A5 was expressed in mouse hypothalamic cells expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and in microglia. Moreover, TNF-α, which induces inflammatory responses in the disease, significantly increases FAM19A5 expression in the hypothalamus. Additionally, inhibition of FAM19A5 expression reduced TNF-α-induced anorexia, body weight loss, and TNF-α-induced inflammatory factor expression in mice. The authors concluded that FAM19A5 plays an essential role in hypothalamic inflammatory responses. This suggested the connection of the FAM19A5 protein with the feeling of hunger and satiety also.

61

Hoyun Kwak et al 2020 examined FAM19A5 protein levels and their gene expression in mice’s central and peripheral nervous system and peripheral tissues. In the results, total FAM19A5 levels in the central and peripheral nervous system were higher than in any peripheral tissues. They were also higher than the levels in adipose tissue. These results also emphasize the need to understand the detailed functions of the FAM19A5 protein in the nervous system and adipose tissue.

59

In 2019, B. An et al wanted to identify candidate genes for the organism measurement features of beef cattle 463 Wagyu (n = 463 animals). In addition to FAM19A5, 11 genes have been discovered. From this, the FAM19A5 gene was considered a novel candidate gene associated with body dimensional characteristics in the beef cattle studied. The FAM19A5 gene was associated with animals’ hip height, height and body length.

62

This is the first time this protein has been linked to the dimensional features of the animal body.

You-Bin Lee et al in 2019 showed that serum FAM19A5 concentrations (pg/mL) were higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [median (interquartile range), 172.70 (116.19, 286.42)] compared to those without diabetes [92.09 (70.32, 147.24)] (p<0.001). The association of FAM19A5 with other metabolic parameters was also checked, as well as with anthropometric measurements. Increases in the serum FAM19A5 tertile were associated with trends in waist-to-hip ratio, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and mean shoulder pulse wave velocity. The authors’ novel results showed that FAM19A5 serum was positively correlated with waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, alanine aminotransferase, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and mean shoulder pulse wave velocity. This was the first study to link FAM19A5 to selected inflammation parameters in people with type 2 diabetes.

55

Xia Lei, in 2019, showed that the expression of FAM19A5 in various areas of the mouse brain is induced or suppressed by undernutrition and nutritional states. In male mice, FAM19A5 deficiency altered food intake patterns during the light-dark cycle. The authors highlighted for the first time the potential role of the FAM19A5 protein in modulating physiology and links to appetite.

56

Fatemeh Ali Yari et al wanted to test whether FAM19A5 is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Sixty-nine patients were included in the study, including 37 with NAFLD and 32 from the control group. In the results, the plasma FAM19A5 concentration in NAFLD patients was significantly lower in NAFLD patients compared with the control group. Moreover, significant negative correlations were observed between plasma FAM19A5 levels and BMI, visceral fat, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), liver stiffness (LS), and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). This is the first time circulating FAM19A5 levels have been reported to be associated with NAFLD. The authors suggested continuing research to link FAM19A5 with liver disorders.

57

It was also checked whether the concentration of FAM19A5 protein differs in people with MetS compared to healthy people. This was our study, the aim of which was to look for a relationship between FAM19A5 and MetS exponents for the first time. The concentration of FAM19A5 was determined in 45 people with MetS (group A) and 35 healthy people without MetS (group B). There were no differences in the blood levels of FAM19A5 between the groups. The level of FAM19A5 was 163.16±55.11 pg/mL and 197.57±112.89 pg/mL (p=0.1341) in subjects with and without MetS, respectively. In group A, there was a correlation between FAM19A5 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (R= –0.40) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (R= –0.37). In patients with MetS, elevated FAM19A5 serum levels may indicate dyslipidemia development.

58

The FAM19A5 protein has also been shown to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. In 2018, Yingbao Wang et al examined whether adipose tissue-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology following trauma in rats. It was shown that the FAM19A5 protein was abundantly expressed in adipose tissue. Interestingly, FAM19A5 expression was decreased in obese mice. FAM19A5 overexpression significantly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and neointima formation in injured rat carotid arteries. The information from the 2018 project by Yingbao Wang et al was a breakthrough in the reports on the importance of FAMA19A5. The FAM19A5 protein was first identified as an adipokine.

29

Fei Ma et al 2022 checked whether there are clinical associations between FAM19A5 levels and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). The study included 186 patients with CAD and 58 without CAD who underwent coronary angiography (CAG). Serum FAM19A5 levels in the CAD group were significantly lower than in the non-CAD group [1.53 (1.13–2.27) ng/mL vs 2.33 (1.69–3.51) ng/mL; P = 0.013]. Logistic regression analysis showed that reduced serum FAM19A5 concentration was a risk factor for coronary heart disease (OR: 0.563, 95% CI: 0.409–0.776, p < 0.001). According to the authors, serum FAM19A5 concentration has been negatively associated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease and may represent a new biomarker for diagnosing and determining the severity of coronary artery disease.

63

Chen Weia et al 2022 checked whether FAM19A5 is associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study included 168 consecutive hospitalized patients with suspected ACS. After adjusting for confounding factors, serum FAM19A5 levels were independently associated with ACS (p < 0.05). Moreover, serum FAM19A5 levels correlated with ACS severity. FAM19A5 is, therefore, a new potential clinical biomarker of ACS.

Introduction

The human proteome can be envisioned as an array of nodes grouped into local communities, where each node represents one protein and each local community represents a protein complex or network (

Budayeva and Kirkpatrick, 2020

;

Huttlin et al., 2017

). These communities determine physiological function and subcellular localization. Many communities include secreted protein ligands, their cell surface receptors, and signaling molecules that bind to the receptors. The human secretome on its own constitutes approximately 15% of all human genes and encodes more than 4000 different proteins (

Uhlén et al., 2019

) with a wide range of tissue expression (

Figure 1A and B

). Most of the new drugs developed in recent years target secreted proteins and their receptors, and new therapeutic targets are likely to emerge from screens to identify ligand-receptor interactions (

Clark et al., 2003

;

Stastna and Van Eyk, 2012

).

(

Mapping of interactions that occur at the cell surface has significantly lagged behind that of intracellular interactions, because the most widely used high-throughput protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening methods, including affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS), yeast two-hybrid screening (Y2H), and phage display, are not well suited to analysis of extracellular domain (ECD) interactions (

Havugimana et al., 2012

;

Huttlin et al., 2015

;

Krogan et al., 2006

;

Martinez-Martin, 2017

). ECD interactions are often of low affinity, with K

D

s in the micromolar range, and can have fast dissociation rates, rendering them difficult to detect since they may not produce stable complexes (

Honig and Shapiro, 2020

). As a consequence, ECD interactions are generally underrepresented in screens that rely on the formation of such complexes (

Braun et al., 2009

;

Martinez-Martin et al., 2019

;

Özkan et al., 2013

;

Söllner and Wright, 2009

;

Wojtowicz et al., 2020

). In addition, many putative ECD interactions reported by AP/MS and Y2H protein interaction databases have the tendency to be false positives. AP/MS produces false positives for cell surface proteins due to incomplete solubilization of membranes, leading to identification of indirect interactions. Y2H examines interactions inside the cell, but most ECDs have disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites. To acquire these modifications and fold correctly, cell surface and secreted proteins must move through the secretory pathway. Because of this, ECD interactions detected by Y2H are often false positives due to domain misfolding. Similar issues apply to phage display and to microarrays in which mRNAs are translated on a chip. Thus, while these high-throughput methods can identify interactions with the cytoplasmic domains of receptors, they usually fail to find genuine ECD interactions.

Successful high-throughput screens to detect weak ECD interactions in vitro have taken advantage of avidity effects by expressing ECDs as fusions with multimerization domains. In such binary interaction screens, one protein (the bait) is applied to a surface, and the other (the prey) is in solution. Prey binding to the bait is assessed using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. These methods include AVEXIS, ECIA, apECIA, alpha-Screen, and BPIA, which are carried out using ELISA plates, chips, or beads (

Braun et al., 2009

;

Bushell et al., 2008

;

Li et al., 2017

;

Martinez-Martin, 2017

;

Shilts et al., 2022

;

Taouji et al., 2009

). However, in vitro screens have limitations. They require robotic high-throughput instrumentation and are time-consuming and expensive to carry out on a large scale, since they require synthesis of ECD coding regions and expression of individual bait and prey proteins. In addition, in vitro screens cannot usually assess binding to ECDs of receptors that span the membrane multiple times, because such ECDs are often composed of noncontiguous loops and cannot be easily expressed in a soluble form. Furthermore, in vitro binary interaction mapping technologies lack the natural spatial context of the cell membrane. They may also fail in cases where cofactors and/or post-translational modifications are required for binding.

To address these issues, several groups have successfully developed cell-based screens for phenotypical screens (

Bassik et al., 2013

;

Han et al., 2020

;

Kamber et al., 2021

), uncovering signaling cascades (

Breslow et al., 2018

;

Wisnovsky et al., 2021

) or to study interactions between cell surface receptors using receptor ECDs (

Chong et al., 2018

), that take advantage of CRISPR technology (

Cong et al., 2013

;

Jinek et al., 2013

;

Mali et al., 2013

). In CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens such as the one described here, gene expression is induced by targeting transcriptional activators (

Chavez et al., 2016

;

Chong et al., 2018

;

Tycko et al., 2017

) to their control elements using sgRNAs (

Kampmann, 2018

;

Morgens et al., 2016

;

Tanenbaum et al., 2014

). Utilizing CRISPRa pooled sgRNA libraries eliminates the need to create expensive collection of synthetic genes, and in addition allows a forward positive screening workflow which enables a higher dynamic range compared to loss-of-function screens (

Doench, 2018

). Libraries of cells, each with an sgRNA targeting one receptor, can be easily stored and screened for binding to soluble ligands.

Here, we describe a CRISPRa enrichment workflow that employs customized, pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with magnetic bead-based selection (magnetic-activated cell sorting [MACS]) to enrich for receptor-expressing cells. This approach allows cost-efficient parallel screening with multiple ligands. We created two cell libraries, comprising all single-pass transmembrane (TM1) and multi-pass transmembrane (TM2+) receptors, and screened them with a collection of secreted ligands. To define a set of high-priority ligands, we first curated the human-secreted proteome and selected and expressed 20 at levels sufficient for screening the TM1 and TM2+ libraries. We identified new receptor candidates in more than half of these screens. These were validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and/or cell binding assays. These studies define new receptors for several secreted ligands that function in the immune and nervous systems and provides a resource for future investigations of relationships between the human-secreted and membrane proteome.

Results

A CRISPR activating enrichment screening platform

A large variety of different second-generation dCas9 activator (CRISPRa) systems are currently in use. A recent study directly compared a large number of published Cas9 activators systems and found the VPR, SunTag, and SAM approaches perform equally effective across a number of different cell lines and target genes (

Chavez et al., 2016

;

Kampmann, 2018

). The SunTag system was initially developed in K562 cells (myeloid leukemia cell line K562) (

Tanenbaum et al., 2014

), a highly characterized (ENCODE, The Protein Atlas) and easy to handle suspension cell line that is widely used for CRISPR screens and highly suitable for MACS-based applications. CRISPR-mediated activation of transcription using the SunTag system (termed sunCas9) is a precise and scalable method for inducing expression of endogenous genes across a high dynamic range (

Gilbert et al., 2014

). This system uses a dead Cas9 (dCas9) variant fused to a SunTag, a multicopy epitope tag that recruits the VP64 transcriptional activator via binding to a cytoplasmic scFV-nanobody-VP64 fusion protein. sgRNAs guide this complex to the enhancer region of the gene of interest and facilitate target-specific gene activation and expression (

Tanenbaum et al., 2014

).

To evaluate the performance and feasibility of CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation of cell surface proteins for a receptor/ligand interaction discovery platform, we first selected 10 well-characterized cell surface receptors with varying mRNA expression levels ranging from not detected to highly expressed in K562 human myeloid leukemia cells (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1A

;

Thul et al., 2017

;

Uhlén et al., 2019

). We then generated a pooled lentiviral mini-library of 10 sgRNAs per enhancer (100 sgRNA elements), matched with 100 control sgRNAs derived from scrambled sequences (

Gilbert et al., 2014

) and transduced K562 cells stably expressing the sunCas9 system (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1A

). Each library plasmid contained a single sgRNA targeting one of the 10 genes, a GFP fluorescent marker and a puromycin resistance marker. The library-transduced cells were puromycin selected for 5 days to obtain >90% GFP positive cells. The expression levels of the 10 cell surface receptors were then evaluated by cell surface staining (CSS) using APC- (allophycocyanin) labeled antibodies against the respective targets (CD122 was used as a control). In summary, the majority (8 out of 10) targets showed elevated cell surface expression to varying degrees in comparison to non-transduced K562 sunCas9 cells or a control receptor (CD122) that was not part of the mini-library (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B

).

We then used human interleukin 2 (IL-2), which has a high affinity receptor subunit termed CD25 (IL2RA), to validate our screening workflow in two parallel screens, simulating two library sizes by diluting the 10 target (100 sgRNA) K562 sunCas9 mini-library by 1:20 and 1:200 with non-transduced K562 sunCas9 cells, corresponding to final library sizes of 200 and 2000 targets, respectively (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-F

). Both library pools were incubated with magnetic streptavidin microbeads complexed with biotinylated IL-2, and IL-2 binding cells were isolated in a positive selection workflow by MACS, using Miltenyi LS-MACS columns (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D

). After labeling, washing, and elution, positively selected cells were expanded and stained using an APC-labeled anti-CD25 antibody (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1D

). Genomic DNA was extracted from both consecutive rounds of selection as well as the naïve K562 sunCas9 mini-library itself, followed by barcoding and deep sequencing for both libraries.

Deep sequencing data for each round of selection was analyzed and hits were identified using the robust casTLE statistical framework (

Morgens et al., 2016

) and results were analyzed, filtered, and visualized. We calculated casTLE metrics for each round of selection in comparison to the naïve library. Using casTLE, both IL-2 CRISPRa screens successfully identified IL-2 receptor alpha (IL2RA; CD25) as the top hit with the highest confidence (casTLE Score), casTLE Effects, and significance (pValue) (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1E

). Side by side comparison of enrichment scores for both rounds of selections from both libraries was plotted as bar graphs (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1F

).

Customized, pooled CRISPRa cell surface receptor library design

Having established the screening workflow (

Figure 1E

,

Figure 1—figure supplement 1

), we sought to leverage the power and efficiency of customized, pooled CRISPRa cell surface libraries to perform targeted screens with secreted orphan ligands. We first compiled a comprehensive list of cell surface receptors by carefully curating the human membrane proteome (

Figure 1A

). We chose a targeted cell surface library approach instead of a genome-wide approach, allowing a smaller library size, resulting in a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and avoiding unwanted transcriptional upregulation of non-membrane proteins. We utilized several databases including HUGO, UniProt, the Human Protein Atlas, and bioinformatic tools (SignalP, TMHMM) to compile two cell surface target lists covering both TM1 and TM2+ cell surface proteins (

Figure 1C

). For the CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation of cell surface proteins, we synthesized and cloned two pooled sgRNA libraries, a TM1 and a TM2+ library, each with 10 sgRNAs per target (

Gilbert et al., 2014

). Both libraries include matched controls targeting genomic locations without annotated function (

Figure 1C, D

). K562 cells stably expressing the sunCas9 system were infected with both libraries (TM1; TM2+) at low, medium, and high multiplicity of infection (MOI), then selected with puromycin until the cell population was at least 90% GFP positive, indicating the presence of lentivirus. Cells were recovered and expanded, and representative aliquots were saved as naïve library stocks in liquid nitrogen with at least ×1000 cell number coverage per sgRNA to maintain maximum library complexity. Sufficient sgRNA representation of the naïve library was confirmed by deep sequencing after puromycin selection and showed the highest coverage and diversity at low MOI with at least 91% of reads with at least one reported alignment (R=0.97) for both libraries (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H

). Library information including sgRNA target IDs and sequences for both libraries (TM1; TM2+) can be found in

Figure 1—source data 1

.

CRISPRa benchmark screen using human IL-2

After library cloning and validation, we benchmarked the sensitivity and robustness of our screening platform with a proof of concept screen using human IL-2, following the protocols used for the mini-library (

Figure 1—figure supplement 1

). We successfully recovered CD25 (IL2RA) as the top hit after two rounds of enrichment, deep sequencing, and analysis following the outlined workflow (

Figure 1E

). Initially, the naïve TM1 library showed no positive IL-2 binding by tetramer staining (

Figure 1F

). Library enrichment was monitored by IL-2 tetramer staining (IL-2:SA647; 200 nM) throughout the selection workflow, and after only one round of positive selection we observed a significant enrichment of IL-2 selected cells, from 0.1% to 13.3% IL-2 tetramer positive cells (

Figure 1F

; middle FACS plot). After expanding the cells from the first round and subjecting them to a second round of CRISPRa enrichment screening, we observed a further robust increase of IL-2 tetramer positive from 13.3 to 95% IL-2 tetramer positive cells (

Figure 1F

; right FACS plot).

After each consecutive round of selection, enriched cells were expanded and genomic DNA was extracted, followed by barcoding and deep sequencing. Genomic DNA from the K562 sunCas9 TM1 naïve library itself served as the baseline. Following deep sequencing, data from both rounds of consecutive IL-2 selections was analyzed and visualized using the casTLE statistical framework. To predict high-confidence interaction pairs from each dataset, a custom score was then computed for each potential interaction pair by combining all three metrics (casTLE Score, casTLE Effect, and pValue) into one ESP score: (casTLE-Effect + casTLE Score)/pValue. CD25 was identified as the top hit with the highest confidence (casTLE Score), pValue (significance), and casTLE Effect (

Figure 1G, H

). Furthermore, we used the casTLE ESP metrics from each round to plot trajectories of CD25, which allows for a direct evaluation of sgRNA enrichment throughout the selection workflow and shows a positive trajectory for CD25 in the selection workflow (

Figure 1I

), validating the sensitivity and robustness of our screening pipeline.

Selection and production of secreted proteins for CRISPRa screening

We first generated a secreted proteome master list from several databases, including HUGO, UniProt, the Human Protein Atlas (

Uhlén et al., 2019

), and bioinformatic tools (SignalP, TMHMM) to identify potential high-priority secreted proteins for our screening workflow. After curation of the human-secreted proteome (

Figure 1A, B

), approximately 60% of the ~1600 genes were classified as encoding enzymes (mostly proteases), enzyme inhibitors, serum proteins, or components of saliva, tears, or other fluids (these include carrier proteins), structural, extracellular matrix proteins, antimicrobial proteins, complement factors, coagulation factors, lectins, or unknown. The remaining ~40% of genes were identified as likely to encode secreted ligands acting through cell surface receptors and further examined through literature searches. We classified products of 419 genes as ligands with known receptors that can adequately account for their biology. Finally, we identified 206 gene products either as ‘orphans’ with no identified receptor or as ligands that are likely to have additional, as yet unidentified receptors in addition to those that have been described. From these 206, we ultimately selected a total of 80 high-priority targets (one per gene; we did not consider isoforms generated through alternative splicing). These had a wide range of tissue expression with many of the chosen secreted ligands being expressed in brain tissue (

Figure 2A

) covering a broad range of molecular function and processes (

Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B

). Coding sequences for these 80 secreted proteins of interest (SPOI) were synthesized, subcloned into an Avi-6xHIS expression plasmid (

Figure 2—source data 1

), expressed in Expi293F cells, purified with Ni-NTA resin, then biotinylated in vitro and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (

CRISRPa enrichment screens reveal new secreted ligand-receptor interactions

We obtained sufficiently high expression levels for 20 of the 80 high-priority targets (

Figure 2A

,

Figure 2—source data 2

) to allow screening using our cell-based CRISPRa enrichment workflow. In addition to the Expi293F expression system, we explored whether insect expression could serve as viable alternative expression strategy to rescue some of the secreted ligands that failed to express in the Expi293F expression system. To test this strategy, we selected a total of 12 candidates that were subcloned for expression in insect cells (Hi5): 10 candidates that showed no expression from Expi293F cells and an additional 2 candidates that were previously successfully expressed in Expi293F (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN). While the control candidates (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN) showed some low level of expression from insect cells, none of the other 10 candidates tested showed any positive expression (

Figure 2—source data 2

). Names and mRNA expression patterns in normal tissue for these 20 ligands are shown in

Figure 2A

. The 20 high-priority targets show a wide spectrum of tissue expression in normal, healthy tissue (

Figure 2A

) and a broad range of expression in cancer (

Figure 2B

) with several candidates enriched in brain tissue and clustering in glioma (GBM, brain tissue, and in various locations in the nervous system, including the brain stem and spinal column). In addition, the majority of targets show a strong GDA with many reported diseases (

Figure 2C

,

Figure 2—figure supplement 4

,

Figure 2—source data 3

).

Each of the 20 secreted ligands was used to screen the TM1 and TM2+ libraries with up to three consecutive rounds of selection, followed by deep sequencing and statistical analysis using the casTLE framework (

Figure 2—source data 4

). In general, screening results of the final round of enrichment were subjected to a first-pass filter using the following cut-offs: casTLE-Effect > 2, casTLE-Score > 2, pValue < 0.05, candidates outside the secreted and membrane proteome and common false positive contaminants were removed. To integrate data analysis and visualization, we used the combined ESP score to rank sort interaction pairs for every screen. In addition, we utilized the aforementioned trajectory plots, which allow for direct evaluation of a potential candidate’s enrichment throughout the selection workflow and easy elimination of false positives.

PPIs often occur between phylogenetically related proteins both within and between subfamilies. Hence, screening results were augmented by using phylogenetic homology analysis (PHA), a strategy that has proven to be highly effective to predict additional PPIs between subfamily members (

Wojtowicz et al., 2020

). Furthermore, in an effort to explore potential functional relationships between orphan-secreted ligands and newly discovered interactions, mRNA expression profiles from healthy tissues were obtained from The Human Protein Atlas (

Karlsson et al., 2021

) to perform hierarchical clustering and correlation analysis.

We selected a subset of CRISPRa enrichment screens with high ranking predicted ESP scores for potential interaction pairs for further validation using orthogonal methods, including SPR and CSS. Bona fide PPIs are expected to display distinct association and dissociation kinetics, which can be observed with high sensitivity by SPR, the ‘gold’ standard to measure biomolecular interactions. CSS was utilized as an alternative orthogonal validation method to show PPIs in a cellular context using a fluorescent-tetramerization-based approach by flow cytometry for high sensitivity detection of putative PPIs on the cell surface. In a first-pass analysis we selected the validated hits of the CRISPRa enrichment screens and performed database searches to calculate overlaps between our screening results and the aggregate of BioGrid, BioPlex, and STRING databases (physical interactions; membrane and secreted proteome). We observed no overlap between any of these databases and the hits reported in this study (

Figure 2D

). As we previously reported for interactome screens of

Drosophila

and human cell surface proteins (

Özkan et al., 2013

;

Wojtowicz et al., 2020

), high-throughput PPI analysis methods such as Y2H and AP/MS generate mostly false positive interactions for secreted and membrane proteins and are unable to identify genuine interactions found through ELISA and/or cell-based screening methods.

In total, we tested 22 candidate PPIs between the secreted and membrane proteome by SPR and/or CSS from 12 screens with PPIs in both the TM1 and the TM2+ library. A cytoscape interaction network of novel PPIs observed in screen is visualized in

Figure 2E

Oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein binds to multiple receptor tyrosine phosphatases

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory step in intracellular signal transduction and is orchestrated in a coordinated fashion by activities of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTPs play essential roles in the regulation of growth, differentiation, oncogenic transformation, and other processes (

Julien et al., 2010

). The classical PTPs include cytoplasmic PTPs and transmembrane RPTPs, which can be classified into distinct subfamilies according to their domain architecture. Most RPTPs display features of cell adhesion molecules with a diverse domain repertoire including MAM (meprin, A-5) domains, Ig (immunoglobulin-like) domains, and FN (fibronectin) Type III repeats in their extracellular segments (

Figure 3M

;

Tonks, 2006

). In our human in vitro interactome screen, we identified new cell surface binding partners for multiple RPTPs that are likely to mediate cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions (

Wojtowicz et al., 2020

).

In our CRISPRa screen with oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMG), we observed the Type R2B subfamily member PTPRU as the top-ranking hit (

Figure 3A

) with a positive enrichment trajectory over all three rounds of selection (

Figure 3B

). We confirmed binding of OMG to PTPRU by SPR, with a K

D

of ~70 nM (

Figure 3C

). We also identified two members of the R2A subfamily, PTPRF and PTPRS, as well as the R4 subfamily member PTPRA as enriched in the OMG screen (

Figure 3D

). Type R2A (PTPRD, PTPRF, PTPRS), R2B (PTPRK, PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRU), and R3 (PTPRB, PTPRH, PTPRJ, PTPRO, PTPRP) are the largest RPTP subfamilies. They all share large ECDs that include FN-III repeats. R2A RPTPs also have Ig domains, and R2B RPTPs have both Ig and MAM domains (

Figure 3M

). PPIs often occur between phylogenetically related proteins both within and between subfamilies. We examined binding of OMG to all R2A and R2B subfamily members as well as PRPRJ (R3) by SPR. Binding in the micromolar affinity range was observed for all three R2A RPTPs (PTPRD, PTPRF, PTPRS) but only for PTPRU among R2B RPTPs (

Figure 3E

;

Figure 3—figure supplement 1A

). Hierarchical clustering by healthy tissue expression correlations may infer functionally related communities. We therefore examined healthy tissue mRNA expression profiles for OMG, R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP family members from the Human Protein Atlas (

Karlsson et al., 2021

) and performed a multivariate clustering analysis. OMG clustered with several RPTP family members including binding partners PTPRU and PTPRD (

Figure 3F

). In the nervous system, these RPTPs are expressed primarily in neurons, and could function as receptors for OMG, which is expressed in oligodendrocytes and some neurons (

Figure 3—figure supplement 1B

).

PTPRU binds to Osteocrin (OSTN), a primate-specific brain ligand

PTPRU was also identified as a potential hit in a screen for Osteocrin (OSTN). Although our initial ESP ranking showed PTPRJ, a RPTP member of the R3 subfamily, as the top-ranking hit for OSTN (

Figure 3G

), analyzing the enrichment trajectories over all three rounds of selections revealed that PTPRJ actually followed a negative trajectory (

Figure 3H

). By contrast, the R2B family member PTPRU showed a significant positive enrichment trajectory over the course of the screening workflow compared to PTPRJ (

Figure 3H

). We therefore analyzed binding of OSTN to a panel of R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP members and found that OSTN exclusively bound to PTPRU, with a K

D

of ~12 nM (

Figure 3I, J

) and none of the other R2A or R2B subfamily members (

Figure 3—figure supplement 1C

).

OSTN (Musclin) is a 130 aa peptide hormone that was originally identified in mouse bone and muscle. It regulates bone growth, supports physical endurance, and mediates diverse cardiac benefits of physical activity (

Subbotina et al., 2015

). These actions could be mediated through OSTN’s binding to the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) (

Moffatt et al., 2007

). By binding to NPR-C, OSTN decreases clearance of natriuretic peptides and thereby increases signaling through the NPR-A and NPR-B receptors. In primates, however, the OSTN gene has acquired neuron-specific regulatory elements, and primate OSTN is expressed in cortical neurons and is induced by depolarization in in vitro cultures and by sensory stimuli in vivo. OSTN restricts dendritic growth after depolarization. OSTN expression peaks during the onset of synaptogenesis in fetal development, but it continues to be expressed in neocortex in adults (

Ataman et al., 2016

). A pairwise correlation of normal human tissue mRNA expression data for OSTN and the R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP subfamilies showed correlation only with PTPRU and its close relative PTPRT (

Figure 3K

). A hierarchical cluster analysis of human tissue mRNA expression data shows a strong correlation of OSTN and PTPRU in brain and skeletal muscle (

Figure 3L

; Cluster 3).

A PHA of the R2A, R2B, and R4 PTPR subfamily was combined with a summary of PPIs identified for OMG and OSTN as a node/edge network (

Figure 3N

). While the R2A subfamily members cluster closely within their family, the R2B subfamily appears to be more diverse with two subclusters (PTPRM and PTPRT, PTPRK, and PTPRU) and might be due to the fact that MAM domains are less conserved than FN or Ig domains (

Figure 3—figure supplement 1D

).

The growth arrest specific 1 protein (GAS1) binds to PTPRA

PTPRA was identified as the highest-ranking hit in the growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) screen, with the highest ESP score and a consistent positive enrichment over three rounds of positive selection (

Figure 4A, B

), followed by lower scoring PTPRU and PTPRJ with low enrichment trajectory (

Figure 4C

). PTPRA is a member of the R4 RPTP subfamily (see also

Figure 3M

), which have short, highly glycosylated ECDs (

Tonks, 2006

). GAS1 bound exclusively to PTPRA, with a K

D

of ~1 µM (

Figure 4D

). No binding was observed to PTPRU or PTPRJ (

Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B

) by SPR. We also showed that tetramerized GAS1 (GAS1:SA647) exhibits increased binding to K562 cells that overexpress PTPRA, demonstrating that GAS1 is a soluble ligand for cell surface PTPRA (

Figure 4E

,

Figure 4—figure supplement 1C

). A multivariate clustering showed that GAS1 is clustering more closely to PTPRA than to PTPRU or PTPRJ (

Figure 4F

).

PTPRA is ubiquitously expressed, while GAS1 has a more restricted expression pattern with a stronger correlation with PTPRA in fibroblasts, Muller glia cells, and skeletal myocytes (

Figure 4G

, Clusters 6–8). GAS1 and PTPRA are both involved in RET tyrosine kinase signaling through SRC, as well as in other signaling pathways (

Biau et al., 2013

;

Mustelin and Hunter, 2002

;

Yao et al., 2017

). GAS1 is related to the GFR1 family of transmembrane proteins, which are coreceptors for the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET-GFR1 complexes bind to glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), leading to RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. GAS1 interacts directly with RET and recruits it to lipid rafts. GAS1 binding causes a reduction in GDNF-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that it is a negative regulator of RET signaling (

Cabrera et al., 2006

;

López-Ramírez et al., 2008

). PTPRA also associates with RET signaling complexes and can directly dephosphorylate RET, causing inhibition of RET signaling (

Yadav et al., 2020

). Elevated levels of PTPRA leads to promotion of lung cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival (

Gu et al., 2017

;

Lin et al., 2020

) through c-Src activation. PTPRA has not been demonstrated to directly bind to RET, however, and a linkage between PTPRA and RET might be provided by GAS1.

TAFA-2 selectively interacts with inhibitory KIRs

A CRISPRa enrichment screen with TAFA-2 (FAM19A2; chemokine-like family member 2) identified two inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL3, which are selectively expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, as the highest-ranking hits by ESP scoring (

Figure 5A

) with a positive trajectory during the selection workflow (

Figure 5B

). KIRs are a polymorphic subfamily of MHC class I receptors (

Li and Mariuzza, 2014

;

Pende et al., 2019

;

Sivori et al., 2019

). KIR3s have D0, D1, and D2 Ig-like domains. By contrast, KIR2s have only D1 and D2 domains, except for KIR2DL5, which has a D0 and D2 but lacks D1 (

Figure 5C

). The structure of KIR3DL1 complexed to an HLA-B reveals that the helices and bound peptide of the HLA engage with the D1 and D2 domains of the KIR, while the D0 domain extends down toward the β-2-microglobulin subunit and engages sequences that are highly conserved among all HLA-A and B alleles (

Li and Mariuzza, 2014

).

We observed binding of TAFA-2 to KIR3DL1 to by SPR, with a K

D

of ~1.7 µM (

Figure 5D

,

Figure 5—figure supplement 1A

). Binding to KIR3DL3 was at the limit of detection and did not saturate (

Figure 5—figure supplement 1B

). To examine binding at the cell surface, fluorescent TAFA-2 tetramers (TAFA2:SA647) were incubated with NKL or NKL cells expressing either full-length KIR3DL1 or KIR2DL1 (

Figure 5E

; left panels). Flow cytometry analysis revealed concentration-dependent binding of TAFA-2 to cells expressing KIR3DL1, but not to those expressing KIR2DL1 (

Figure 5E

; right panel).

Interestingly, a PHA of inhibitory KIR family members revealed that D0 domain containing KIRs are more closely related by sequence than KIRs without a D0 domain (

Figure 5F

). Hence, to further define KIR binding specificity, we tested binding of TAFA-2 tetramers (TAFA2:SA647) to K562 cells expressing KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, KIR2DL2, or KIR2DL5A. We observed higher concentration-dependent binding of TAFA-2 to cells expressing the KIR3s or KIR2DL5A, which all have D0 domains, compared to KIR2DL2, which does not have a D0 domain (

Figure 5G

,

Figure 5—figure supplement 1C

). These data suggest that D0 domains are required for optimal TAFA-2 binding.

TAFA-2 is a member of a highly conserved 5-gene family (TAFA1-5) of chemokine-like peptides (neurokines) expressed in the brain. Like other chemokines, TAFAs 1, 4, and 5 bind to G protein-coupled receptors. TAFAs 1–4 all complex with neurexins during their passage through the ER/Golgi pathway, leading to formation of disulfide-bonded cell surface neurexin-TAFA complexes (

Khalaj et al., 2020

;

Sarver et al., 2021

;

Tom Tang et al., 2004

). Although TAFA-2 has only been examined in the brain, the gene is also expressed in the immune system. Its expression is restricted to naïve and memory regulatory T cells (T-regs), basophils, and neutrophils, with the highest expression levels being observed in basophils (

Figure 5H

). Neurexins are not expressed in these cell types, so TAFA-2 may be secreted as a monomer or complexed to another protein. The observed interactions of TAFA-2 with D0 domains of KIRs suggest that expression of the chemokine by T-regs or basophils might modulate KIR signaling in NK cells in response to binding of HLA on target cells. In addition to HLA, KIR3DL3 was more recently discovered as a novel interaction partner for HHLA2 (a immune checkpoint member of the B7 family), which has both immune inhibitory and activating abilities and is expressed in many human cancers (

Wei et al., 2021

). Interestingly, KIR3DL3 and TMIGD2, another HHLA2 interaction partner, were simultaneously able to bind to different sites of HHLA2. This would open another intriguing way of regulating signaling KIR3DL3/TMIGD2-HHLA2 with regard to the newly discovered KIR3DL3-TAFA2 interaction.

Screening results for pleiotrophin family members (MDK, PTN), neurokine superfamily members (TAFA-2, TAFA-5), and a SPARC-related ligand (SMOC1)

In

Figure 6

, we show results of additional screens with shared hits for the pleiotrophin family members midkine (MDK) and pleiotrophin (PTN), and the neurokine family members TAFA-2 and TAFA-5.

We analyzed the top 20 highest ranking candidates for MDK, PTN, TAFA-2, and TAFA5 and found a strong overlap of hits for several candidates (

Figure 6A

). We identified the transmembrane PA-TM-RING E3 ligase RNF167 as shared hits between screens for PTN, TAFA-2, and TAFA-5. PTN and MDK are two members of the neurite growth-promoting factor family. They are neuromodulators with multiple neuronal functions during development (

González-Castillo et al., 2015

). MDK and PTN have been found to bind to several different cell surface receptors, including RPTPZ, which has a CS-linked ECD, Syndecans (which are linked to HS), a transmembrane low-density lipoproteins (LRP), the RTK ALK, and integrins (

Papadimitriou et al., 2016

).

Like TAFA-2, TAFA-5 is a member of the TAFA superfamily, a emerging family of neurokines that are highly expressed in brain tissue, especially hippocampus, cerebral cortex, white matter, and ganglia (

Figure 6F

).

TAFA5

knockout mice display increased depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory (

Huang et al., 2021

).

We observed binding of RNF167 to PTN and MDK as well as TAFA-2 and TAFA-5 by SPR (

Figure 6B, C

, blue sensogram). No binding was observed to RNF128 which is a related transmembrane E3 ligase of the same subfamily (

Figure 6B, C

, red sensogram) and no binding was observed to RNF167 testing an unrelated receptor ECD (

Figure 6—figure supplement 1A

). RNF167 is a member of the transmembrane PA-TM-RING E3 ligase family with approximately 10 members and exert widespread involvement in several diseases (

Cai et al., 2022

). These E3 ligases are minimally defined by three conserved domains, a protease-associated (PA) domain that acts as a substrate recruitment domain, a transmembrane domain (TM), and a RING-H2 finger (RNF) (

Nakamura, 2011

). In general, the E3 ligase family (~600 predicted RING E3’s) still remains highly elusive and the majority of PA-TM-RING E3 ligases remain orphans, mostly due to the nature of the ubiquitylation cascade, which are being characterized by very weak affinity and fast kinetics (

Duan and Pagano, 2021

;

Komander and Rape, 2012

;

Metzger et al., 2014

). RNF167 (also known as Godzilla) is widely expressed in all tissues with enhanced expression in brain tissue (

Figure 6F

) and has recently been implicated in the regulation of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) (

Ghilarducci et al., 2021

;

Lussier et al., 2012

). A two-way hierarchical clustering of normal tissue mRNA expression data shows a strong correlation between RNF167, TAFA-2, TAFA-2, and PTN in brain tissue (

; Cluster 2).

The transmembrane RTK ROR1 and the membrane Frizzled (FZD)-related protein (MFRP) were identified as shared candidate hits among several screens: PTN, MDK, TAFA-2, and TAFA-5. We observed binding of PTN to ROR1 and MFRP (

Figure 6D, E

) with K

D

s between ~1 and 2 µM, no binding was observed for MDK (

Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C

). Interestingly, both receptors share an evolutionary conserved FZD domain in the ECD (

Yan et al., 2014

). ROR1 and its closely related paralog ROR2 are receptors for Wnt5a and other Wnts in the planar cell polarity pathway (

Endo et al., 2022

;

Green et al., 2014

;

Minami et al., 2010

). MFRP is Type II transmembrane protein with an extracellular FZD domain. MFRP is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium with high expression in brain tissue (choroid plexus and required for both prenatal ocular growth and postnatal emmetropization

Katoh, 2001

;

Sundin et al., 2008

). A PHA of the involved PPIs shows a clear family-based clustering and separation into neurokine, pleiotrophin, FZD domain containing branches (

Figure 6G

). A node/edge network of PPI discovered similarly show two distinct clusters of interactions (

Figure 6H

; Clusters 1 and 2) that overlap with tissue expression clustering (

Figure 6F

).

SMOC1, a SPARC-related ligand overexpressed in brain tumors (

Brellier et al., 2011

), recovered BST2, IGSF23, and SMOC2 as the highest-ranking hits (

Figure 6I and J

). We observed binding of SMOC1 to SMOC2 by SPR (

Figure 6K

, blue sensogram). No binding was observed to IGSF23 or BST2 (

Figure 6K

; red sensograms). We also observed binding of SMOC1 to itself (

Figure 6L

; blue sensogram). SMOC2 is a matricellular protein which promotes matrix assembly and is involved in endothelial cell proliferation and migration, more recently SMOC2 variants were also reported to play a role in BMP signaling (

Long et al., 2021

).

The scavenger receptor CD36 acts as a receptor for a broad range of secreted ligands

CD36, also known as SCARB3 or glycoprotein 4 (GPIV), is a multifunctional Type B scavenger receptor with two transmembrane domains and an ~410 aa ECD. CD36 is known to bind to many ligands (

Silverstein and Febbraio, 2009

). In our analysis of TM2+ library screens we identified CD36 as a top scoring hit in several screens: KRTDAP, LY6H, NRN1, NRN1L, VWC2L, and SCRG1 (

Figure 7A

). To examine potential binding of these secreted ligands to CD36 on the cell surface, fluorescent tetramers of LY6H, NRN1, VW2CL, and SCRG1 were incubated with 293F cells or 293F cells expressing full-length CD36 (

Figure 7B

,

Figure 7—figure supplement 1A

). We observed binding of LY6H, NRN1, VW2CL, and SCRG1 to CD36 by FACS. SPRC, which showed no enrichment of CD36 in its screen, served as a control and did in fact not bind to CD36 (

Figure 7B, C

). All CD36 enriched secreted ligands (LY6H, NRN1, NRN1L, VWC2L, SCRG1) except for KRTDAP show a strong correlation and cluster in brain tissue, which expresses CD36 mRNA only at low levels (

Figure 7D

). A PHA of all screens enriched for CD36 shows that VWC2L, LY6H, NRN1, NRN1L, and to some extent SCRG1 are more closely related to each other by sequence than KRTDAP (

Figure 7E

). Similarly, a multivariate analysis depicts a strong correlation of all secreted ligand with the exception of KRTDAP and CD36 itself (

Figure 7F

) in normal tissue. However, CD36 protein is expressed in brain microglia, and interestingly CD36-mediated debris uptake regulates brain inflammation in neurodegenerative disease models (

Dobri et al., 2021

;

Grajchen et al., 2020

).

While we also initially identified top scoring candidates for several other screens: MYOC, TICN1, OMG, and MDK, further analysis of their subcellular localization revealed that TMEM14A and REEP4 (indicated by dotted lines in the respective plots) are mainly localized in the ER or mitochondrial membrane compartment and not in the plasma membrane.

Discussion

In an effort to accelerate the discovery of novel interactions between secreted ligands and the membrane proteome, we have developed a proteo-genomic high-throughput cell-based CRISPRa enrichment screening platform by employing customized, pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries encoding transmembrane proteins in combination with MACS to enrich for receptor-expressing cells. We defined a list of 80 high-priority secreted ligands that are likely to have receptors that have not been previously identified. Twenty of these were successfully expressed, biotinylated, coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads, and used in our CRISPRa enrichment screening workflow. After three consecutive rounds of selections and deep sequencing of enriched cells, casTLE statistical analysis enabled high-confidence prediction and identification of interaction pairs from each dataset (

Figures 1

and

2

).

To validate the results of the screens, we used SPR and cell binding methods (CSS) to prove that the receptor candidates actually bound to the ligands used for screening. We then expanded the set of receptor candidates by taking advantage of homology (PHA), examining other members of the gene families identified in the initial screens for binding. Using these approaches, we identified 14 candidate receptors for 12 screened secreted ligands.

Interestingly, in some cases (OMG, TAFA-2), a single ligand bound to multiple receptors in the same family (

Figures 3

and

5

), while in other cases (CD36, RNF167), a single receptor bound to several unrelated ligands (

Figures 6

and

7

). Our results highlight the inability of standard high-throughput in vitro screening methods to identify genuine ECD interactions, because none of the hits from our screens were found in the aggregate of commonly used protein interaction databases (

Figure 2D

) and attests for the sensitivity and robustness of our screening strategy for secreted ligands. This was previously observed when the results of ELISA-based in vitro screens using multimeric ECD fusion proteins were compared with PPIs represented in these databases (

Martinez-Martin, 2017

;

Özkan et al., 2013

;

Ranaivoson et al., 2019

;

Söllner and Wright, 2009

;

Taouji et al., 2009

;

Verschueren et al., 2020

;

Wojtowicz et al., 2020

).

PPIs often occur between phylogenetically related proteins both within and between subfamilies and PPI modules with tight functional relationships similarly are more likely to be co-expressed. While tissue expression correlations can be used as a predictive tool for physical interactions, poor correlations do not necessarily suggest a lack of biological significance especially in the case of secreted ligands which are not restricted to the tissue origin of expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that many of the protein pairs newly identified from the CRISPRa enrichment screens displayed tissue-dependent associations. In some cases, correlations were observed between secreted ligand and the receptor (GAS1, OSTN, OMG, TAFA-2), while in other cases correlations very strongly correlated between hit candidates (CD36).

Our results suggest that the cell-based screening strategy is primarily limited by two factors. First, fewer than one-third of the high-priority ligand candidates were expressed at high enough levels to allow purification for screening. If it were possible to express all of the 206 ligands we identified as targets, one might expect to be able to identify receptors for more than 100 of them. However, it is unclear how this might be accomplished. Second, while a positive selection strategy using CRISPRa has a higher dynamic range compared to loss-of-function screens, successful enrichment and recovery of a potential cell surface receptor PPI is dependent on the efficiency and level of CRISPRa-mediated expression of cell surface receptors. Also, many functional receptors are protein complexes and interactions might involve coreceptors or require chaperones that might not be present in K562 cells. In these cases, sgRNA-driven expression of single genes by CRISPRa would not be able to generate cells that make functional receptor complexes, unless the parental K562 cell line also made the other receptor complex components.

New biology revealed by CRISPRa enrichment screens

The most striking finding from our screen was the identification of three new ligands for RPTPs, a diverse set of cell signaling receptors whose functions are less well understood than those of RTKs. OMG, a ligand expressed by oligodendrocytes and some neurons, binds to all three R3 RPTPs and to one of the R2B RPTPs, PTPRU (

Figure 3

). All of these RPTPs are expressed in the brain. Most interestingly, OSTN, a hormone that regulates bone and muscle growth in rodents but has acquired brain-specific expression and function in primates (

Ataman et al., 2016

), binds only to PTPRU (

Figure 3

). OSTN was reported to be a ligand for NPR-C, which regulates the levels of natriuretic peptides, but this is unlikely to explain its function in the primate brain. PTPRU, however, is expressed in the brain and is closely related to the three other R2B RPTPs, which are homophilic adhesion molecules that regulate cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Moreover, PTPRU cannot mediate cell adhesion on its own, and is thought to lack phosphatase activity (

Hay et al., 2020

), so it may have a distinct function from the other R2B RPTPs.

GAS1, a regulator of Ret signaling involved in control of cell growth and a mediator of cell death (

Cabrera et al., 2006

), binds to PTPRA, an R4 RPTP that has no known ligand (

Figure 4

). PTPRA is a ubiquitously expressed signaling protein that both positively and negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling via dephosphorylation of Src family tyrosine kinases (

Mustelin and Hunter, 2002

). GAS1 may provide a link of PTPRA to RET RTK signaling complexes.

Furthermore, we discovered an unexpected association between TAFA-2, which is known as a neurokine (brain chemokine), and KIRs, which are inhibitory MHC class I receptors that are expressed only by NK cells (

Figure 5

). The TAFA2 gene is also expressed by T-regs and basophils, and TAFA-2 might be a soluble ligand that modulates NK signaling in response to MHC class I engagement. Furthermore, the newly discovered KIR3DL3-TAFA2 interaction may represent another intriguing way of modulating the KIR3DL3/TMIG2-HHLA2 signaling axis within the tumor microenvironment (

Li et al., 2022

;

Wei et al., 2021

).

Surprisingly, we also found several shared interactions between the PA-TM-RING E3 ligase RNF167, pleiotrophin, and neurokine family members (

Figure 6

). Most notably members of the PA-TM-E3 ligase family are RNF43 and ZNRF3 which both modulate the WNT signaling pathway by targeting FZD receptor protein homeostasis. Interestingly, both E3 ligases are regulated by the secreted WNT agonists R-spondin (RSPO) (

Clevers and Nusse, 2012

;

Janda et al., 2017

;

Zebisch and Jones, 2015

). Ubiquitin E3 ligases are notoriously challenging to study due to the highly transient, catalytic nature of the ubiquitylation cascade and the transmembrane PA-TM-RING E3 ligase family is no exception with the majority still being orphans and their functions unknown.

In summary, we implemented a proteo-genomic screening workflow, combining CRISPRa pooled cell surface libraries with a MACS enrichment strategy, in order to accelerate the identification of interactions between the secreted and membrane proteomes. We report new receptor-secreted ligand PPIs that are potentially involved in a wide variety of signaling processes. Implementation of cell-based screening strategies based on our approach might allow elucidation of receptor-ligand relationships for many proteins that are currently orphans, and has the potential to identify novel therapeutically relevant targets and define new biological processes.

Curation of the human membrane and secreted proteome and selection of secreted bait proteins

Two lists of human membrane and secreted proteins were generated using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database (

https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/secretome

). Lists were checked for overlap and master lists were generated using the Human Protein Atlas majority decision-based method. Metadata for all master list proteins was extracted from UniProt

https://www.uniprot.org

and sequence information was validated by the SIgnalP-5.0 (

http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/

) (

) (

Pierleoni et al., 2008

) prediction servers. Following curation, canonical protein sequences were extracted from UniProt and compiled for back translation and optimization by GeneArt/Life Sciences Technology for gene synthesis.

Generation of secreted mammalian expression plasmids

Genes encoding curated SPOI were synthesized at GeneArt/Life Sciences Technologies and subcloned into pD649-SPOI-AviTag-6xHis. Genes were subcloned in-frame with the endogenous or HA (influenza hemagglutinin) signal peptide and downstream AviTag-6xHis modules via 5’ NheI and 3’ AscI sites. A MaxiPrep of plasmid DNA was provided at 1 µg/ml in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. For complete plasmid sequences of all 80 SPOI bait expression vectors, see

Figure 2—source data 3

. All plasmids (80) will be made available through Addgene.

Generation of expression plasmids for full-length proteins

Genes encoding full-length proteins were synthesized at GeneArt/Life Sciences Technologies and subcloned into the pHR expression vector. Plasmids contain a kozak sequence, HA signal peptide, a FLAG tag (to facilitate cell surface expression analysis), and the remaining full-length coding region of the gene, followed by a stop codon.

Production of purified proteins

Proteins were produced in Expi293F cells using transfection conditions following the manufacturer’s protocol. After harvesting of cell media, 1 M Tris, pH 8.0 was added to a final concentration of 20 mM. Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) was added to ~5% media volume. ×1 sterile PBS, pH 7.2 (Gibco) was added to ~×3 media volume. The mixture was stirred overnight at 4°C. Ni-NTA agarose beads were collected in a Buchner funnel and washed with ~300 ml protein wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Beads were transferred to an Econo-Pak Chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and protein was eluted in 15 ml of elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole). Proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultracel filters (Millipore) and absorbance at 280 nm was measured using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to determine protein concentration. A summary of the expression yields can be found in

Biotinylation and FPLC purification

Where indicated, proteins were biotinylated as described previously (

Özkan et al., 2013

). Briefly, up to 10 mg of protein was incubated at 4°C overnight in ×2 Biomix A (0.5 M bicine buffer), ×2 Biomix B (100 mM ATP, 100 mM MgOAc, 500 μM D-biotin), Bio200 (500 µM D-biotin) to a final concentration of 20 µM, and 60–80 units BirA ligase in a final volume of 1 ml. Proteins were further purified by SEC using an S200 Increase or a Superose S6 column (GE Healthcare), depending on protein size, on an ÄKTA Pure FPLC (GE Healthcare), FPLC traces for purified proteins used for the CRISPRa enrichment screens and SPR validation can be found in

CRISPRa enrichment screen

K562 cells stably expressing the sunCAS9 system carrying the pooled sgRNA CSR libraries (TM1; TM2+) were expanded and 50 million cells per screen and library were harvested, washed three times with cold MACS (Miltenyi) buffer, and resuspended in 2 ml MACS buffer in a sterile 5 ml Eppendorf tube. Cells were then labeled with magnetic streptavidin microbeads complexed with biotinylated bait protein (50 µl streptavidin microbeads; 1 µM biotinylated protein), mixed and incubated at 4°C for 30 min (tumbling). After labeling, cells were washed twice with cold MACS buffer (300×

g

, 10 min), resuspended in 1 ml MACS buffer and passed through a 40 µM cell strainer, to obtain a single-cell suspension, directly onto the LS-Column (Miltenyi) for magnetic bead separation according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after applying the labeled cells onto the LS-Column, unlabeled cells pass through and are discarded while labeled cells are retained in the magnetic field, the LS-Column is washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer. For elution of positively selected cells, the column is removed from the separator (magnet) and the magnetically labeled cells are flushed into a 15 ml Falcon tube with fresh media (RPMI complete), washed once, resuspended, and transferred to a T25 culture flask for expansion.

Genomic DNA extraction, library amplification, and deep sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated using QiaAmp DNA Blood Maxi or QiaAmp DNA mini kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, genomic DNA was then amplified using Herculase II polymerase (Agilent) as described previously (

Deans et al., 2016

). To prepare the sgRNA sequencing library, the integrated sgRNA-encoding constructs were PCR amplified using Agilent Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase, followed by a second PCR amplification introducing sample-specific Illumina index barcodes and adapters for deep sequencing. Deep sequencing was performed using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300 cycles; Illumina) employing a custom sequencing oligo according to the manufacturer’s instructions:

Cell surface binding assay with streptavidin tetramerized secreted ligand

To examine PPIs at the cell surface, we performed cell surface protein binding assays using K562 or HEK293F cells. K562 cells were used for pre-evaluation of potential base line binding for all secreted proteins used in the CRISPRa screening workflow. HEK293F cells were transfected using Fugene6 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega) with expression plasmids encoding full-length proteins containing an N-terminal tag (FLAG). Two days following transfection, cultures were harvested, cells were spun down for 4 min at 1600 rpm (~400×

g

), washed twice with cold MACS buffer (Miltenyi) and resuspended to a final density of ~3 × 10

6

cells/ml. To generate tetramerized secreted ligands to test for binding to cells expressing full-length proteins, FPLC-purified biotinylated proteins (see above) were incubated with streptavidin tetramers conjugated to Alexa647 Fluor (SA-647) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 4:1 molar ratio on ice for at least 15 min. To assess cell surface expression of full-length or ECD displayed proteins, 1:200 mouse anti-FLAG-647 (CST) or anti-HA antibody (CST) staining of cells was also performed in parallel where indicated. Approximately 150,000 cells were incubated with Protein:SA-647 complexes or antibody in a final volume of 100 µl in 96-well round-bottom plates (Corning) for 1 hr at 4°C protected from light. Following incubation, cells were washed two times with 200 µl cold MACS buffer and resuspended in 200 µl cold MACS buffer with 1:3000 PI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunofluorescence staining was analyzed using a Cytoflex (Beckman Coulter), and data were collected for 20,000 cells. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.4.2 software. All data report MFI. Concentration-dependent binding of Protein:SA-647 to full-length receptor expressing, but not mock control cells, was deemed indicative of cell surface binding.

SPR experiments

SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare). FPLC-purified biotinylated proteins (ligands) in HBS-P+ Buffer (GE Healthcare) were captured on a Streptavidin (SA) Series S Sensor Chip (GE Healthcare). Chip capture was performed in HBS-P+ buffer (GE Healthcare) to aim for ~100–200 ligand response units (RU). Flow cell 1 was left empty to use this flow cell as a reference flow cell for online subtraction of bulk solution refractive index and for evaluation of non-specific binding of analyte to the chip surface using Biacore T100 Control Software (v3.2) (GE Healthcare). FPLC-purified non-biotinylated protein was used as analyte. Analytes were run in HBS-P+ buffer using twofold increasing protein concentrations to generate a series of sensorgrams. Binding parameters were either determined based on a 1:1 Langmuir model or at equilibrium using the accompanying Biacore T100 evaluation software. A table of all SPR conditions for each ligand-analyte pair tested including concentration range of twofold analyte dilutions, injection rate, injection and dissociation times, regeneration conditions, and meta data can be found in

Figure 2—source data 5

.

Data analysis

Deep sequencing results for each round of selection were analyzed using the casTLE statistical framework (

Morgens et al., 2016

). Briefly, casTLE compares each set of gene-targeting guides to the negative controls, using both safe-targeting and non-targeting controls and selecting the most likely maximum effect size (casTLE-Effect). A pValue is then generated, representing the significance of this maximum effect by permuting the results (n=10,000 permutation). Screening results of the final round of enrichment for each of the 20 secreted proteins were subjected to a first-pass filter using the following cut-offs: casTLE-Effect > 2, casTLE-Score > 2, pValue < 0.05. Next, hits outside the secreted and membrane proteome and common false positive contaminants were removed. To predict high-confidence interaction pairs from each dataset, a custom score was then computed for each potential interaction pair by combining all three metrics into one ESP score: (casTLE-Effect + casTLE Score)/pValue. To integrate data analysis and visualization, we used the combined ESP score to rank sort interaction pairs for every screen and created trajectory plots to ensure positive enrichment over the three consecutive rounds of selection for the predicted hits and allows elimination of false positive candidates.

Database integration

Interaction datasets were downloaded from BioGRID (

https://thebiogrid.org

, 4.4.210, physical interactions), Bioplex (

https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu

, Hek293 v3.0 and HCT116 v1.0) and STRING (

https://string-db.org/

; v11.5; physical dataset; interaction score >0.4). To calculate the overlap between all obtained datasets and out own study, interactions were restricted to physical interactions reported and a Venn diagram was visualized (

Heberle et al., 2015

). PHA was performed to generate phylogenetic trees from multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of amino acid sequences of secreted or ECD sequences of transmembrane cell surface receptors (

https://www.uniprot.org/

). Briefly, MSA was performed using ClustalOmega (

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/phylogeny/simplephylogeny/

) which were visualized by Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL;

) (

Letunic and Bork, 2021

). Tissue expression datasets, normal tissue, and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets were downloaded from The Human Protein Atlas (

https://www.proteinatlas.org

; v21.1). TCGA cancer tissue RNA-seq data was obtained from 17 cancer types representing 21 cancer subtypes and were processed as median FPKM (number fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads) and visualized as a hierarchical clustering heatmap using JMP Pro (v16). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of normalized mRNA gene expression by tissue was performed with Ward linkage and correlation distance were plotted as heatmaps using JMP Pro (v16). Tissue expression correlation analysis of normalized mRNA gene expression for candidate genes was performed using multivariate analysis tool in JMP Pro (v16) and expression correlation results were visualized as heatmaps where intense red color indicates a strong positive correlation and intense blue color indicates a strong negative correlation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancer types and accounts for ~ 42,220 new cases, and ~ 30,200 deaths in United States alone in 2018 (for Liver & intrahepatic bile duct)

MYO18B

14

. Therefore, a potential link between obesity, inflammation, myopathy and cirrhosis is evident but not understood in the context of myosin-18B. Myosin-18B could also be targeted by transcriptional regulation and the signaling pathways and components involved in the regulation of

MYO18B

at mRNA level are not yet known. Understanding the signaling pathways and components involved in positive and negative regulation of

transcription is therefore necessary to understand the basics of myosin-18B related progression of HCCs.

A report indicates that

MYO18B

mRNA expression in patients who harbor transcription incompetent p53. In p53 defective Hep3B cells, the expression of

MYO18B

is suppressed by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and that the presence of C19MC miRNA-520G reverses this suppressive effect to promote the expression of

MYO18B

mRNA. Stable overexpression of

CEBPB

mimics the effect of miR-520G in promoting

MYO18B

mRNA expression. Furthermore, wild-type and mutant p53s promote the expression of

MYO18B

mRNA in the presence of miR-520G. On the other hand, basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) suppresses MYO18B mRNA expression irrespective of IFN-γ treatment,

CEBPB

overexpression or miR-520G expression. Thus our study significantly expose the transcriptional regulatory network of

MYO18B

, which in future will help to study the role of these signaling pathways in myopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Results

High MYO18B mRNA expression is correlated with C19MC overexpression and poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma

Deregulated expression of Myosin-18B is linked to HCC progression, stress fiber formation, cirrhosis of liver, and cardiac dysfunction, through defects in myosin-II z-stack formation of muscle fibers (Fig.

1

A). In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, high

MYO18B

mRNA expression is significantly associated with poor survival (Fig.

1

B). We next examined whether

MYO18B

mRNA expression is associated with any of the integrated molecular classification clusters (iClusters) using TCGA iCluster dataset

27

.

MYO18B

mRNA was significantly enriched in iCluster-3 (Fig.

1

C), a cluster known to harbor most p53 defects in HCCs

27

. Furthermore, examination of integrated RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data revealed that,

MYO18B

mRNA is significantly expressed in tumors with high C19MC miRNA expression (Fig.

1

D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, high

MYO18B

mRNA expression is correlated with C19MC overexpression and poor survival in iCluster-3 of HCCs.

Genomic structure of

MYO18B

gene enhancer reveals multiple CEBPB binding sites

To understand the transcriptional cause for the high expression of

MYO18B

mRNA in iCluster-3, we examined the 5′-regulatory region of

MYO18B

gene in UCSC genome browser.

MYO18B

gene is located on Chr22q12.1 and has a very strong enhancer marked by H3K27Ac (chr22:26,137,306–26,162,170: hg19) (Fig.

2

). Transcription factor ChIP-Seq data from UCSC genome browser (ENCODE) revealed numerous transcription factor binding sites within this enhancer which includes CEBPB, p53, Myc, Max, GATA-2 and others (data not shown), but we focused our attention on CEBPB because of the following reasons: (i) CEBPB has the capability to regulate enhancers in liver environment

28

(ii) CEBPB is tightly linked to obesity

5

and (iii) CEBPB sites were also present at C19MC region on chromosome-19

17

.

MYO18B

has 3 CEBPB binding sites within its enhancer region and a fourth CEBPB binding site located upstream to the enhancer region (Fig.

2

). CEBPB is capable of binding to these regions as evaluated by examining ENCODE ChIP-seq data (Fig.

2

). Notably, CEBPB binds to a fourth site close to transcriptional start site (TSS) upon forskolin induction (Fig.

2

). While the CEBPB sites may regulate different isoforms of MYO18B mRNAs, we chose exon-3 of the longest isoform for expression analysis by RT-PCR because it is shared by multiple isoforms of MYO18B mRNAs (Fig.

2

). Taken together these data reveal that, the

MYO18B

gene harbors a strong enhancer with four CEBPB binding sites.

Figure 2

MYO18B

enhancer region CEBPB binding sites and selection of exons for RT-PCR analysis. The

MYO18B

gene location is shown in the chromosome locus “22q12.1” by a red vertical line. The enhancer region of

MYO18B

gene with H3K27Ac mark (Chr22: 26,135,000–26,160,000 [hg19]) in UCSC Genome Browser track (blue peaks) was focused to show CEBPB binding at this region using ENCODE CEBPB ChIP-seq HepG2 data (red and black peaks). Note the three CEBPB binding sites (indicated by red peaks) within the enhancer region (indicated by red box) in uninduced HepG2 cells and a notable fourth binding site close to transcription start site (TSS) in forskolin induced HepG2 cells. One another CEBPB site was far upstream to enhancer region (indicated by green shaded box). The exon chosen for RT-PCR analysis is indicated at exon-3 of long isoform.

Hsa-miR-520G-3p remodels IFN-γ but not bFGF signaling to regulate

MYO18B

transcription

Although

MYO18B

has multiple transcription factor binding sites in addition to CEBPB and a strong enhancer, additional signals are likely needed to activate transcription from

MYO18B

gene. Therefore we screened the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines for correlation to

MYO18B

mRNA expression in HCCs. We chose the cytokines bFGF, IFN-γ, EGF and IL-6 that are related to myopathy and or cirrhosis

29

–

32

, and found that, bFGF is negatively correlated and the remaining three cytokines are positively correlated to

MYO18B

mRNA expression (Fig.

3

A). To understand the effect of C19MC miRNA expression on

MYO18B

mRNA expression we chose miR-520G which is known to promote drug resistance in cancer cells

33

,

34

. Analysis of miR-520G in HCCs revealed that this miRNA is expressed more in iCluster-3 (Fig.

3

B), a cluster also expresses more MYO18B mRNA (Fig.

1

C).

Figure 3

Interferon- γ co-operates with miR-520G to promote

MYO18B

transcription but bFGF antagonizes it. (

A

) One hundred ligands (mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines) that are expressed at mRNA level in hepatocellular carcinomas in complete iCluster dataset (as some samples in iCluster-1 and 2 also expressed good quantities of MYO18B: see Fig.

1

C) were subjected to correlation analysis to

MYO18B

RNA. Note that the cytokines such as IFNG, IL6, and EGF forms positive correlation to

MYO18B

whereas bFGF is negatively correlated. (

B

) 10–90% box and whisker plot with whiskers of 75% transparency, showing the expression of C19MC miR-520G is significantly elevated in iCluster-3 (iC3). (

C

) Hep3B cells treated with 1 nM of each cytokines for 24 h and the expression of

CEBPB

and

MYO18B

mRNAs were examined by RT-PCR (gel images). Note that

MYO18B

expression is suppressed by IFN- γ, EGF and bFGF in parental Hep3B cells (top panel) whereas

MYO18B

is promoted by IFN- γ in miR-520G stably overexpressed Hep3B cells (bottom panel). Real-time quantitative PCR (right bar graph) showing the level of miR-520G-3p expression in control (pMIR) and miR-520G stably transfected cells.

Treatment of Hep3B cells with 1 nM each of IFN-γ, IL-6, EGF and bFGF promoted

CEBPB

mRNA expression while IFN-γ, EGF and bFGF suppressed

MYO18B

mRNA expression (Fig.

3

C). However, in miR-520G stably transfected cells, IFN-γ promoted both

CEBPB

and

MYO18B

mRNAs whereas EGF and bFGF treatment downregulated both

CEBPB

and

MYO18B

mRNAs (Fig.

3

C). The effect of

CEBPB

promotion was stronger in IFN- γ treated conditions compared to the other cytokines tested (Fig.

3

C). The effect of

MYO18B

mRNA suppression was stronger in bFGF treated conditions (Fig.

3

C), which stand in line with the negative correlation of

FGF2

with

MYO18B

in HCC patients (Fig.

3

A). Although IL-6 could promote CEBPB in Hep3B untransfected cells, it could not promote CEBPB mRNA in miR-520G stable cells (Fig.

3

C). Taken together these results demonstrated that, miR-520G remodels IFN- γ signaling to promote

MYO18B

transcription and that bFGF negatively regulate

MYO18B

mRNA expression.

CEBPB mimics the effect of miR-520G in

MYO18B

mRNA expression but bFGF counteracts it

We noted a striking correlative upregulation or downregulation of CEBPB with MYO18B mRNA levels in response to IFN- γ or bFGF respectively (Fig.

3

C) raising the question that, the CEBPB expression level could mimic the effect of these cytokines or miR-520G (Fig.

4

A). Of note, miR-520G overexpression does not alter the mRNA expression of MYO18B/IFNG/bFGF/CEBPB/cytokines receptors compared to control pMIR transfected cells (Supplementary figure

1

A). Complete lack of IFNG mRNA expression prompted us to examine whether IFNG gene is deleted in Hep3B cells. However, IFNG was not deleted in Hep3B cells as per copy number data (Supplementary figure

1

B). To test whether CEBPB expression level could mimic the effect of the cytokines or miR0520G, we stably overexpressed the LAP-isoform of CEBPB (which is known to promote transcription compared to its short isoform: liver-enriched inhibitor protein (LIP)

35

) in Hep3B cells. Overexpression of CEBPB-LAP isoform itself suppressed MYO18B transcription compared to control empty vector transfected cells (Fig.

4

B). Importantly, IFN- γ treatment tremendously promoted MYO18B transcription in CEBPB-LAP overexpressed cells compared to empty vector transfected cells (Fig.

4

B). However, bFGF treatment suppressed both CEBPB and MYO18B mRNAs even when co-treated with IFN-γ (Fig.

4

B). The reduction of CEBPB mRNA in CEBPB-LAP overexpressed condition suggests that, bFGF promotes the degradation of CEBPB mRNA rather than suppressing transcription from CEBPB promoter because the overexpression vector employs a different promoter (CMV).

Figure 4

CEBPB-LAP recapitulates the promotion of

MYO18B

transcription by IFN- γ but fails to do so in

IFI27

gene which lacks CEBPB binding site. (

MYO18B

transcription in parental Hep3B cells versus miR-520G stably overexpressed Hep3B cells. (

) Empty vector (pGIII) and CEBPB-LAP isoform (pGIII-CEBPB) stably transfected Hep3B cells show reduction in

mRNA expression (left panel) but show increased expression when treated with IFN-γ. All cytokine treatments were at 1 nM final concentration for 24 h. The comparison line is to show the reduction in

MYO18B

mRNA between IFN-γ and IFN-γ  + bFGF treated conditions. Note the complete suppression of CEBPB mRNA in bFGF treated conditions (see discussion for more details). (

C

) Schematic showing the experimental plan to test the role of CEBPB in IFN-γ stimulated promotion of the transcription of

MYO18B

that contains CEBPB binding sites versus another IFN-γ target gene, IFI27 that lack CEBPB binding site. Also see Supplementary figure-

2

to see lack of considerable CEBPB binding at IFI27 gene regulatory region in HepG2 CEBPB-ChIP-seq data. (

D

) Empty vector (pGIII) and CEBPB-LAP isoform (pGIII-CEBPB) stably transfected Hep3B cells show no difference in

IFI27

mRNA expression at baseline levels (left panel) or when treated with IFN-γ (right panel). Note: The cDNAs used for panel-

B

and panel-

D

are same and hence the IFN- γ induced changes of

MYO18B

(panel-

B

) and lack of changes in

IFI27

(panel-

D

) are comparable between panels.

To understand whether CEBPB binding site is involved in the promotion of the transcription of IFN-γ target genes, we chose

IFI27

gene which is known to get transcribed in response to IFN-γ

36

but lack CEBPB binding sites or binding within its enhancer region (Fig.

4

C and Supplementary figure-

2

). We examined the same cDNA set that was used for Fig.

4

B (CEBPB-LAP overexpressed and its control) and found that,

IFI27

mRNA was not promoted by mere overexpression of CEBPB or when the CEBPB-LAP overexpressed cells were treated with IFN-γ (Fig.

4

D). However, bFGF abolished the expression of IFI27 mRNA or impeded the IFN-γ induced IFI27 mRNA expression. These data demonstrate that, CEBPB binding is required for IFN-γ to promote transcription as IFN- γ could not promote IFI27 mRNA in CEBPB-LAP overexpressed cells.

The data from Figs.

3

and

4

together demonstrates that CEBPB is sufficient to mimic the effect of miR-520G in IFN-γ induced alterations of MYO18B transcription but bFGF suppresses MYO18B mRNA levels irrespective of IFN-γ or CEBPB overexpression.

Transcription defective p53, increased miR-520G and

MYO18B

expression reflect a lethal phenotype with cellular transformation in HCCs

We next examined the possible reasons why patients with high MYO18B exhibited poor overall survival. In general, p53 defective tumors are the indication for poor survival and p53 defects can be of one or many of the different types (such as copy number loss, transcriptional repression, degradation at protein level, or gain-of-function due to mutations). Therefore we classified HCCs into p53-transcription competent (p53TC) or p53-transcription incompetent (p53TI) groups using a p53-target gene transcription signature that consists of 30 genes

27

and integrated this dataset to miRNA-seq data. Interestingly, miR-520G, MYO18B and IFNG RNAs were significantly expressed more in p53-transcription incompetent tumors than in p53-transcription competent tumors (Fig.

5

A). On the other hand, bFGF (

FGF2

) mRNA was significantly downregulated in p53-transcription incompetent tumors than in p53-transcription competent tumors (Fig.

5

A).

Figure 5

Transcription incompetent p53, increased C19MC miR-520G, IFNG, MYO18B and reduced FGF2 transcription reflects a lethal phenotype in HCCs. (

A

) HCC integrated patient data classified based on p53 transcriptional competence (p53TC) and p53 transcriptional incompetence (p53TI) were examined for miR-520G,

MYO18B

,

IFNG

and

FGF2

mRNA expression. The data are represented as 10–90% box and whisker plots with whiskers of 75% transparency. (

B

) Hep3B parental (top panel) and miR-520G (bottom panel) stably overexpressed cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant p53 plasmids and examined for changes in

CEBPB

or

MYO18B

mRNA expression levels. (

C

) Hep3B cells were grown as monolayers (not shown) or spheres (photo micrographs) for 48 h and examined for changes in

MYO18B

and

CEBPB

mRNA levels (photo micrographs and RT-PCR agarose gel panels). Hep3B stable cells with miR-520G overexpression were cultured as monolayers or spheres for 48 h and examined for miR-520G-3p expression of real-time PCR (bar graph). Note: The high expression of miR-520G in monolayer miR-520G stable cells is set to the value of 1 for fold change calculation purpose. (

D

) Overall survival analysis of HCC patients who display clear p53TC versus p53TI transcription profiles. Survival data was extracted from Oncolnc database and matched to p53TC and p53TI dataset IDs to generate overall survival curves.

Considering the fact that Hep3B cells harbor p53 defects

37

,

38

,

MYO18B

is constitutively expressed at mRNA level in this cell line (Fig.

5

B). Transient overexpression of wild-type (WT) or gain-of-function mutant p53s (R175H and R273H) did not promote

MYO18B

transcription in Hep3B cells but promoted

MYO18B

transcription in miR-520G stably overexpressed cells (Fig.

5

B). Furthermore, sphere formation represents cancer cells with aggressive and transformed phenotype

39

–

41

, therefore, we examined whether

MYO18B

transcription is altered in monolayer versus sphere forming Hep3B cells.

MYO18B

mRNA is expressed more in sphere forming cells than monolayer cells (Fig.

5

C). We further tested the miR-520G expression in miR-520G stably transfected Hep3B monolayer cells versus spheres at 48 h and found that, the spheres accumulate 3.76 (SEM =  ± 0.014) fold higher amount of miR-520G-3p compared to monolayer (Fig.

5

C). Survival analysis of p53TC and p53TI tumors revealed that the p53TI patients had significantly poor prognosis than the p53TC patients (Fig.

5

D).

Taken together these data demonstrate that transcription defective p53, increased C19MC miRNA-520G expression in patients and transformed state of cells and increased

MYO18B

transcription reflects a lethal phenotype with cellular transformation in HCCs.

MYO18B

is negatively correlated to

MYL5

and

MYO1B

expression to reflect survival outcome

MYO18B

is part of a large family of myosin genes which constitutes both myosin heavy chains and light chains to provide structural organization of cells and tissues such as liver. Cirrhotic liver often show abrupt texture of liver and therefore more myosins may have redundant roles along with or against

MYO18B

. Therefore we next examined whether other family members of myosin-18B positively or negatively correlate with

MYO18B

expression. For this purpose we subjected the 52 myosin family member genes from the p53TC/p53TI RNA-seq expression dataset to correlation analysis and found that, many myosins were positively or negatively correlated to

MYO18B

(Fig.

6

A). We focused on two myosins,

MYO1B

and

MYL5

that were negatively correlated to

MYO18B

expression in HCCs and were expressed significantly lower quantities in p53TI tumors compared to p53TC tumors (Fig.

6

A,B). This result suggested that, higher expression of these myosins may reflect better survival and p53-transcriptional competence. In line with this, overall survival analysis based on

MYL5

or

MYO1B

revealed that, higher expression of

MYL5

or

MYO1B

is significantly associated with better survival in HCCs (Fig.

6

C), which is in contrast to high

MYO18B

expression (Fig.

1

B).

Figure 6

and

MYO1B

mRNAs are negatively correlated to

mRNA expression to reflect better survival outcome in HCC patients. (

A

) A panel of 52 expressed myosin genes were subjected to correlation analysis using p53TCTI RNA-seq dataset of HCC patients. Myosins that did not expressed in any of the p53TCTI dataset were omitted from analysis. Note:

MYL5

and

MYO1B

were negatively correlated to

MYO18B

mRNAs. Insignificant correlations were shown as blank. (

B

) HCC patient RNA-seq data classified based on p53 transcriptional competence (p53TC) and p53 transcriptional incompetence (p53TI) were examined for

MYL5

and

MYO1B

mRNA expression. The data are represented as 10–90% box and whisker plots with whiskers of 75% transparency. (

C

) Overall survival analysis of HCC patients who display clear high and low expression of

MYL5

(top) mRNA or

MYO1B

(bottom) mRNA expression profiles. The upper and lower percentages used to extract survival data from Oncolnc database for MYL5 and MYO1B were 11% and 35% respectively.

Taken all the results together, IFN- γ, CEBPB and C19MC miRNA-520G-mediated high

MYO18B

expression reflects p53 transcriptional defects and poor survival in HCCs whereas, high

FGF2

(bFGF),

MYL5

and

MYO1B

expression reflects p53 transcriptional competence and better survival.

Discussion

Cirrhosis of the liver is a major and classical risk factor for HCC

2

,

3

and obesity is thought to play a role in this context

4

. Therefore, the pathways that modulate cirrhosis and obesity may play a role in the prognosis of HCC patients.

MYO18B

has been shown to promote progression of HCCs through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

14

. However, the regulation of

MYO18B

is not characterized in detail. Hereby, we show for the first time that, a complex network of IFN-γ, CEBPB (a transcription factor drives obesity through adipogenesis

5

,

7

,

8

), miR-520G, and p53-defects co-operatively regulate the expression of

MYO18B

mRNA which in turn reflects the poor survival of HCC patients (Fig.

7

). On the other hand we show the interesting negative regulatory aspect of bFGF in counteracting

MYO18B

mRNA expression induced by IFN-γ/CEBPB network (Fig.

7

). Presence of CEBPB binding sites is a crucial aspect in the promotion of

MYO18B

mRNA because another IFN-γ target gene

IFI27

failed to get promoted and lacks CEBPB binding site (Fig.

4

C,D and Supplementary figure-

2

). In fact, bFGF may promote the degradation of

CEBPB

mRNA to achieve the negative regulation of IFN-γ-induced

MYO18B

mRNA expression because, bFGF almost silenced CEBPB mRNA expression despite the fact that CEBPB was overexpressed using a CMV promoter (therefore it is not due to repression of original genomic CEBPB promoter alone) (Fig.

4

B).

D

) Overall signaling pathway that reflects survival outcome in HCCs: based on experiments and clinical data.

Defects in p53 can result in aggressive phenotype involving cancer stem cell expansion through blebbishield emergency program-mediated cellular transformation/sphere formation

33

,

39

,

40

,

42

–

52

. Therefore,

MYO18B

expression may not be the direct cause of poor survival in HCCs but it reflects the poor survival due to its association with p53 transcriptional incompetence and associated aggressive therapy resistance and stem-cell expansion phenotypes. The increased expression of

MYO18B

mRNA and miR-520G in spheres compared to monolayer cells supports this notion. High expression of

MYL5

and

MYO1B

mRNAs indicates an opposite outcome compared to

MYO18B

expression in survival of HCC patients which may possibly be mediated by bFGF-induced counteraction of IFN-γ signaling and therefore, detailed studies on the signaling pathways regulating

MYL5

and

MYO1B

are warranted.

Myosin-18B may contribute to proliferation of cancer cells as targeting

MYO18B

expression is linked to skeletal muscle cell proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis

53

. In ovarian and colorectal cancers Myosin-18B is considered as a tumor suppressor

54

,

55

. However, the C19MC miRNAs and IFN-γ (analogous to inflammatory environment of the cirrhotic liver) in p53 defective background may render it as an oncogene in HCCs as per our data.

In summary, our study identified a complex network of IFN-γ,

CEBPB

, C19MC miR-520G and p53-transcriptional incompetence as positive regulators of

MYO18B

mRNA expression and bFGF as negative regulator of

MYO18B

mRNA expression to reflect the survival outcome of HCC patients.

Materials and methods

The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and iCluster details

LIHC RNA-seq, miRNA-seq data were from TCGA (

https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/

) and an integrated patient data sub-set was used which is based on the patient IDs of integrated cluster (iC1 + iC2 + iC3 = 183 samples). The integrated iCluster dataset was based on the expression of 528 signature genes (200 + 128 + 200 genes from iC1, iC2 and iC3 respectively) as described previously

27

. The TCGA IDs of iClusters were generously provided by Dr. Lee, Ju-Seog (UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA), Dr. Ronglai Shen (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA), Dr. David Wheeler (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA) and Dr. Lewis R. Roberts (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA). MYO18B expression was then examined based on iClusters. Expression of miR-520G was examined using miRNA-seq and RNA-seq integrated iCluster dataset.

C19MC-based grouping of HCC patient data

The TCGA miRNA-seq dataset of LIHC (HCC) was processed to get cumulative miRNA expression of all 46 C19MC miRNA genes (

MIR498, MIR512-1, MIR512-2, MIR515-1, MIR515-2, MIR516A1, MIR516A2, MIR516B1, MIR516B2, MIR517A, MIR517-B, MIR517C, MIR518A1, MIR518A2, MIR518B, MIR518C, MIR518D, MIR518E, MIR518F, MIR519A1, MIR519A2, MIR519B, MIR519C, MIR519D, MIR519E, MIR520A, MIR520B, MIR520C, MIR520D, MIR520E, MIR520F, MIR520G, MIR520H, MIR521-1, MIR521-2, MIR522, MIR523, MIR524, MIR525, MIR526A1, MIR526A2, MIR526B, MIR527, MIR1283-1, MIR1283-2, and MIR1323

) and matched to the HCC-iCluster RNA-seq data set to get RNA-seq and miRNA-seq integrated dataset. MYO18B expression was then examined based on C19MC high versus low groups (n = 61 per group).

Evaluation of CEBPB binding to

MYO18B

and

IFI27

regulatory regions: ChIP-seq data analysis

The CEBPB ChIP-seq data were accessed from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)

56

. CEBPB ChIP-seq data sets with or without forskolin induction in HepG2 cells [ENCODE: ENCSR000EEX file: ENCFF000XPP (fold change over control hg19) and ENCSR000BQI file: ENCFF321NDM (fold change over control hg19)] were examined for CEBPB binding at

MYO18B

enhancer region (Chr22:26,135,000–26,160,000, hg19) and visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV: BROAD institute, version 2.4.10). The data range was kept constant (40) for both uninduced and forskolin induced tracks. For

IFI27

, same data sets were used with same settings but by focusing on

IFI27

regulatory region (Chr14:94,576,511–94,577,956, hg19). The peaks are comparable qualitatively and quantitatively between

MYO18B

and

IFI27

genes within same tracks however, the uninduced and forskolin induced tracks are comparable only qualitatively but not quantitatively.

Copy number analysis of

IFNG

in Hep3B cells

Copy number of IFNG gene locus in Hep3B was analyzed using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) cell line copy number variation data

57

within cBioportal platform with built-in IGV visualization option

58

. The default color code applies to the copy number alterations.

Transcription competent (TC) and transcription incompetent (TI) p53 clustering of iCluster dataset

The integrated RNA-seq iCluster Dataset (described above) was used to generate hierarchical clustering heat map using 30 signature genes that represent p53 transcription competence (includes 10 repressed genes:

and two clusters showing clear differences between p53-repressed and p53-expressed genes across clusters were designated as p53 transcription competent (p53TC) and p53 transcription incompetent (p53TI) clusters. The p53TC group includes 51 patients and p53TI group includes 42 patients. This dataset was integrated with TCGA LIHC (HCC) miRNA-seq dataset and the expressions of C19MC miR-520G, MYO18B, IFNG, FGF2, MYL5, and MYO1B were statistically examined for differential expression using GraphPad Prism software v7.04 (La Jolla, CA, USA).

Survival analyses and statistics

TCGA LIHC (HCC) survival data for MYO18B were obtained through Oncolnc (

https://www.oncolnc.org/

) using 40% settings for high and low groups, and matched with RNA-seq dataset sorted based on MYO18B expression values and selected high and low groups (n = 144 each). For MYO1B, survival data was obtained similarly using 35% settings, matched with RNA-seq dataset sorted based on MYO1B expression values and selected high and low groups (n = 126 each). For MYL5, survival data was obtained similarly using 35% settings, matched with RNA-seq dataset sorted based on MYL5 expression values and selected high and low groups (n = 39 each). For p53TC versus p53TI survival analysis the survival data were matched to p53TC (n = 50) and p53TI (n = 41) dataset where the patient number is one less for each group due to non-availability of data.

The survival data were plotted using GraphPad Prism v.7.04 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox test) p-values were considered for level of significance. The p-values < 0.05 were considered significant and < 0.001 were considered robust significance.

Ligand screening and myosin correlation plots, scripts, color code and statistical significance

Correlation plot to screen ligands [100 expressed cytokines and chemokines out of 136 in LIHC (HCC) iCluster dataset: the mRNAs of cytokines or chemokines that are not expressed in any of the samples were omitted (poor expression)] that correlate with MYO18B mRNA expression was generated using R package ‘corrplot’ 0.84 (was built under R version 3.4.4 and R-studio version 1.2.5019. Ref

59

) by using the scripts > cor(); > mat <—cor(); > corrplot(mat, order = "hclust", addrect = 2, method = "color"); > col1 <—colorRampPalette(c("black", "white", "red")); > corrplot(mat, order = "hclust", addrect = 2, method = "color", col = col1(100)), where addrect = 2 was optional; red = positive correlation; black = negative correlation. Significance was calculated using the codes > res1 <—cor.mtest(mat, conf.level = 0.95); > corrplot(mat, order = "hclust", method = "color", addrect = 2, col = col1(100), p.mat = res1$p, insig = "blank") where insignificant correlations were coded white in color. Pearson correlation was used which comes as default option in Corrplot package.

For myosin family correlation with MYO18B, 52 expressed myosin genes were subjected to correlation analysis as described above but using p53TCTI dataset (n = 51 for p53TC and 42 for p53TI) and omitting “addrect = 2” option from the code. Myosins that did not expressed in any of the p53TCTI dataset were omitted from analysis.

The iCluster or myosin datasets from RSEM normalized LIHC (HCC) TCGA RNAseq were log transformed to the base of 10 before generating matrix table in R. The insignificant correlations were coded white and thus white indicates either correlation value = 0 or insignificant.

Cell line, DNA fingerprinting, plasmids and stable/transient transfections

Human Hep3B cells (ATCC # HB-8064) were cultured in MEM containing L-Glutamine and Sodium bi-carbonate (Sigma #M4655), with 10% FBS (Sigma#F0926), vitamins (Gibco Life Technologies #11120052), sodium pyruvate (Gibco Life Technologies #11360070), non-essential amino acids (Gibco Life Technologies #11140050), and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies #15140122). The cells were subjected to STR fingerprinting as per institutional/lab standards. The cells were then expanded, and frozen. Fresh vials were used after every 6 months or after ~ 25 passages. The cells in culture were tested for mycoplasma periodically using MycoAlert Kit (Lonza).

Glycerol stocks of mammalian expression vectors such as pMIR-CMV, and pMIR-CMV-520G (CR215781) were purchased from Vigene Biosciences (Rockville, MD USA). The control pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro (Cat# LV084) and CEBPB pLenti-GIII-CMV-human-CEBPB-RFP-2A-Puro (corresponding to the LAP isoform) (Cat# LV796074) vectors were purchased from Applied Biological Materials Inc., Richmond, BC, Canada. The lentiviral expression cassettes were used as plasmids for transfection rather than as viruses or with accompanying plasmids to package viruses, because C19MC is a cluster that responds to viral infections. Wild-type p53 (#16434) and mutant p53s p53-R175H (#16436) and p53-R273H (#16439) plasmids under CMV promoter were a gift from Bert Vogelstein

60

. An empty CMV promoter containing plasmid was used as empty control. All plasmids were isolated using Qiagen MIDI prep kit (#12143).

Hep3B cells were stably transfected using plasmids (not viruses in the case of lentiviral plasmids) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies # 11668019) and selected using 4 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen # A1113803) for 2 months while GFP/RFP positive clones were picked, expanded and frozen. For transient transfections, 1 μg plasmid DNA/10 cm dish was used with Lipofectamine for 12–14 h., in complete MEM, the media were washed off, and the cells were then collected at 48 h. duration (from the time of addition of DNA + Lipofectamine complex to cells).

Reverse transcriptase PCRs

Parental Hep3B cells were maintained in MEM but the stable cells were maintained in puromycin containing MEM. The stable cells were plated for experiments in MEM without puromycin and treated with 1 nM of cytokines as indicated in figures for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific #15596026, Waltham, MA, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. 20 μl complementary DNA synthesis reactions were done using 1,000 ng RNA and High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI # 4368814, Foster City, CA, USA) with 1.5 M final concentration of betaine (from 5 M stock: Sigma # B0300-1VL, St. Louis, MO, USA). The temperature conditions were, 25 °C for 10 m, 37 °C for 120 m and 85 °C for 5 m. The cDNAs were then diluted with 30 μl of nuclease free water and then 2.5 μl was used per PCR reaction. For PCR reactions 1 M betaine (final conc.) was used along with regular PCR reaction components. The primer sequences and obtained product sizes were included in Supplementary table-

1

. All PCR reactions were standardized with a denaturing (95 °C) time of 1 min, annealing temperature of 60 °C (30 s) and 1 min of extension time (72 °C), with 34 cycles. The PCR reactions were run on 2% agarose gels with GeneRuler 100 bp DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific #SM0243). The gels were imaged using LI-COR Odyssey Fc imager (Lincoln, NE, USA).

Sphere formation and microscopy

Hep3B cells were plated at high density (500,000 cells/ml) in regular tissue culture 10 cm dish (for monolayer) or in low attachment flasks (for spheres) in complete MEM and cultured for 48hrs with a media change at 24hrs. The spheres were stained with Hoechst-33342 and imaged at 48hrs using Zeiss Observer.Z1 microscope equipped with Axiocam 503 mono (Zeiss) camera. The individual channel images of Hoechst-33342 were pseudo-colored to red, merged with bright field and exported using ZEN 2.3 Pro software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, GmbH, 2011, Blue edition). The final composite was done using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Similar experiments were performed to collect monolayer cells and spheres for RNA isolation for RT-PCR/qRTPCR analysis using Hep3B parental cells or miR-520G stably transfected cells.

Quantitative real-time PCRs

RNAs were isolated from pMIR or pMIR-520G stably transfected monolayer cells or spheres at 48 h using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen #217004, Germantown, MD, USA). RNAs were quantified using Nanodrop, and 250 ng RNAs were subjected to cDNA synthesis using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase with RNAse inhibitor, 10X buffer, dNTPs, (ABI, Cat # 4366596) and RT TaqMan™ Primers (RNU6B Control Assay: Assay ID: 001093 (Cat # 4427975), hsa-miR-520 g-3p : Assay ID: 001121 (Cat # 4427975). The cDNAs were then subjected to real-time PCR reactions in triplicates using respective primers with probes and Taqman master mix. The data were normalized using RNU6B and comparative Ct (Δ ΔCt) method was used to compute the relative expression of miRNAs after normalizing with RNU6B values. Statistical significance was calculated in Microsoft Excel (2010) using t-test, two-tailed distribution, two-sample unequal variation option. The results and standard error of mean (SEM) were then plotted using GraphPad Prism software (v7.04; La Jolla, CA, USA).

RNA-seq evaluation of genes of interest

RNAs from stable miR-520G and pMIR control cells were isolated using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen #217004, Germantown, MD, USA), with an on-column RNAse free DNAse (Qiagen # 79254) digestion as per manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq was then performed in quality control tested RNAs using the NuGen Ovation RNA-seq FFPE System (PN 7150-08) to prepare the libraries and were run on the Illumina NextSeq 500 with a 76-base paired-end read. The adapter reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (v1.8.1) and raw reads were then aligned to human genome (build: hg19) using STAR (v2.5.3a). Gene expression was evaluated as read count at gene level with HTSeq (v0.6.1) and Gencode gene model v28. Gene expression data were then normalized using DEseq2. The genes of interest were then visualized using Microsoft Excel (2010).

3D graphics

3D chromosomes, 3D DNA, images were generated using Lightwave Modeler v11.6.3 and rendered using Lightwave Layout v11.6.3 (NewTek Lightwave San Antonio, TX, USA) and composited using Adobe Photoshop CS5. Other graphic images were created using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

Statistical analyses

Frequency distribution 10–90 percentile type box & whisker-plots and statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software (v7.04; La Jolla, CA, USA). In box & whisker -plots the whiskers are aligned and color set to 75% transparency. For patient group versus group statistical significance analysis (box & whisker plots), unpaired, non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was used. For real-time PCRs student’s t-test was performed with two tail, two-sample unequal variance options in Microsoft Excel 2010. Throughout the study the p-value of 0.05 was considered significant and for frequency distribution box & whisker-plots, p-values < 0.001 were considered as robust significance. The ‘n’ for TCGA data analyses were indicated in figures.

#### MYO18B - Article 2: miR-760 regulates skeletal muscle proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis by targeting Myo18b
<Date>: 2019-10-29

<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory response in the synovial tissue of joints, which affects ~1% of population worldwide (

1

). However, the exact cause remains unclear (

2

). RA is characterized by a progressive erosion of the articular cartilage and chronic inflammation of the synovial joint (

3

). It has been reported that oxidative stress, inflammation and lipid peroxidation may affect the progression of RA (

4

). RA, which is also a common cause of permanent disability, leads to increased medical cost, use of social services and a reduction in the quality of life of patients (

5

), as the disease may lead to joint stiffness, swelling, pain and muscle wasting. A previous study indicated that muscle wasting was an important cause of RA-associated morbidity and mortality (

6

). However, the genes regulating the proliferation of skeletal muscle in RA require additional study.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), are a type of non-coding RNA (21–24 nucleotides in length) that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression (

7

). Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been demonstrated to be involved in several diseases, including various types of cancer, and rheumatic and other autoimmune diseases (

8

–

10

). Previous studies have reported that imbalances in miR-146a, miR-155, miR-223 and miR-16 levels existed in the immune cells of patients with RA (

11

–

14

). Lai

et al

found that decreased expression of miR-760 was affected by tumor necrosis factor-a in patients with RA (

7

). In addition, it has been reported that miR-760 regulated the proliferation and apoptosis of a variety of cells, such as human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and human colon cancer and ovarian cancer cells, by targeting specific genes (

15

–

17

). However, there are few studies regarding the regulatory mechanisms via which miR-760 affects skeletal muscle proliferation in patients with RA, to the best of our knowledge.

Skeletal muscles are primarily composed of different types of fibers (

18

). Myoblasts are precursor cells, which are hypothesized to serve an important role in injured skeletal muscle (

19

). Satellite cells mobilize and proliferate as myoblasts when the muscle needs to be repaired and/or remodeled (

20

). Myosin-18b (Myo18b) is a myosin protein associated with human tumor progression, and loss-of-function mutations of Myo18b have been found in certain patients with nemaline myopathy (

21

). Notably, according to Berger

et al

(

22

), a number of myopathies are associated with molecular defects in sarcomeres, and a complete loss of Myo18b function leads to a complete lack of sarcomeric structure, suggesting that Myo18b may serve an important role in sarcomere assembly. In the present study, it was demonstrated that certain miRNAs were differentially expressed in the tarsus joint of a collagen-induced RA mouse model using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

Based on these previous results, factors affecting the proliferation of myoblasts were assessed. Mueller

et al

(

23

) hypothesized that chronic systemic inflammation may negatively affect myonuclei number and the regenerative potential of satellite cells; however, this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Therefore, additional factors may affect proliferation, differentiation and thus, muscle strength. In the present study, the targeting effects of miR-760 on Myo18b were determined, and it was hypothesized that miR-760 regulated skeletal muscle proliferation in RA by targeting Myo18b.

Materials and methods

Identification of differentially expressed genes

GEO2R (

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/

) was used on the GEO dataset (

24

,

25

), GSE61140 (

26

), to obtain the gene expression profile in the tarsus joint of a collagen-induced RA mouse model.

Cell culture

Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in an incubator with 5% CO

2

at 37°C. The cells were passaged using 0.25% trypsin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) when the confluence reached 50%. Subsequently, the cells were moved to a differentiation medium containing DMEM with 2% horse serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin when the cells reached 75–80% confluence, and then myogenic differentiation was induced via the addition of differentiation medium. The media was replaced every 24 h.

Cell transfection

A total of 1×10

C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in 6-well plates, and divided into 4 groups. The first group consisted of: Control cells, untreated cells; negative control (NC) cells, cells transfected with NC siRNA (sense, CAUGUGGUCUGUCGCAUAAUA and antisense, CGGUACACCAGACAGCGUAUU); and small interfering (si)Myo18b cells, cells transfected with siMyo18b (sense, 5′-GAGCCAAAGAACAAAUAAAUU-3′ and antisense, 3′-UUCUCGGUUUCUUGUUUAUUU-5′). The second group consisted of: Control cells; mock cells, cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (+) (GenomeDitech Co., Ltd.) only; and Myo18b cells, cells transfected with Myo18b-pcDNA3.1 (+) (GenomeDitech Co., Ltd.). The third group consisted of: NC cells; siMyo18b cells; mock cells and Myo18b cells. The fourth group consisted: Mimics control cells, cells transfected with mimics control (forward, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′); miR-760 mimics cells, cells transfected with miR-760 mimics (forward, 5′-CGGCUCUGGGUCUGUGGGGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-UCCCACAGACCCAGAGCCG-3′); inhibitors control cells, cells transfected with inhibitors control (5′-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3′); miR-760 inhibitors cells, cells transfected with miR-760 inhibitors (5′-TCCCCACAGACCCAGAGCCG). The siMyo18b, NC siRNA, miR-760 mimics, miR-760 inhibitors, mimic control and inhibitor control were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.; transfection with siRNAs (50 nM), mimics (50 nM) and inhibitors (50 nM) transfection was performed using Lipofectamine

®

2000 kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM at 37°C with 5% CO

2

for another 48 h prior to subsequent experiments.

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis

RT-qPCR analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of Myo18b, miR-760, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, myogenin (MyOG) and myosin heavy chain IId/x (MyH6) in C2C12 myoblasts. To determine the expression of Myo18b during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, cells were harvested after 0, 1, 3, 5 or 7 days. Relative expression levels of Myo18b, miR-760, CDK2, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MyOG and MyH6 in the C2C12 myoblasts were detected after 48 h of transfection with control, NC, siMyo18b, mock, Myo18b, mimics control, miR-760 mimics, inhibitor control and miR-760 inhibitor. Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 myoblasts using TRIzol

®

reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The RNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs using 1 µg RNA and a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), the reverse transcription reaction conditions were set to 37°C for 30 min, and reverse transcriptase inactivation was conducted at 85°C for 5 min. Subsequently, the cDNA products were used for qPCR using a Light Cycler 480 RT-PCR (Roche Diagnostics) and SYBR Green Master mix (Roche Diagnostics) in a final volume of 20 µl/well. The thermocycling conditions for miR-760 were: 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 70°C for 30 sec. Relative expression of miR-760 was normalized to U6 expression levels. SYBR Green on the 7500 qPCR system (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to determine the relative expression levels of Myo18b, CDK2, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MyOG and MyH6. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene, and relative expression was calculated using the 2

−ΔΔCq

method (

27

). The sequences of the primers used are listed in

Table I

.

Western blot analysis

Following transfection, western blotting was used to determine the protein expression levels of Myo18b, MyOG and MyH6 in C2C12 myoblasts in the control, NC, siMyo18b, mock, Myo18b, mimics control, miR-760 mimics, inhibitor control and miR-760 inhibitor groups. PBS was used to wash C2C12 myoblasts twice. Total proteins were extracted from C2C12 myoblasts using a protein lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 20 mmol/l Tris, 1 mmol/l EGTA, 1 mmol/l EDTA, 1 mmol/l β-glycerolphosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/l sodium pyrophosphate, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmol/l Na

3

VO

4

and 1 mmol/l phenylmethyanesulfonyl fluoride). Following lysis, the lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. A bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) was used to measure the protein concentration. Equivalent quantities of proteins (30 µg) were resolved on a 12% gel using SDS-capillary gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), which were probed with the following primary antibodies after blocking in 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 2 h: Myo18b (cat. no. 36810002; 1:1,000; Novus Biologicals, LLC); GAPDH (cat. no. ab181602; 1:10,000; Abcam); MyOG (cat. no. ab77232; 1:1,000; Abcam); or MyH6 (cat. no. ab185967; 1:1,000; Abcam). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, and subsequently with the goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (HRP) secondary antibody (cat. no. ab205718; 1:3,000; Abcam) at room temperature for 2 h. An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to visualize the signal, and Quantity One software (version 4.62; Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to perform densitometry analysis.

Cell proliferation assay

Cells were transfected as aforementioned. The C2C12 myoblasts were divided into 4 groups as follows: NC group, siMyo18b group, mock group and Myo18b group. To determine proliferation, 2×10

3

C2C12 myoblasts were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured in DMEM with 5% CO

2

at 37°C. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) reagent (10 µl/well) was added at 24 and 48 h, and the cells were further incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the absorbance at 450 nm was detected using a plate reader (Thermo LabSystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

Cell cycle assay

In the cell cycle assay, cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the cells were stained in PBS containing propidium iodide and RNase for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Cell cycle distribution was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest software (version 5.1; BD Biosciences).

Wound-healing assay

Following transfection, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate with complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS). Then, cells were starved in serum-free complete medium for 6–8 h, and a 200 µl pipette tip was used to create a straight wound in the cell monolayers when the cells had reached ~100% confluence. The cells were washed once with PBS. The scratch was observed and imaged under a fluorescence microscope (magnification, ×100) at 0 and 24 h, and the wound width was measured. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay

The putative binding sites of miR-760 in the Myo18b-3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) were analyzed using TargetScan 7.2 ((

http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/

). The site of interaction between miR-760 and target gene Myo18b-3′-UTR was verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. After amplifying and purifying Myo18b-3′-UTR and Myo18b-3′-UTR mutant (mut), both PCR products were cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega Corporation) to generate Myo18b-3′-UTR plamids and Myo18b-3′-UTR mut plamids. The C2C12 myoblasts (2×10

3

cells/ml) were co-transfected with Myo18b-3′-UTR/Myo18b-3′-UTR mut (0.5 µg) and miR-760 mimics/control (50 nM) using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay kit (Promega Corporation) 48 h of transfection on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Infinite M200; Tecan Group, Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to

Renilla

luciferase activity.

Statistical analysis

All data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp.) or GraphPad Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The aforementioned experiments were independently repeated three times. A one-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey's test was used to analyze differences among the experimental groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results

Myo18b expression is downregulated in the tarsus joint of collagen-induced RA

The gene expression profile in the tarsal joint of a mouse model of RA was first determined, and the data suggested that expression of Myo18b was lower in the tarsus joint of mice with collagen-induced RA, compared with non-induced controls (

Fig. 1A

).

Myo18b expression increases during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells

To determine the expression of Myo18b during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, cells were harvested and the expression levels of Myo18b were determined in cells after 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression levels of Myo18b increased significantly on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 compared with 0 days (P<0.01), and Myo18b level decreased significantly on day 7 compared with 5 days (P<0.01;

Fig. 1B

). Additionally, the expression of Myo18b on day 7 was significantly upregulated compared with day 0 (P<0.01;

Fig. 1B

).

Myo18b regulates proliferation and cell cycle progression in C2C12 myoblasts

The efficiency of siMyo18b and Myo18b transfection was determined using RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The results showed that the expression of Myo18b in the cells transfected with siMyo18b was significantly decreased compared with the control or NC groups (P<0.01;

Fig. 1C and D

). However, Myo18b expression in the Myo18b group was significantly increased compared with the control or mock groups (P<0.01;

Fig. 1E and F

).

Subsequently, the effects of Myo18b on the growth of C2C12 myoblasts were assessed. The CCK-8 assay results showed that the cell viability in the siMyo18b group was significantly reduced compared with the NC group at 24 (P<0.05) and 48 h (P<0.01) after transfection with siMyo18b, whereas the cell viability in the Myo18b group was significantly increased compared with the mock group at 24 (P<0.05) and 48 h (P<0.01) after transfection with Myo18b (

Fig. 2A

). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that the number of C2C12 myoblasts in the G1 phase was significantly increased in the siMyo18b group (P<0.01), and the number of cells in G2 and S phase were significantly decreased (P<0.01) compared with the NC group (

Fig. 2B and C

). The number of C2C12 myoblasts in the G1 phase were significantly decreased when cells were transfected with Myo18b (P<0.05), whereas the number of cells in the S phase were significantly increased (P<0.01), compared with the mock group (

Fig. 2B and C

). RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression levels of CDK2 and cyclin D1 in C2C12 myoblasts transfected with siMyo18b were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the expression levels in C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Myo18b were significantly increased (P<0.01;

Fig. 2D

), compared with the respective controls.

Myo18b regulates the migration of C2C12 myoblasts

The results of the wound-healing assay showed that the migratory rate of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with siMyo18b was significantly decreased compared with the NC group (P<0.01). The migratory rate of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Myo18b was significantly increased compared with the mock cells (P<0.01;

Fig. 3

).

Myo18b regulates differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts

The results of RT-qPCR and western blotting analysis results showed that siMyo18b downregulated the mRNA expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas Myo18b overexpression increased the expression of these genes in C2C12 myoblasts (

Fig. 4A

). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of MyOG and MyH6 were downregulated in the siMyo18b group compared with the NC group, and increased in cells overexpressing Myo18b compared with the mock group (P<0.01;

Fig. 4B-D

). These results suggested that siMyo18b decreased differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts and Myo18b overexpression induced opposing effects.

Myo18b is a target gene of miR-760 in C2C12 myoblast

A binding site between miR-760 and Myo18b-3′-UTR was identified using TargetScan (

Fig. 5A

). A dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-760 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity when the reporter gene contained the Myo18b-3′-UTR in C2C12 myoblasts (P<0.01). However, no decrease in luciferase activity was observed when the reporter gene contained the Myo18b-3′-UTR mut (P>0.05;

Fig. 5B

).

Upregulation of miR-760 decreases proliferation and cell cycle progression of C2C12 myoblasts. The expression levels of miR-760 in C2C12 myoblasts were determined using RT-qPCR analysis following transfection. The results showed that the expression of miR-760 in C2C12 myoblasts was significantly increased in cells transfected with miR-760 mimics compared with cells transfected with the control mimics (P<0.01). After transfection with miR-760 inhibitor, the miR-760 expression level was decreased, compared with cells in the inhibitor control group (P<0.01;

Fig. 5C

).

A CCK-8 assay showed there were no significant differences observed in terms of the cell viability at 24 h among the groups (P>0.05), and that the cell viability at 48 h was decreased significantly in the cells transfected with miR-760 mimics, compared with the mimics control group (P<0.05) after 48 h. Cell viability at 48 h was increased significantly in the cells transfected with miR-760 inhibitor compared with the inhibitors control group (P<0.05;

Fig. 5D

). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with miR-760 mimics in G1 was significantly increased (P<0.01), whereas the percentages of cells in G2 and S were significantly decreased (P<0.01) compared with the mimics control group (

Fig. 6A and B

). The percentage of cells transfected with miR-760 inhibitors in G1 were decreased (P<0.05), and the percentage of cells in S phase were significantly increased (P<0.01) compared with the inhibitors control group (

Fig. 6A and B

). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression levels of cyclin D1 were significantly decreased in the miR-760 mimics group compared with the mimics control group (P<0.01), while the CDK2 level was slightly reduced but not significant. The expression levels of CDK2 and cyclin D1 in miR-760 inhibitor group were significantly higher compared with the mimics control group (P<0.01;

Fig. 6C

).

miR-760 decreases the migration of C2C12 myoblasts

A wound healing assay was used to determine the effects of miR-760 on the migratory capacity of C2C12 myoblasts following transfection with a miR-760 mimic or inhibitor. The results showed that the migratory abilities of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with miR-760 mimics for 24 h were significantly reduced compared with the mimics control group (P<0.01). The migratory capacity in cells transfected with miR-760 inhibitors at 24 h was significantly increased compared with the inhibitors control group (P<0.01;

Fig. 7

).

miR-760 decreases differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts

RT-qPCR and western blot analyses showed that the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, Myo18b, MyOG and MyH6 in C2C12 myoblasts transfected with miR-760 mimics were significantly decreased compared with the mimics control group (P<0.01;

Fig. 8A and B

). The expression levels of these genes were significantly increased in cells transfected with miR-760 inhibitor, compared with the inhibitor control group (P<0.01;

Fig. 8C and D

).

Discussion

RA is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes progressive articular destruction, functional loss of joints and related comorbidities of bone, vasculature and metabolism, and thus physiologically affects patients (

28

). RA results from complex interactions between genes and the environment (

29

). Studies have shown that reducing inflammation, inhibiting angiogenesis and inducing apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes may effectively improve RA (

30

–

32

). Skeletal muscle atrophy has been observed in patients with RA, and Myo18b is an important component involved in the rapid formation of skeletal muscle (

33

,

34

). miRNAs have been reported as important regulators of skeletal muscle development and differentiation (

35

). Previously, expression of miR-760 was demonstrated to be altered in several diseases (

36

,

37

). However, the role of miR-760 in regulating the proliferation of RA skeletal muscle remains unclear. The aims of the present study were to examine the regulatory effects of miR-760 during skeletal muscle proliferation in RA, and to determine the underlying mechanism.

RA is associated with muscle wasting, which impedes prognosis. Therefore, promoting skeletal muscle proliferation has significant clinical value for patients with RA (

38

,

39

). Certain genes and multiple proteolytic systems are involved in muscle atrophy (

40

). Furthermore, the release of cytokines during chronic inflammation may promote satellite cell activation and myogenesis that help promote skeletal muscle proliferation (

41

). According to Malfatti

et al

(

42

), Myo18b encodes an unconventional myosin protein which is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles that are associated with nemaline myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Similarly, Alazami

et al

(

43

) showed that a rare syndrome, presenting Klippel-Feil anomaly and myopathy, may have been caused by a mutation in Myo18b. In the present study, it was demonstrated that Myo18b was downregulated in the tarsus joint of RA; thus, it was suggested that miR-760 may have regulated skeletal muscle proliferation in RA by targeting Myo18b. To confirm a link between miR-760 and Myo18b, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed, and the results showed that Myo18b was a direct target gene of miR-760.

Myoblast fusion is a crucial step in skeletal muscle differentiation, and the regulation of genes such as cyclin D1 and MyOG may affect the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts (

44

,

45

). CDKs are proline-directed serine/threonine-protein kinases, which are primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, and intracellular and extracellular signal fusion (

46

). CDKs can bind to cyclins to form heterodimers and promote the progression of the cell cycle. As a type of protein kinase, CDK2 is involved in the regulation of the G1/S phases of the cell cycle in patients with RA (

47

). In the present study, it was demonstrated that Myo18b expression was increased as C2C12 myoblasts differentiated at 1, 3 and 5 days, but decreased on day 7. Based on this result, it may be the case that the rate of apoptosis increases after day 5. In a previous study, miRNAs were found to regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration by altering the expressions of various factors, such as MALAT1 (

48

). In the present study, the results showed that miR-760 overexpression and Myo18b silencing significantly decreased the expression levels of CDK2 and cyclin D1 in C2C12 myoblasts. Additionally, it was demonstrated that miR-760 overexpression and Myo18b silencing decreased the proliferation and migration of C2C12 myoblasts. These results suggested that miR-760 may inhibit the proliferation and migration of C2C12 myoblasts by suppressing Myo18b and thus slowing down skeletal muscle formation. Furthermore, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are the primary MMPs responsible for the degradation of type IV collagen, primarily in the basement membrane close to the muscular layer (

49

,

50

). MMPs are associated with increased motility, differentiation and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Zhai

et al

found that salicin decreased the levels of inflammatory factors and inhibited the expression of MMP-1/-3 in interleukin-1β-induced RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes, thereby improving RA (

30

). Therefore, regulation of MMPs may prove to be an effective method of treating patients with RA.

Skeletal muscles are composed of heterogeneous types of fibers based on MyHC expression (

51

). In patients with RA, varying degrees of muscle mass decline and reduction in cross-sectional area have been reported, and a slight but significant decrease in MyHC content has also been observed (

52

). MyOG, a key transcription factor in myogenesis, plays an important role in the regulation of myoblast differentiation and is critical for the terminal differentiation of differentiated myoblasts (

45

). In addition, a previous study suggested that upregulation of MyOG expression was required for myoblasts to fuse into new or existing myotubes, and that the knockdown of MTMR7 promoting C2C12 myoblast early differentiation was associated with the upregulation of MyOG (

53

). In the present study, the results showed that miR-760 inhibited MMP-2, MMP-9, MyOG and MyH6 expression levels in C2C12 myoblasts by downregulating Myo18b. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that miR-760 may affect skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation by regulating cell cycle and myocyte differentiation, and such a phenomenon may be associated with the regulation or the expression of Myo18b, MyOG and MyHC.

In conclusion, it was revealed that Myo18b was a target gene of miR-760. Overexpression of miR-760 downregulated the expression levels of CDK2, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MyOG and MyH6. miR-760 decreased proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts by targeting Myo18b. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferation of skeletal muscle in patients with RA. There are certain limitations to the present study. For example, all experiments were performed

in vitro

and thus, whether the results are replicated

in vivo

remains to be determined. Additionally, miR-760 targets other genes involved in the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts; thus, the effects miR-760 on the various cellular behaviors may have been mediated via other proteins.

#### MYO18B - Article 3: MYO18B promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
<Date>: 2018-11-3
<PMCID>: 6215340
<Full Text Content>:
Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, representing the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide [

1

]. It is well known that persistent infections by HBV or HCV are the primary inducers of chronic liver disease, thereby resulting in liver cirrhosis and HCC [

2

,

3

]. Aflatoxin exposure and alcohol abuse are also important risk factors for developing HCC [

2

]. Surveillance by biannual ultrasonography is recommended for such patients [

4

,

5

]. Current treatment options mainly include resection, liver transplantation and interventional radiology [

5

]. Although recent advances in therapies have achieved improved prognoses for patients with HCC, it is still involved in a poor survival rate due to late diagnosis [

6

]. Currently, patients with advanced HCC lack effective therapies, representing a unique clinical challenge. Given the current burden of HCC, identifying biomarkers associated with the progression and prognosis of HCC is a promising approach to make early diagnosis, predict prognosis and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

Over the past decade, significant effort has focused on the detection of molecular alterations in HCC [

7

–

10

]. Various kinds of biomarkers (such as AFP, VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor) have been proven to harbor prognostic implications, but only serum AFP has been widely used to complement HCC surveillance and guide treatment decisions [

11

–

13

]. However, AFP levels display limitations in sensitivity and specificity [

14

,

15

]. It is imperative to screen adequate predictive or prognostic biomarkers.

MYO18B

is a myosin family gene located at chromosome 22q12.1. Genetic instability of chromosome arm 22q has been detected in patients with HCC [

16

,

17

], suggesting the presence of a tumor-related gene on this chromosome arm that is involved in HCC carcinogenesis. Zhu et al. [

18

] indicated that tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 22q11.2-22q12.1 may contribute to the pathogenesis and development of HCC. Moreover,

MYO18B

has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation is associated with the progression of lung cancer [

19

,

20

], colorectal cancer [

21

] and ovarian cancer [

22

]. These observations raise the possibility that

MYO18B

is a potential cancer marker. However, the specific role of

MYO18B

in HCC progression is still unclear.

In this study, we firstly identified the expression differences of

MYO18B

between HCC tissues and healthy tissues and its prognostic value using the public data from TCGA database, and validated the results using an independent clinical cohort. Then, we investigated the specific role of

MYO18B

in HCC by experimental technique. This work purposed to reveal the significance of

MYO18B

and its underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of HCC. The result would be of great emphasis for future control strategy of patients with HCC.

Methods

Patients

In this study, we identified the expression and prognostic value of

MYO18B

in HCC using two independent cohorts. The RNA-seq data of patients with HCC were obtained from TCGA data portal (

https://cancergenome.nih.gov/

), which contains 374 HCC samples and 50 normal samples. The other cohort contained a total of 80 patients with HCC who had undergone a resection of primary tumors at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College between 2007 and 2009. All patients were histologically confirmed as HCC. TNM classification of hepatocellular carcinoma follows 8th edition AJCC Cancer Staging system. The patients were followed up for 80 months after surgery. None of these patients received radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery. The clinical information of these patients was listed in Table

1

. The adjacent liver tissue was obtained for control.

Cell culture

Human HCC cell line HepG2 was obtained from Cell Bank of the Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), and was cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO

2

.

Transient transfection

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 10

5

per well. The next day, cells were transfected with siRNA (experimental group, si-

MYO18B

, Cat no. sc-61,119, Santa Cluz Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) or non-specific control siRNA (negative control group, si-con) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacture’s protocol. The transfected cells were harvested after 48-h incubation for subsequent experiments.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or frozen human tissues using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), and was then converted into cDNA using a PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacture’s protocol. qRT-PCR assay was carried out using SYBR Green (Takara, Dalian, China). The samples were amplified as the following protocol: 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Primer sequences for MYO18B and GAPDH were as follows: MYO18B forward, 5’-GGAAGCAGTTAGCTGTCGC-3′ and reverse, 5’-TTGACTGGTCGTCCTGAGAGA-3; GAPDH forward, 5’-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT-3′, and reverse, 5’-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG-3′. The relative quantification was determined by 2

−ΔΔCt

method and normalized to GAPDH. All experiments were repeated at least three times.

Western blot

After 48-h transfection, cells were washed with PBS twice, harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (Termo Scientifc, Rockford, IL, USA) containing protease inhibitors on ice for 30 min. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method. Next, protein samples (20 μg) were equally loaded onto SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibodies (dilution 1:1000) against: MYO18B (Cat no. CBS-PA278900, Wuhan Huamei Biological Engineering Co., Ltd., Hubei, China), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K, Cat no. 4255, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), phosphorylated- (p-) PI3K (Cat no. 13857, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), AKT (Cat no. 9272, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-AKT (Cat no. 13038, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), mTOR (Cat no. 2972, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-mTOR (Cat no. 2971, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-P70S6K (Cat no. 9204, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and GAPDH (Cat no. 8884, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The membranes were washed with TBST buffer three times and then incubated with secondary antibodies (Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, dilution 1:3000, Cat no. 7074, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) for 1 h at 25 °C. The membranes were then rinsed three times with blocking solution and visualized by the ECL detection system. The experiments were repeated at least three times for analysis. The intensity of signal on each membrane was determined using Quantity One software. GAPDH was used as a loading control for normalization of protein quantity.

Cell proliferation assay

After transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 1000 per well in 96-well plates. Then cell viability was detected at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h using a CCK-8 kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) following the manufacture’s instruction. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Microplate Reader, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). All assays were repeated at least three times.

Colony formation assay

After transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 500 per well in 6-well plates and incubated in culture medium with 10% FBS for 2 weeks. During this period, the medium was replaced every 3 or 4 days. After 2 weeks, when cell colonies were formed, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min. Visible colonies were imaged and counted using ChemiDoc XRS image screening system (Bio-Rad). Each sample was repeated at least three times.

Wound healing assay

Wound healing assay was used to measure cell migration capacity. Cells suspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10

5

cells/ml and incubated for 24 h to 100% confluence. A cell-free wound was made by scratching plates with a 100 μl plastic pipette tip. Afterwards, the cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium for another 24 h. The wound widths were recorded after 0 h and 24 h under an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed in 24-well plates using an 8 μm pore transwell chamber (BD Biosciences, Lake Franklin, New Jersey, USA) with/without Matrigel.

In the migration assay, cells (5 × 10

3

) were seeded in the upper chamber in 100 μl serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. In the invasion assay, the transwell chambers were first coated with Matrigel, then cells (1 × 10

5

) suspended in 100 μl serum-free RPMI 1640 medium were seeded in the matrigel-coated upper chamber. The lower chambers were filled with 500 μl culture medium containing 10% serum. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO

2

overnight, the wells were washed with PBS and the cells attached to the low surface were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. Cells were imaged and counted under an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Corp., Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) over five random fields in each well. Each assay was performed in triplicate.

Statistical analysis

Experimental values were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, and were analyzed by SPSS Statistics software (version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The data preprocessing and differential expression analysis in TCGA were performed using edgeR package [

23

] (version 3.20.9) in Bioconductor. The association between clinical characteristics and

MYO18B

expression was evaluated by Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier analysis with long-rank test and Cox regression analysis were used to determine the prognostic value of

MYO18B

in HCC patients. Student’s t-test was performed to determine the significance in cell experiments.

P

< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

MYO18B overexpression involves poor prognosis in HCC

We first analyzed the expression differences of

MYO18B

between tumor and normal tissues using TCGA cohort. Our work found that

MYO18B

was obviously upregulated in tumor tissues when compared with normal tissues (Fig.

1a

,

P

< 0.05). To validate the result from TCGA, we thus determined the expression level of

MYO18B

in 80 pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent liver tissues by qRT-PCR. The result showed that

MYO18B

expression exhibited higher levels in tumor tissues than adjacent liver tissues (Fig.

1b

,

p

< 0.05). These results suggested that

MYO18B

was overexpressed in HCC tumor tissues.

Fig. 1

Relative MYO18B expression in tumor tissues and its clinical significance.

a

MYO18B was over-expressed in tumor tissues (

n

= 374) compared with normal tissues (

n

= 50), which was analyzed using TCGA database.

b

MYO18B was up-regulated in tumor tissues (

n

= 80) compared with adjacent liver tissues (ALT), which was analyzed by qRT-PCR.

c

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that MYO18B over-expression was correlated with worse overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (

P

= 0.001)

To further investigate whether

MYO18B

overexpression was involved in HCC progression, we measured the correlation between

MYO18B

levels and clinical pathological characteristics in HCC patients using chi-square test. Based on the median value of

MYO18B

, 80 HCC patients were divided into high and low expression groups. As shown in Table

1

, statistical analysis revealed that no significant association was found in age, gender, grade, pathologic-N and pathologic-M and

MYO18B

expression (

P

> 0.05), while

MYO18B

expression was remarkably correlated with pathologic-stage (

P

= 0.025) and pathologic-T (

P

= 0.014), implying that high expression of

MYO18B

might be involved in the progression of HCC.

Additionally, the prognostic value of

MYO18B

in HCC was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier plotting with long-rank test for difference. The result showed that HCC patients with high expression of

MYO18B

displayed a significantly poorer prognosis than those with low expression (Fig.

1c

,

P

= 0.001). Cox regression analysis was further performed to analyze the prognostic value of

MYO18B

in HCC. As shown in Table

2

, univariate analysis showed that

MYO18B

expression (HR = 2.993,

P

= 0.002), pathologic-stage (HR = 3.708,

p

< 0.001) and pathologic-T (HR = 3.783,

P

< 0.001) were obviously related to overall survival in HCC, while age, gender, grade, pathologic-M and pathologic-N showed no significant association with overall survival (

P

> 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that

MYO18B

expression was an independent prognostic factor in HCC after adjusting for other clinical variables (Table

2

, HR = 2.132,

P

= 0.039). The results reveal that

MYO18B

may be a potential marker for the prognosis and progression of HCC.

knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells after 72 h and 96 h of transfection when compared to control group (

MYO18B knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells

HCC cells are characterized by high migration ability. To evaluate the effect of

MYO18B

expression on the cell migration and invasion, wound healing and transwell assays were carried out. As shown in Fig.

3d

, cell culture images were captured at 0 and 24 h and the wound gap was analyzed. The wound healing assay showed that the wound closure in si-

MYO18B

group was obviously slower compared with the control group, indicating that

MYO18B

knockdown suppressed the migration activity of HepG2 cells. Transwell results showed that the number of the invading and migrating cells in the si-

MYO18B

group was significantly decreased than that in the control group (Fig.

knockdown attenuated the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells.

Knockdown of MYO18B inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway

PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays important roles in regulating multiple cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and intracellular trafficking [

24

]. To explore the underlying mechanism of

MYO18B

in HCC, we analyzed the protein levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HepG2 cells by Western blot. As shown in Fig.

, the protein levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR had no significant differences between si-

MYO18B

group and control group, but

MYO18B

knockdown significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR, and led to an obvious decrease of p70S6K expression (

P

< 0.05). The results suggested that

MYO18B

knockdown might suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells by inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the expression and prognostic values of

MYO18B

in HCC using two independent cohorts, and found that

MYO18B

was overexpressed in HCC, and

MYO18B

high expression was involved in a poor prognosis in HCC. Silencing of

MYO18B

in HepG2 cells could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion via attenuating the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting

MYO18B

might represent a novel adjuvant clinical intervention for patients with HCC.

MYO18B is a novel unconventional myosin heavy chain that mainly expresses in human cardiac and skeletal muscles [

25

]. It is associated with the ATPase proteasome subunit Sug1 and is a substrate for proteasomal degradation [

26

]. Previous studies identified

MYO18B

as a tumor suppressor gene in several cancers [

19

–

22

]. Nishioka et al. [

20

] illustrated that

MYO18B

expression was decreased in 88% of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and 47% of small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, and restoration of

MYO18B

expression can effectively suppress the growth of lung cancer cells. Nakano et al. [

21

] showed that 82% colorectal cancer cell lines presented reduced

MYO18B

expression, which was restored in all 9 by treatment. Yanaihara et al. [

22

] indicated that

MYO18B

expression was reduced in all 4 ovarian cancer cell lines and in 71% of primary ovarian cancers. Yokota et al. [

27

] demonstrated that

MYO18B

was involved in tumor suppression by regulating cell movement and maintaining cell structure. Nobutaka et al. [

28

] found that none of human malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines expressed a detectable level of

MYO18B

, and a restored expression of

MYO18B

inhibited cell growth and increased cell apoptosis. Until now,

MYO18B

remains a mysterious player in HCC. Thus we attempted to investigate the specific effects of

MYO18B

on the progression of HCC. In the present study, we found that

MYO18B

expression was significantly upregulated in both HCC tumor tissues and HCC cell line, and high level of

MYO18B

was correlated with a poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Furthermore,

MYO18B

expression was an independent prognostic factor in HCC. In addition, experimental analysis showed that

MYO18B

promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Evidently, our results were inconsistent with the previous findings that

MYO18B

was a tumor suppressor gene and downregulated in cancer tissues. The occurrence of opposite results might partially due to the tissue-specific expression of

MYO18B

. Moreover, previous studies gave the conclusion based a relative small sample size. While, our finding was drawn using two large independent cohorts, suggesting a more reliable result. Even though, further studies should be performed to elucidate the true circumstance behind the inconsistence.

To explore the underlying mechanism of

MYO18B

in HCC, we evaluated the effect of

MYO18B

on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is a major activated signaling pathway in human malignancies, and regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration [

29

–

31

]. The PI3K/Akt pathway is a key regulator of cell survival via inhibition of apoptosis in various types of human cancers [

32

–

34

]. Akt activation promotes metastasis and invasion of cancer cells, and phosphorylates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [

35

]. mTOR is an important downstream target of PI3K/Akt, and positively regulates the serine/threonine kinase p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) [

35

]. Previous studies demonstrated frequent changes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in HCC [

24

,

36

,

37

]. Components of this pathway are frequently deregulated in an extensive number of tumors, making PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway an attractive target for cancer therapy [

30

,

38

,

39

]. Increasing evidence indicates that inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway suppresses cell growth in many tumor types [

24

,

40

–

42

]. In this report, we found that the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR were significantly suppressed by

MYO18B

knockdown in HepG2 cells, suggesting that

MYO18B

knockdown could inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HCC.

We acknowledge some limitations of our study. In particular, we determined the expression of MYO18B in HCC tumor tissues using two independent cohorts, one from TCGA and one from our clinical patients. In TCGA, the normal liver tissues were used for control, whereas the adjacent liver tissues were used for control in our clinical cohort. Most of HCCs develop in cirrhotic livers, therefore the tumor adjacent tissue is mostly not normal. A further limitation is that some clinical characteristics of these 80 HCC patients such as tumor size, tumor number, and lymphovascular invasion, background liver condition were not included, because the information was not available for a substantial proportion of cases. Thus, the significance and robustness of MYO18B as a biomarker requires further confirmation.

Conclusions

MYO18B

was overexpressed in HCC and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC.

MYO18B

expression was an independent prognostic factor in HCC.

MYO18B

knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion via inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Targeting

MYO18B

might represent a promising target for HCC treatment.

#### MYO18B - Article 4: Are the class 18 myosins Myo18A and Myo18B specialist sarcomeric proteins?
<Date>: 2024-5-09

Introduction

In mouse and human, the myosin superfamily of motor proteins is divided into 12 classes. Conventional class 2 myosins have long coiled-coil domains which mediate dimerization and assembly into bipolar (thick) filaments, whereas the other 11 classes are collectively referred to as unconventional myosins and serve various specific roles (

Kalhammer and Bähler, 2000

;

Sellers, 2000

;

Hartman et al., 2011

;

Maravillas-Montero and Santos-Argumedo, 2012

;

Batters and Veigel, 2016

;

Coluccio, 2020

). All myosins contain a conserved head (motor) domain which typically exhibits ATPase activity and binds to filamentous actin (F-actin), enabling the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to be converted to force production (

Mermall et al., 1998

;

Sellers, 2000

). Class 18 myosins are encoded by two genes:

Myo18a

and

Myo18b

in mice, and

MYO18A

and

MYO18B

in humans (

Bruford et al., 2020

). Extensive biochemical analyses of purified myosin 18A (Myo18A) and myosin 18B (Myo18B) proteins or protein fragments have revealed, surprisingly, that these myosins exhibit negligible ATPase activity (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

;

Taft et al., 2013

;

Latham et al., 2020

;

Taft and Latham, 2020

), perhaps barely sufficient to justify membership in the myosin superfamily. Nevertheless, class 18 myosins have strong phylogenetic roots and show localization to actin-based structures, such as actin stress fibers and sarcomeres (

Salamon et al., 2003

;

Mori et al., 2005

;

Ajima et al., 2008

;

Billington et al., 2015

;

Horsthemke et al., 2019

;

Latham et al., 2020

;

Taft and Latham, 2020

;

Ouyang et al., 2021

). Whether Myo18A and Myo18B exhibit ATPase activity in their natural environment remains to be clarified. Alternatively, these proteins may act as scaffold proteins or inhibitors (brakes) to actin translation by bipolar myosin two filaments, among other functions. In this review, we contend that Myo18B and the gamma-isoform of Myo18A, Myo18Aγ, have evolved as indispensible structural elements or regulators of sarcomeres. We also discuss the diverse functions ascribed to the PDZ-containing alpha-isoform of Myo18A, Myo18Aα, and we briefly speculate on the roles of the beta-isoform, Myo18Aβ.

Myosin 18A

Myo18A was first identified over two decades ago (

Furusawa et al., 2000

). In 2000, Furusawa et al. (

Furusawa et al., 2000

) cloned a novel myosin, which was initially denoted MysPDZ (myosin containing PDZ) since it harbors an N-terminal extension containing a PDZ domain in addition to a KE (lysine and glutamic acid)-rich sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed that MysPDZ (7.5 kb transcript), now known as Myo18Aα, is widely expressed in mouse tissues, whereas a 7.0 kb transcript is additionally expressed in hematopoietic cells and a 10.5 kb transcript is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. In further work, Mori et al. (

Mori et al., 2003

) showed that the 7.0 kb transcript corresponds to an isoform lacking the PDZ-containing N-terminal extension, which was denoted MysPDZβ, as distinct from MysPDZα (MysPDZ), and is now denoted Myo18Aβ. Fluorescence imaging of either Myo18A labeled with antibodies against the coiled-coil domain or expressed YFP-tagged Myo18A constructs revealed that MysPDZα (Myo18Aα) localizes to the perinuclear region, possibly corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and the actin cytoskeleton, whereas MysPDZβ (Myo18Aβ) localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm. Truncation mutants fused to YFP or a Myc tag (also known as c-Myc tag) indicated that the KE-rich sequence was required for localization to F-actin, whereas the PDZ domain mediated localization to the plasma membrane (

Mori et al., 2005

).

The physiological roles of the widely expressed PDZ-containing myosin Myo18Aα have not yet been conclusively established. PDZ domains typically function as scaffolding modules (molecular glue), mediating protein-protein interactions and often localizing proteins to specific subcellular locations (

Bezprozvanny and Maximov, 2001

;

Liu and Fuentes, 2019

). These domains recognize short peptide motifs at the C-terminus of their target proteins, which include membrane-bound receptors and ion channels. Using anti-surfactant protein A receptor 210 antibodies, affinity chromatography, and mass spectrometry, Yang et al. (

Yang et al., 2005

) deduced that Myo18A is the molecular correlate of surfactant protein A receptor 210, which mediates the clearance of pathogens opsonized with surfactant protein A, a collectin secreted by alveolar epithelial type II cells (

Casals et al., 2018

;

King and Chen, 2020

). The authors identified a putative transmembrane α-helix in the head domain of Myo18A, suggesting that it is a single-pass membrane protein. Moreover, antibodies targeted to the neck domain of Myo18A blocked the binding of surfactant protein A to macrophages, implying that the N-terminus is on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. The apparent minimal ATPase activity of Myo18A (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

;

Taft et al., 2013

) would support a potential role of Myo18A as a membrane-bound receptor. Macrophages predominantly express Myo18Aβ (

Horsthemke et al., 2019

) which would be expected to bind surfactant protein A without further action, whereas expression of Myo18Aα, which occurs, for example, following activation of macrophages with leukemia inhibitory factor (

Mori et al., 2003

), is probably required to recruit proteins via its cytosolic PDZ domain and initiate phagocytosis. More recently, macrophages isolated from myeloid-restricted

Myo18a

conditional knockout mice were shown to exhibit normal motility, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, but, unfortunately, surfactant protein A binding or phagocytosis mediated by surfactant protein A opsonization were not investigated (

Horsthemke et al., 2019

). However, RAW 264.7 cells (macrophage cell line) stably transfected with a dominantly negative truncated Myo18Aα mutant exhibited markedly impaired uptake of surfactant protein A-opsonized

Staphylococcus aureus

(

Sever-Chroneos et al., 2011

). On the contrary, the diffuse cytosolic localization of N-terminally YFP-tagged Myo18Aβ (

Mori et al., 2003

), which corresponds to the short variant of surfactant protein A receptor 210 (

Yang et al., 2005

), argues against a role for Myo18A isoforms as plasma membrane receptors. Lack of membrane localization of YFP-Myo18Aβ cannot be explained by an inhibitory effect of the fluorescent protein tag since N-terminally YFP-tagged Myo18Aα localizes to the plasma membrane (

Mori et al., 2003

). Further investigations are necessary to confirm whether Myo18A is indeed a transmembrane protein which binds surfactant protein A-opsonized particles. However, it is most unlikely that the Myo18A head domain spans the plasma membrane since this would require extensive unfolding of this highly conserved structure.

In 2009,

Dippold et al. (2009)

reported that Myo18A, identified by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, is a binding partner of GOLPH3 (Golgi phosphoprotein 3). When Myo18A was knocked down in HeLa cells using siRNA, it mimicked the effects of GOLPH3 knockdown by inducing a more condensed (less stretched) Golgi structure and reducing vesicle budding. Expression of GFP-tagged mouse Myo18A, predicted to be resistant to the siRNA used to target human Myo18A, rescued the Golgi morphology phenotype, whereas a motor mutant (lacking ATPase activity) failed to rescue the phenotype. These data implied a model in which Myo18A is linked to Golgi via GOLPH3 and binds to actin filaments to exert force (actomyosin-ATPase activity) and produce a flattened stack of cisternae, the characteristic morphology of the Golgi apparatus. At variance with this model, two independent groups showed that Myo18A binds weakly to F-actin, but only exhibits negligible ATPase activity, even in the presence of GOLPH3 (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

;

Taft et al., 2013

;

Bruun et al., 2017

). Indeed,

in vitro

gliding assays revealed that Myo18A inhibits the translocation of actin filaments by class 2 myosin (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

). However,

Taft et al. (2013)

showed that GOLPH3 interacts with the PDZ domain of Myo18A and increases its affinity for actin. One possibility to explain the incongruent findings is that mixed bipolar filaments containing both nonmuscle myosin 2 and Myo18Aα (

Billington et al., 2015

) could provide a means for stretching Golgi cisternae. In this scenario, nonmuscle myosin 2 exerts force and Myo18Aα binds to GOLPH3 and acts as an F-actin tethering protein (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

;

Taft et al., 2013

), along the lines schematically illustrated by

Billington et al. (2015)

.

Bruun et al. (2017)

re-investigated the role of Myo18A in Golgi morphology and found using two different anti-Myo18A C-terminus antibodies that endogenous Myo18A, as well as GFP-tagged Myo18Aα, did not localize to Golgi. The authors also showed that knockdown of Myo18A using shRNA did not affect Golgi morphology. Similarly,

Horsthemke et al. (2019)

observed no differences in the Golgi morphology of resident peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild-type and myeloid-restricted

Myo18a

conditional knockout mice. Thus, although Myo18A interacts with Golgi proteins, the extent and functional importance of Myo18A localization to Golgi remains to be clarified.

Various studies have implicated Myo18A in cell motility.

Tan et al. (2008)

deduced that Myo18A is part of a tripartite protein complex essential for cell motility. This complex, which also includes LRAP35a (leucine repeat adapter protein 35a), encoded by

LURAP1

and also known as leucine rich adaptor protein 1, and MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase), encoded by

CDC42BPA

and also known as CDC42-binding protein kinase alpha, promotes nonmuscle myosin 2-dependent actomyosin assembly and retrograde actomyosin flow. The authors stressed that the Myo18A-containing tripartite protein complex localizes to retrograde moving actomyosin bundles in the lamella, which consist of nonmuscle myosin 2-rich actin arcs and dorsal stress fibers (

Burnette et al., 2014

), but not actin stress fibers, also known as ventral stress fibers or subnuclear actin stress fibers, which contain nonmuscle myosin 2 and are anchored to the substrate at each end by focal adhesions. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Myo18A led to loss of actomyosin structures in the lamella. Moreover, MRCK localization to the lamella was decreased by either knockdown of Myo18A or introduction of a motor mutant (lacking ATPase activity) of Myo18A. Using U2OS cells (human epithelial cell line derived from an osteosarcoma) and wound-healing assays,

Tan et al. (2008)

also showed that microinjection of a dominant-negative construct of Myo18A inhibited cell migration. These data suggest that Myo18A is required for the formation and/or maintenance of nonmuscle myosin 2-containing actin arcs and dorsal stress fibers. In accord with

Tan et al. (2008)

,

Billington et al. (2015)

clearly showed using confocal microscopy that GFP-tagged Myo18Aα and GFP-tagged Myo18Aβ colocalized with tdTomato-tagged nonmuscle myosin 2A in lamellar protrusions of U2OS cells, but GFP-tagged Myo18Aα additionally localized to subnuclear actin stress fibers. The authors also showed by co-sedimentation and electron microscopy that polymerization of nonmuscle myosin 2A with Myo18Aβ produced mixed bipolar filaments. Indeed, mixed bipolar filaments containing nonmuscle myosin 2A together with Myo18Aα or Myo18Aβ could be resolved in cells using superresolution imaging, obtained by TIRF-SIM (combined total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM)). Thus, imaging by various independent groups strongly supports the notion that Myo18Aα associates with nonmuscle myosin 2-containing stress fibers, but there are conflicting results in relation to Myo18Aβ (

Mori et al., 2005

;

Billington et al., 2015

). We assume that the N-terminal extension of Myo18Aα, lacking in Myo18Aβ, is required for localization to actin stress structures. The role of Myo18Aβ remains unclear, although it has been shown to form antiparallel dimers in high-salt buffer (

Billington et al., 2015

) and may heterodimerize with Myo18Aα. Further work is required to clarify the subcellular localization and function of Myo18Aβ.

Myo18A was also implicated in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility by

Hsu et al. (2010)

, who identified Myo18A as an interaction partner of PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. PAKs are a family (PAK1–PAK6) of serine/threonine kinases which interact with and are thought to be important downstream targets of the p21 Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, each of which induce actin polymerization and membrane protrusions and are key mediators of cell motility and chemotactic navigation (

Lawson and Ridley, 2018

). The authors deduced that PAK2 binds to Myo18A via the βPIX/GIT1 (β-PAK-interacting exchange factor and G protein-coupled receptor kinases interactor 1) complex. βPIX, encoded by

ARHGEF7

(Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7), interacts with group I PAKs (PAK1–PAK3) though its N-terminal SH3 (Src homology 3) domain. This interaction leads to the activation of Rac and Cdc42 via the Dbl-homology (DH) domain of βPIX, which serves as a selective GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for Rac and Cdc42. Following guanine nucleotide exchange, Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP activate group I PAKs, which in turn inhibit cofilin via LIM kinases, among other functions. Thus, βPIX not only activates Rac and Cdc42 but also serves as a link to their downstream targets (PAK1–PAK3).

Hsu et al. (2010)

showed that knockdown of Myo18A did not impair the formation of PAK/βPIX/GIT1 complexes, but induced morphological changes, including marked cell spreading and a reduction in dorsal ruffles, as well as decreased cell migration in wound healing assays. Truncation mutant analysis indicated that the C-terminus of Myo18Aα, also present in Myo18Aβ, interacts with βPIX. In complementary work,

Hsu et al. (2014)

showed that deletion of the C-terminal extension impairs cellular localization of βPIX in A431 cells and decreases cell motility. Consistent with these findings, Myo18Aα was shown to target the Rac-/Cdc42-GEF βPIX to the dendritic spines of cultured Purkinje neurons, whereas knockdown of Myo18Aα or deletion of the C-terminal Myo18Aα-binding site of βPIX markedly decreased βPIX enrichment in spines, which was associated with loss of F-actin and nonmuscle myosin 2 in these structures (

Alexander et al., 2021

). Thus, Myo18Aα and possibly also Myo18Aβ localize to nonmuscle myosin 2-containing stress fibers and interact with proteins that regulate actin dynamics. To gain further insight, phenotypic analysis of mice selectively lacking both Myo18A isoforms would be most helpful, especially if homozygous mutants prove to be viable.

In developing zebrafish embryos,

myo18a

genes,

myo18aa

and

myo18ab

, were observed to be expressed in the somites (

Cao et al., 2014

). Knockdown of either gene resulted in mildly irregular localization of dystrophin and α-dystroglycan, two key proteins involved in linking F-actin to the extracellular matrix. This irregularity manifested as unsharp somite demarcations and was associated with disrupted myofibers (skeletal muscle cells), identified using anti-slow myosin heavy chain antibodies. Simultaneous knockdown of both genes or overexpression of the PDZ-containing N-terminal extension resulted in a more pronounced phenotype. Further work by

Cao et al. (2016)

showed that Myo18A is required for adhesion of cultured zebrafish embryo myoblasts to laminin-coated substrates. Together with other findings, including interaction of Myo18A with the Golgi protein Golgin45,

Cao et al. (2016)

deduced that the N-terminal extension of Myo18A acts as a scaffold to bind various signaling molecules, link Golgi to F-actin, and stabilize myoblast adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

Deletion of

Myo18a

in mouse is embryonic lethal at around embryonic day 12.5, but surprisingly lacZ (X-Gal) staining indicated that

Myo18a

is highly expressed in the developing heart, as well as in somites (

Horsthemke et al., 2019

). Cardiac myocyte-restricted deletion of

Myo18a

in mice was similarly embryonic lethal and electron microscopy revealed disorganized cardiac sarcomeres in embryos carrying homozygous

Myo18a

mutations. More surprisingly, a novel isoform of Myo18A, denoted Myo18Aγ, was detected in the heart which was larger than Myo18Aα and contained alternative N- and C-terminal extensions (

Horsthemke et al., 2019

). Notably, the N-terminal extension of Myo18Aγ does not contain either a KE-rich sequence or PDZ domain, but instead contains a polyproline helix (

Figure 1A

). Myo18Aγ-GFP expressed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes clearly showed localization to the sarcomeric A-band. All of these findings are reminiscent of Myo18B, discussed in the next section, and suggest that each class 18 myosin gene encodes a protein required for sarcomere function.

Most recently, Myo18Aα was shown to immunoprecipitate with GIPC3 (GIPC PDZ domain containing family, member 3) and the authors showed that the PDZ domain of GIPC3 interacts with the C-terminus of Myo18Aα, which is shared by Myo18Aβ (

Chatterjee et al., 2023

). GIPC3 localizes to the cuticular plate of inner and outer hair cells of the cochlea during postnatal development. Each stereocilium of the hair cells inserts into the cuticular plate, a dense network of filamentous actin. SIM imaging of immunolabeled Myo18Aα showed that it localizes immediately below the actin-rich cuticular plate. Mutations of various unconventional myosin genes are associated with deafness (

in hair cells causes significant abnormalities in the morphology and function of hair cells remains to be determined.

Myosin 18B

In a human squamous cell lung carcinoma cell line, Lu24, a homozygous deletion on chromosome 22q12.1 suggested the presence of a tumor suppressor gene within the deletion, ultimately leading to the identification of a novel myosin gene, denoted

MYO18B

, which is structurally related to

MYO18A

(

Nishioka et al., 2002

). Consistent with a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene,

MYO18B

is inactivated by deletions, mutations, or methylation in about 50% of lung carcinomas (

Yokota et al., 2003

). Further studies have shown that MYO18B expression is reduced in various cancers, including primary ovarian and colorectal carcinoma, and restoration of MYO18B expression in pleural mesothelioma cell lines decreased tumor growth and metastatic potential. In contrast, high MYO18B expression was correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma and knockdown of

MYO18B

in HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) decreased cell proliferation and invasiveness. Thus, MYO18B has been associated with either tumor suppression or progression and the role of MYO18B presumably varies depending on the specific cancer type and the cellular context. Interestingly, among prostate cancer cell lines,

MYO18A

expression was shown to be higher in a cell line with higher metastatic potential, and the authors inferred, based on knockdown studies, that effects of MYO18A on actin organization and motility could contribute to metastasis (

Makowska et al., 2015

).

Nishioka et al. (2002)

also investigated the expression of

MYO18B

across various human tissues. Northern blot analysis revealed that MYO18B transcripts (∼8 kb) were expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in other tissues. Using real-time quantitative PCR, which is much more sensitive than Northern blot,

MYO18B

expression was detected in a broader range of tissues, including bone marrow, thymus, and testis. Phylogenetic analysis highlighted that MYO18A genes are expressed in both vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas human and mouse Myo18B genes appear to have arisen from a duplication in vertebrates. Using human and mouse tissues,

Salamon et al. (2003)

similarly could only detect MYO18B mRNA in heart and skeletal muscle using Northern blotting, with higher levels in the heart. RT-PCR corroborated these findings, but expression of MYO18B mRNA could be detected in other tissues, albeit after a high number of PCR cycles. The authors showed that

Myo18b

expression is weak in C2C12 cells (mouse myoblast cell line), but it increases following induction of myogenesis (myogenic differentiation), reaching a peak and leveling off at around day 3 after induction. When cells were stably transfected with Myo18B-Myc, the tagged protein was found to be localized to the cytoplasm, but following myogenesis, Myc-tagged Myo18B localized to some of the nuclei. Localization of endogenous Myo18B to the nucleus was observed in a subset of cultured rat ventricular myocytes, but Myo18B also localized to bands (A-bands) between Z-disks, labeled with anti-α-actinin-2 antibodies, in myofibrils. Notably, Myo18B did not appear to localize to the nucleus in ventricular myocytes exhibiting a prominent banding pattern.

Using anti-human MYO18B-N-terminus and anti-human MYO18B-C-terminus antibodies,

Ajima et al. (2008)

showed that Myo18B localized to actin stress fibers in differentiated C2C12 cells, but localization to the nucleus was not observed. Exogenously expressed MYO18B-GFP, but not GFP-tagged MYO18B lacking the N-terminal extension, similarly localized to actin fibers. Furthermore, the N-terminus alone was sufficient for localization to stress fibers. However, in frozen sections of mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle, immunofluorescence imaging indicated that Myo18B (green signal) localizes to Z-lines, labeled with anti-α-actinin antibodies (red signal). These findings contradict those of

Salamon et al. (2003)

, who found that Myo18B localizes to the A-band, and we presume that the anti-Myo18B antibodies used by Ajima et al. exhibited poor specificity, at least in cardiac myocytes. The authors also generated

Myo18b

reporter knockout mice, but homozygous mutants died around embryonic day 10.5. LacZ (X-Gal) staining of heterozygous mutant embryos revealed that

Myo18b

is highly expressed in the heart, and also clearly in somites. Electron microscopy of embryonic day 10.5 hearts showed developing sarcomeres in wild-type hearts, whereas sarcomeric thick and thin filaments appeared less organized in homozygous mutant hearts, especially in cross-sections of developing myofibrils. Thus, Myo18B appears to localize to sarcomeres and may be critical for the formation and/or maintenance of myofibrils.

Consistent with a role in the heart, mutations of

MYO18B

have been associated with cardiomyopathies (

Alazami et al., 2015

;

Malfatti et al., 2015

;

Mihaylova et al., 2020

). The pathophysiology of the cardiomyopathies is unclear, although loss-of-function mutations of

myo18b

in zebrafish were reported to severely impair myofibrillogenesis in fast-twitch skeletal muscle cells (

Berger et al., 2017

;

Gurung et al., 2017

), suggesting that it may be explained by impaired formation and/or maintenance of myofibrils, as speculated by

Ajima et al. (2008)

.

Latham et al. (2020)

provided insight into the function of Myo18B by showing that it initially localizes to nuclei during cardiac differentiation and then to actin stress fibers before incorporating into sarcomeres. Moreover, recombinant Myo18B heavy meromyosin exhibited negligible ATPase activity and failed to translocate F-actin filaments in

in vitro

gliding assays. These data suggest that Myo18B may be involved in sarcomere assembly in accord with the transition model in which myofibrils arise from actin stress fibers, which serve as premyofibrils and initially contain nonmuscle myosin IIB (

Sanger et al., 2005

;

Sanger et al., 2010

). Immunolabeling of Myo18B in cardiac myocytes, derived from human embryonic stem cells, together with anti-β-cardiac myosin (encoded by

MYH7

) or anti-α-actinin antibodies clearly showed that Myo18B localizes to sarcomeric A-bands, as distinct from Z-lines. The authors also confirmed that Myo18B binds actin filaments and proposed a model in which Myo18B tethers the thick filament to the thin (actin) filament and provides internal resistance to sarcomere length changes. Superresolution imaging by another group (

Jiu et al., 2019

) using U2OS cells suggested another function for Myo18B, which may also apply to sarcomeres, in which Myo18B mediates lateral stacking of nonmuscle myosin IIB-containing actin stress fibers, which notably are thought to be precursors of sarcomeres.

Zhao et al. (2020)

confirmed that Myo18B acts as “glue” for nonmuscle myosin two stacks. U2OS cells lacking Myo18B exhibited a paucity of thick ventral stress fibers and focal adhesions, as well as lower traction forces, when plated on a hard surface (glass), compared to control cells. Moreover,

MYO18B

knockout cells exhibited decreased migration velocity and directionality.

Sequence alignments and predicted structure

Sequence alignments reveal moderate sequence identity and similarity between the shared motor, neck, and tail domains of Myo18A isoforms compared to Myo18B (

Figure 1A

). In contrast, the N- and C-termini are highly variable and exhibit low identity and similarity. One notable exception is the extreme N-terminus, particularly the first 19 amino acids, which exhibit high identity and similarity between Myo18Aγ and Myo18B (

Figure 1B

). The N-terminal extensions of Myo18Aα, Myo18Aγ, and Myo18B are distinctive features of class 18 myosins, and they are likely sufficient for localization to actin stress fibers in the case of Myo18Aα, or sarcomeric A-bands in the case of Myo18Aγ and Myo18B.

Guzik-Lendrum et al. (2013)

previously highlighted significant deviations of Myo18A from conserved structural motifs of the nucleotide-binding pocket in the head domain of myosins, which include the P-loop (phosphate-binding loop), switch-1 (SW-1), and switch-2 (SW-2). Similar deviations can also be observed for Myo18B, as highlighted by

Taft and Latham (2020)

and depicted in

Mus musculus

Myo18Aα was previously predicted and deposited on the beta version of the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (accession number Q9JMH9). As expected, the prediction of the structure of the head domain of Myo18Aγ is very close to that of Myo18Aα (rmsd 0.557).

Due to computational power constraints, predictions were restricted to amino acid residues 1 to 1400, encompassing the N-terminal extension, as well as the head domain. Visual representation of the structure was generated using ChimeraX. For clarity, only the head domain is represented (residues 281–1200). The ribbon representation of the head domain is shaded in gray, except for features forming and surrounding the nucleotide-binding pocket: the P-loop (G473–T480) is colored green, SW-1 (S520–Q533) is blue, and SW-2 (D758–Q763) is cyan.

P-loops are recognized for their ability to bind both the phosphates of nucleotides and Mg

2+

ions. Within myosins, the P-loop contains a highly conserved consensus sequence motif (GESGAGKT) (

Ruppel and Spudich, 1996

) (

Figure 1B

). Changes from this consensus sequence, such as substituting the negatively charged amino acid glutamic acid (E) with the uncharged polar amino acid serine (S) in Myo18A or the positively charged amino acid arginine (R) in Myo18B, may have a significant impact on ATP binding and hydrolysis.

Switch-1 is also a critical region in myosin proteins that undergoes considerable conformational changes upon nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (

Smith and Rayment, 1996

;

Fujii and Namba, 2017

;

Kato et al., 2018

). This was previously demonstrated through alanine scanning, which identified residues in switch-1 required for nucleotide binding and ATPase activity (

Shimada et al., 1997

). Both Myo18A and Myo18B harbor numerous deviations from the consensus sequence motif of switch-1 (

Taft and Latham, 2020

) (

Figure 1B

). Mapping of these deviations in our predicted model (

Figure 2F

) shows that hydrophobic residues replace charged and polar residues: (i) M524 replaces a positively charged residue typically seen in the variable position in other myosin sequences and (ii) A528 has effectively exchanged positions with S520, resulting in a deviation of the consensus sequence from (A520, S528) to (S520, A528). This swap, illustrated by the semicircular arrow (

Figure 2F

), positions A528 closer to the binding pocket.

Switch-2 is another important structural motif which has been deduced to stabilize the closed conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket and thereby promote ATP hydrolysis (

Furch et al., 1999

;

Trivedi et al., 2012

). In both Myo18A and Myo18B, the position typically occupied by the hydrophobic amino acid isoleucine (I) in the switch-2 consensus sequence DIXGFE, where X denotes any residue, is instead filled by threonine (T). However, what is perhaps more remarkable, the presence of glutamine (Q763 in

Figure 2F

) instead of negatively charged glutamic acid at the end of the motif (DIXGFE → DTXGFQ) is expected to prevent formation of a salt bridge with a conserved arginine (R530 in

Figure 2F

) on switch-1 (

Furch et al., 1999

;

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

), demonstrated to be critical for ATP hydrolysis and actin affinity (

Onishi et al., 1997

;

Friedman et al., 1998

;

Onishi et al., 1998

;

Furch et al., 1999

).

Other notable deviations from the consensus sequence in Myo18A are the presence of prolines (P) in switch-1 (P521) and switch-2 (P760) (

Figures 2D, F

), as well as the loop extensions E1024–L1052 (yellow in

Figure 2

), denoted the Myo18A-loop, and G769–A774 (pink in

Figure 2

). Myo18B also contains a proline in switch-2 (

Figure 1B

). These prolines may impair conformational flexibility of the loops required for catalysis. Loop extensions have previously been pointed out (

Guzik-Lendrum et al., 2013

). The large Myo18A-/Myo18B-loop (sequences shown in

Figure 1B

) is not predicted with high confidence, but as depicted in

Figure 2E

, the Myo18A-loop (colored yellow) is likely to hinder nucleotide access to the binding site. The small loop extension (colored pink) at the C-terminal end of switch-2 is predicted with high confidence and causes the whole loop to fold in a different conformation compared to known structures, such as myosin S1 fragments of

Dictyostelium discoideum

and

Bos taurus

(Protein Data Bank (PDB) identification codes 1MND and 8QYU, respectively).

Conclusion

The genes encoding class 18 myosins,

Myo18a

and

Myo18b

, are highly expressed in the developing heart and somites, as well as in adult striated muscle, and deletion of either gene is embryonic lethal around embryonic day 11.5, notably at a time when the need for blood pumping function becomes vital for growth. Myo18B and specific isoforms of Myo18A may be involved in myogenesis, potentially playing roles in the transition of premyofibrils, nonmuscle myosin 2-containing stress fibers, to sarcomeres. In differentiated cardiac myocytes, both Myo18B and the gamma-isoform of Myo18A localize to the A-bands of sarcomeres, presumably via their respective N-terminal extensions (

Figure 1A

). Myo18Aγ and Myo18B most likely coassemble with class 2 myosins at low stoichiometric ratios to form mixed-class bipolar myosin filaments. They may function as scaffold proteins, potentially extending to the thin filaments to provide stability and internal resistance. These putative functions align with the apparent lack of ATPase activity in the head domains of class 18 myosins, although it remains to be established whether this holds true

in vivo

. Whether Myo18Aγ and Myo18B also regulate sarcomere function, for example, by acting as sarcomere length-dependent molecular brakes, remains to be explored.

Ultimately, Myo18Aγ and Myo18B are localized somewhere in the A-bands of highly organized sarcomeres, which have just been resolved at unprecedented resolution using cryo-electron microscopy by the groups of Roger Craig (

Dutta et al., 2023

) and Stefan Raunser (

Tamborrini et al., 2023

). Thus, there is a good chance that the precise arrangements and interaction partners of Myo18Aγ and Myo18B will soon be determined using such state-of-the-art structural data sets.

Assuming that class 18 myosins have evolved to become indispensible components of sarcomeres, the relative importance of PDZ-containing Myo18Aα remains to be clarified. Myo18Aα has been implicated in diverse functions, including Golgi structure and function and surfactant protein A binding, whereas the shorter PDZ-less isoform Myo18Aβ may act as a negative regulator via heterodimerization. One approach to assess the relative importance of the various Myo18A isoforms would be to genetically inhibit the expression of Myo18Aα in mice and screen for phenotypes. Subsequently, if no significant abnormalities manifest, the α-isoform-specific knockout mouse model could be further modified to additionally inhibit expression of the β-isoform, while retaining the expression of Myo18Aγ. That is, phenotypic analysis of Myo18A isoform-specific knockout mouse models may help to resolve the specific functions of the various isoforms.

INTRODUCTION

Congenital myopathies are rare monogenicdisorders characterized by distinctive morphologic abnormalities in skeletal muscle [

1, 2

]. Nearly half of the congenital myopathy patients still await molecular characterization and cannot benefit from adequate genetic counselling and healthcare delivery [

1

]. The identification of additional implicated genes is not only important for molecular diagnosis, but also suggests potential drug targets.

Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital muscle disorder associating hypotonia, muscle weakness, and often skeletal deformities with the presence of numerous nemaline bodies (rods) in muscle fibers [

3

].The disorder has a marked clinical variability, ranging from neonatal lethality to mild and non-progressive forms with childhood and adulthood onset [

4

]. To date, ten genes have been implicated in NM,(

KLHL41

MIM#615731, and

LMOD3

MIM#616112), encoding proteins of the skeletal muscle thin filament or Kelch domain containing proteins [

5–14

].

Although dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies have been previously reported in some nemaline myopathy patients [

15–17

], NM is not typically associated with cardiomyopathy. The majority of the reported cases were genetically undiagnosed, apart from three cases with

de novo ACTA1

mutations, presenting congenital NM and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [

18–20

].

With the aim to identify novel genes responsible for NM with cardiomyopathy, we performed exome sequencing in a severe sporadic case. We found a premature stop codon in the C-terminal part of the unconventional myosin

MYO18B

, and we confirmed the presence of a truncated protein on muscle biopsy. We propose

MYO18B

as a novel NM gene, which should be considered as candidate gene for severe cases, especially if a cardiomyopathy is diagnosed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethical issues, biopsy, histology, and electron microscopy

The parents of the index patient gave informed consent for the genetic analysis and muscle biopsy according to French legislation (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est IV DC-2012-1693). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood by standard methods.

The index patient underwent an open muscle biopsy from vastus lateralis at 14 days of life. For conventional histochemical techniques, 10μm thick cryostat sections were stained with modified Gomori trichrome (mGT). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Periodic acid Schiff technique (PAS), Oil red O, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) at pH 9.4, 4.63, 4.35 staining were also performed, but are not shown. Pictures of each section were obtained with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc linked to a Zeiss Axioplan Bright Field Microscope and processed with the Axio Vision 4.4 software (Zeiss, Germany).

Resin-embedded blocks for ultrastructural analyses were not prepared at time of the muscle biopsy. We therefore fixed frozen muscle sections (40μm) in osmium tetroxide (1% ), dehydrated and embedded them in epoxy resin (EMBed-812, ElectronMicroscopy Sciences, USA). Ultra-thin sections (80 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were analyzed with a Philips CM120 electron microscope (80 kV; Philips Electronics NV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and imaged using a Morada digital camera (Soft Imaging System, France).

Exome sequencing, variants prioritization and mutation analysis

The nemaline myopathy genes

ACTA1

,

NEB

,

TPM2

,

TPM3

, and

TNNT1

, as well as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Prader-Willi syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy-1 (DM1) were excluded by conventional techniques. Exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from the index patient on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, USA) using the Agilent 44M v2 SureSelect Exon enrichment kit at the BGI (Shenzhen, China). Variant calling was performed with the SOAP software. The mean coverage of the exome was 57x, and the percentage of the exome covered at least 20x was 77.2% . Variants with a frequency <20% of the total reads for a specific position were excluded. Variant filtering was performed by comparison with SNV databases as dbSNP, Exome Variant Server and EXAC, and polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of more than 0.5% were discarded. Variant prioritization was done with the VaRank program [

21

]. Sanger sequencing was performed as reported [

22

]. The position of the mutation was numbered according to NM_032608.5 and NP_115997.5.

RT-PCR

The patient’s RNA was extracted from the muscle biopsy with TRI-Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), and reverse transcribed using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and random hexamer primers following the manufacturer’s protocol.

MYO18B

-specific primers encompassing several exons and the mutation were used to assess mRNA steady state levels.

NEB

primers were used as internal controls.

Immunolabeling and protein analysis

Immunofluorescence analyses were performed on frozen muscle samples from the index patient and a control biopsy without histopathological lesions. Anti-myosin 18B C-ter (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-myosin 18B C-ter (GTX104872, GeneTex, Euromedex, Paris France) and anti-myosin 18B N-ter polyclonal (kind gift from Professor Gerolamo Lanfranchi, University of Padua, Italy) antibodies, were applied on 10-μm-thick cryosections overnight at 4°C. The next day, the sections were incubated with appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies following routine protocols. Slides without primary antibodies were used as controls.

Western blot was performed on skeletal muscle protein extracts by routine methods using the anti-myosin 18B C-ter antibody (Sigma), as well as an anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (Sigma. St. Louis, USA) as loading control.

RESULTS

Clinical findings

The index patient was a girl born to healthy consanguineous parents of Portuguese origin. The mother reported three previous miscarriages. Pregnancy was uneventful until the discovery of a cardiomyopathy characterized by reduced left ventricle and aortic valve growth during a routine ultrasound at 22 weeks of gestation. Birth took place at term by natural vaginal delivery. The weight was 2830 grams (-2 SD),the height 49 cm, and the cranial circumference 32.5 cm. Physical examination revealed severe axial and peripheral hypotonia, reduced spontaneous peripheral movements, tendon contractures, and absence of nursing necessitating nasogastric feeding (

Fig. 1

A, B, and C). The patient also presented dysmorphic features including transversal enlargement of the skull, small and horizontal palpebral fissure, high-arched palate, low-set ears, pectum excavatum, large and lowly implanted thumbs (

Fig. 1

A), and clinodactyly of both fourth and fifth fingers of the hands. Cardiac ultrasound confirmed the presence of small and mildly hypertrophic left cavities, compensatory dilatation of right cavities, interatrial communication, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was tachycardic (170 bt/min), and a therapy with diuretics was started. The discontinuation of diuretics at one month of age precipitated hemodynamic instability leading to the sudden development of acute lung edema promptly recuperated with high doses of diuretics and digitalis treatment. Cerebral MRI showed minimal signs of subependimal hemorrhage. EEG was normal. Karyotype was normal, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Prader-Willi syndrome, and neonatal myotonic dystrophy-1 (DM1) were excluded by molecular analysis. Metabolic work-up including serum and CRL lactate assessment, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes enzymatic assay, chromatography of blood and urinary aminoacids and urinary organic acid was normal. The course was progressive with degradation of the hemodynamic and respiratory status, and failure to thrive. The patient deceased at 4.5 months following a septic shock. Autopsy was not performed.

Muscle morphology

Muscle biopsy revealed marked fiber size variability, and a contingent of atrophic muscle fibers was observed. A few of them had a single centralized nucleus. Modified Engel-Gomori trichrome staining revealed the presence of fuchsinophilic inclusions in around 40% of the muscle fibers (

Fig. 1

D). The inclusions corresponded to small nemalinebodies (minirods), found both in subsarcolemmal areas and dispersed in the cytoplasm. The minirods occupied most of the cytoplasm of marked atrophic fibers (

Fig. 1

D; asterisk). Oxidative techniques failed to show unevenly stained areas or negative COX fibers. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of minirods presenting the typical lattice structure of Z-disc material (

Fig. 1

E). In conclusion, the histopathological and ultrastructural findings were strongly suggestive of nemaline myopathy.

Identification of a MYO18B-homozygous premature stop codon in the patient

There are currently 10 known genes implicated in nemaline myopathy. However, a large number of nemaline myopathy patients do not harbor mutations in any of those genes, indicating that additional genes remain to be discovered. Owing to the fact that the major nemaline myopathy genes

ACTA1

,

NEB

,

TPM2

,

TPM3

, and

TNNT1

have previously been excluded byconventional techniques, we performed exome sequencing on DNA samples from the patient. Data analysis did not reveal any potentially pathogenic sequence aberration in any of the 10 well covered nemaline myopathy genes. We detected a homozygous nonsense mutation in

MYO18B

(c.6496G>T; p.Glu2166*), residing within a large homozygous region encompassing the entire

MYO18B

gene on chromosome 22. The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of a second DNA sample from the patient. The mutation was not listed in the human variation databases as EVS, dbSNP or ExAC, or in our in-house database encompassing 676 exomes. Segregation analysis revealed that both healthy parents carry the mutation in the heterozygous state (

Fig. 2

A and 2B). The index patient did not have siblings, and DNA samples from the miscarriages or other relatives were not available. The mutation creates a premature stop codon in the last of the 42 coding exons of

MYO18B

, and is predicted to remove the last 401 amino acids out of 2567 at the protein level. In the human variation databases,

MYO18B

nonsense or frameshift variants leading to a potential protein truncation are rare and never found to be homozygous. This goes along with the idea that heterozygous carriers are healthy and that homozygous mutations may be associated with disease. Other rare homozygous variants detected in the patient’s exome are listed in

Supplemental Table 1

.

The MYO18B premature stop codon does not involve major nonsense mRNA decay

Premature stop codons most often trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), except if they occur in the last or second but last exon [

23

]. In order to assess whether the

MYO18B

p.Glu2166* variant affects the mRNA steady state level, we extracted mRNA from the patient’s muscle biopsy, reverse transcribed it into cDNA, and amplified a fragment encompassing the

MYO18B

exons 40 to 42 and the mutation. No difference was detected in the signal intensity between the patient and an age-matched control (

Fig. 2

C), suggesting that the overall cDNA level was comparable and that the

MYO18B

mRNA is not subject to major degradation through NMD.

The MYO18B premature stop codon leads to a truncated protein

In order to verify the presence of the predicted truncated myosin 18B protein in the patient’s muscle, we performed immunofluorescence on muscle sections using N-terminal and C-terminal antibodies. Immunolabeling with an N-terminal antibody did not reveal any difference in protein localization and signal intensity between the patient and age-matched controls (

Fig. 3

A, and B). Myosin 18B appeared to be nuclear and cytoplasmic. In a subset of fibers, probably type 2 fibers, we detected a more intense punctate cytoplasmic signal. Immunolabeling using the C-terminal myosin 18B antibody revealed absence of staining in the patient as compared to the control (

Fig. 3

C, and D). Western blot analysis using theC-terminal myosin 18B antibody revealed a 285 kDa band corresponding to myosin 18B in protein extracts from an age-matched muscle biopsy, while no signal was detectable in the biopsy from the index patient. Taken together, our results suggest the presence of a truncated myosin 18B protein deprived of its most C-terminal part.

DISCUSSION

Here we propose

MYO18B

as novel gene associated with congenital nemaline myopathy. The index patient presented with severe hypotonia, muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Muscle histopathology was indicative of nemaline myopathy, and exome sequencing detected a homozygous nonsense mutation in

MYO18B

leading to a truncated protein. The index patient was part of a cohort analyzed by exome sequencing and encompassing 34 patients with mild nemaline myopathy, and 17 unrelated patients with severe nemaline myopathy, including two patients with additional cardiomyopathy. The index patient was the only one harboring a

MYO18B

mutation.

Following lines of evidence suggest the implication of the

MYO18B

mutation in the development of the disease: we detected a homozygous nonsense mutation in

MYO18B

by exome sequencing, immunolabeling confirmed the presence of a truncated protein, and Western blot using a C-terminal antibody showed the absence of the full-length protein. Both healthy parents were heterozygous for the mutation, confirming autosomal recessive disease inheritance. In accordance, homozygous

MYO18B

truncations were not listed in the public exome datasets.

MYO18B

encodes an unconventional myosin specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, the two main affected tissues in our patient [

24

]. Moreover,

Myo18b

knockout mice were embryonic lethal, and presented a cardiac dysfunction similar to the patient [

25

].

Interestingly, a recent paper described two patients with Klippel-Feil anomaly and severe neonatal muscle weakness harboring a homozygous

MYO18B

nonsense mutation [

26

]. Muscle examinations detected the presence of nemaline bodies, confirming

MYO18B

as novel gene for nemaline myopathy. Additional clinical features, in particular cervical spine fusion, were diagnosed during childhood for the Klippel-Feil patients, while our patient deceased at 4.5 months of age. A cardiomyopathy as in our patient was however not diagnosed in the Klippel-Feil patients, and this difference might be mutation-specific. Indeed, we detected a truncated myosin 18B protein in muscle extracts of our patient, while the Klippel-Feil mutation was shown to involve nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), resulting in total myosin 18B protein loss. These findings suggest a toxic effect of truncated myosin 18B in heart, but the exact pathomechanisms remain to be uncovered.

An association of rods with cardiomyopathy has been reported in less than 20 patients, all presenting general skeletal muscle involvement as primary manifestations [

20

]. Ten patients developed cardiac failure in adulthood, and six manifested cardiac involvement in infancy or childhood. A molecular diagnosis was available only for three pediatric patients [

18–20

], all carrying dominant

de novo

mutations in

ACTA1

. Two of them manifested hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [

18, 19

], and one childhood-onset dilated cardiomyopathy [

20

]. Intriguingly, HCM was the revealing symptom in the patient reported by D’Amico et al. [

18

].

The cardiac disease encountered in our case was rather peculiar and consisted of antenatal reduced growth of the left ventricle and aortic valve. Soon after birth, the presence of small and mildly hypertrophic left cavities, compensatory dilatation of right cavities, and interatrial communication were noted by ultrasound. If the muscle symptoms, as frequently observed in congenital nemaline myopathy, remained stable, the cardiac phenotype progressed rapidly with the development of congestive heart failure. The presence of a complex cardiac disorder combining multiple malformations and HCM suggested a cardiac myogenesis/development dysfunction. Our patient deceased more than twenty years ago and, histologic studies on autoptic cardiac muscle were not performed.

In addition to the cardiac involvement, dysmorphic features and clinodactyly may represent specific features related to the

MYO18B

truncation, and these signs might be helpful in orientating molecular investigations towards

MYO18B

in patients with nemaline myopathy.

MYO18B

codes for an unconventional muscle myosin heavy chain identified for the first time in 2003 [

24

]. The protein is mainly expressed in human cardiac and skeletal muscle, and at lower level in testis. In mature human skeletal and cardiac muscle,it is localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm [

24

]. Although myosin 18B contains two overlapping C-terminal nuclear localization signals, we did not observe any difference in nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization between the patient’s and the control biopsy. Conventional myosins are known to be localized at the A-bands and function as a molecular motor for muscle contraction. In contrast, myosin 18B was found at the Z-lines of myofibrils in murine striated muscles [

25

]. Noteworthy, most proteins previously found mutated in nemaline myopathy are located at the Z-lines and are implicated in the F-actin pathway. The sarcomeric localization of myosin 18B suggests a possible role in functioning and/or maintenance of the contractile apparatus, and might explain the presence of nemaline bodies encountered in the patient.

Several of the most recent genes implicated in nemaline myopathy encode proteins presumably implicated in the protein degradation pathway, as

KLHL40

and

KLHL41

. Both belong to the BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK) family of proteins, some of which have been shown to promote degradation of their substrates [

12, 27

]. It should be noted that myosin 18B interacts with the proteasomal subunit Sug1 and is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [

28

], supporting the hypothesis that myosin 18B may link the contractile apparatus and protein degradation, representing the two main pathways implicated in nemaline myopathy to date.

In conclusion, our clinical, histological, ultrastructural, genetic, immunolabeling, and protein studies point to

MYO18B

as a novel nemaline myopathy gene. The identification and clinical comparison of additional patients with

MYO18B

mutations will be needed to clearly define the clinical spectrum of this novel entity.

### Gene: TBC1D22A (5 articles)

#### TBC1D22A - Article 1: High Expression of TBC1 Domain Family Member 22A is Related to Poor Prognosis in Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma
<Date>: 2024-10-7
<PMCID>: 11492882
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

GAPs generally contain a conserved protein domain, Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC). This domain was first discovered in yeast cells and is the common conserved domain of the oncogene Tre-2, the yeast cell cycles regulatory proteins Bub2 and Cdc16

1

. TBC1D22A is localized to the Golgi apparatus and has two important catalytic residues, the arginine finger and the glutamine finger, which drive the hydrolysis of Rab-GTP to Rab-GDP and release it into the cytoplasm

2

. According to previous studies, TBC1D22A is associated with recessive genetic epilepsy

3

, schizophrenia

4

, and liver cancer

5

. Interestingly, the role of TBC1D22A in gynecological tumors has not been reported.

Ovarian cancer shows a 5-year survival rate of 48.6% as the most lethal gynecological malignancy

6

,

7

. OSC acts as the most common and aggressive subtype of ovarian cancer, taking up 67.5% of ovarian cancer subtypes

8

. Most individuals with ovarian cancer are identified at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis because the disease lacks noticeable signs and is easily metastasized in its early stages

9

. NCCN guidelines recommend primary debulking surgery in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy as the first choice for patients with OSC

10

. However, most patients with OSC still experience tumor recurrence after treatment. The recurrence rate of patients within 6 months can reach 25%, the median PFS is only 18 months, and recurrence is considered the main cause of death in these patients

11

. Therefore, we need to explore more biomarkers for the evaluation of the prognosis and the adjustment of postoperative treatment in patients with ovarian cancer.

Previously, we performed whole-exome sequencing on tissue samples from a cohort of patients with ovarian cancer and found that platinum-sensitive patients show a significantly higher missense mutation rate of TBC1D22A than platinum-resistant patients. This study thoroughly investigated the association between TBC1D22A expression in OSC and prognosis, immune infiltration, stemness index, immune checkpoints, and chemotherapy drugs. The research was aimed at evaluating whether TBC1D22A is an independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancer.

Methods

Cell culture, chemicals, and antibodies

The China Center for Type Culture Collection (Wuhan, China) offered the human ovarian cancer cell lines COC1, ES-2 and SKOV3, and the human normal ovarian epithelial cell line IOSE-80 was provided by the Cancer Biology Research Center at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). SKOV3 and ES2 cells were cultured using McCoy's 5a. 1640 medium was used for IOSE80 and COC1 cells. The primers below were adopted for TBC1D22A: 5'-TTTGATCCACTGTTACATGGCAC-3'(forward) and 5'-TCCCAGGCATCGCTGTGT-3'(reverse). β-actin: 5'-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3'(forward) and 5'-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3' (reverse). Western blot analysis employed the antibodies below: TBC1D22A (18332-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), GAPDH (60004-1-Ig, Proteintech, Wuhan, China).

Differential expression analysis

The extraction of RNA-sequencing expression profiles, clinical data and survival information of OSC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was made

12

. The genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database provided RNA-sequencing data of normal ovarian tissue

13

. Furthermore, differential expression of TBC1D22A was validated in two ovarian cancer datasets (GSE40595 and GSE66957) from the GEO database

14

. Difference in TBC1D22A mRNA expression in ovarian cancer was analyzed by Wilcox-tests. The R package "ggplot2" was adopted to design the box plot. Experimental procedures for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis were carried out as mentioned previously

15

.

Immunohistochemistry staining

The HPA database offered the immuno-histochemical findings of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues to assess the discrepancies in TBC1D22A expression at the protein level. The antibody number was HPA078026. Twenty-two pairs of ovarian cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology. According to the platinum-free interval, 13 patients were diagnosed as platinum-resistant and 9 patients were diagnosed as platinum-sensitive. Experimental procedures were performed as described previously

15

, and the antibody used was TBC1D22A rabbit polyclonal antibody (18332-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The present study was supported by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital in accordance with the ethical standards in the Declaration of Helsinki (TJ-IRB202402029).

Recognition of prognostic factors in OSC

We evaluated the prognostic value of TBC1D22A, race, age, pathological grade, and TNM stage in ovarian cancer using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyzes. Forest plots were adopted through the "forestplot" package to show

p

-

values

, hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) for every variable. According to the outcomes of multivariate Cox regression analysis, the 1,2, and 3-year survival rates was predicted by establishing a nomogram with the "rms" package. Providing a graphical result of these factors, the nomogram can be adopted to calculate the prognostic risk for a patient by the points related to each risk factor.

Correlation between TBC1D22A and the survival of OSC

We extracted survival data for every sample from the TCGA database. To evaluate the correlation of TBC1D22A expression with the prognosis of patients with OSC, several key indicators were selected: OS, PFS, DFS, and DSS. Based on patient survival information, we plotted Kaplan-Meier curves using the R packages "survminer" and "survival". The association of TBC1D22A with survival was decided by calculating the

p-values

and HR with 95% CI with the log-rank test and univariate Cox regression.

Relationship of TBC1D22A with immune checkpoint, stemness index, and drug IC50

The TCGA dataset provided RNAseq data and related clinical data of 376 OSC. SIGLEC15, TIGIT, CD274, HAVCR2, PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, and PDCD1LG2 were immune checkpoint-associated genes, and the extraction of the expression values of these 8 genes was made. Heatmaps of gene associations were presented using the R package "pheatmap". The calculation of mRNA-based stemness index (mRNAsi) was made with the OCLR machine learning algorithm constructed by Malta

et al.

16

, which was next mapped to the [0,1] scope by a linear transformation that subtracted the minimum and divided by the maximum. Immune infiltration was assessed using the "immunedeconv" R package. Using the R package "pRRophetic" and the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC) database to forecast the chemotherapy response for every patient.

Expression and prognosis of TBC1D22A in pan-carcinoma

We collected RNAseq data and associated clinical data for 33 types of tumors from the TCGA and GTEx databases. Subsequently, a univariate Cox regression analysis was made with the "forestplot" R package. Additionally, we assessed the difference in TBC1D22A expression among different samples through the rank-sum test.

Statistical analysis

R software, version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) was adopted to make all the above statistical approaches and R packages. Measurements are displayed as mean ± SD. Wilcox test was used to compare two groups of samples, and Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare three groups of samples. The log-rank test was employed for the comparison of survival disparities. The association between the two variables was described with Sperman analysis. A

p

value of below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Patient features

RNAseq data (level3) and corresponding clinical information for 376 ovarian tumors were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (

https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/

). Based on the expression of TBC1D22A, patients were divided into two groups, and Table

1

displayed their clinical features. The two groups showed no statistically significant differences in race, age, tumor grade and stage. The Sankey diagram of clinical information for the two groups of patients was presented in

Supplementary Figure 1

.

Differential expression of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer and normal tissues

There were 376 OSC patients in TCGA database chosen as the experimental group, and 180 normal ovaries in GTEx database were selected as the control group. The difference in TBC1D22A expression at the RNA level was analyzed with the R software. Figure

1

A displayed the elevated expression of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer. We then performed an integrated analysis of the 3 datasets (GSE14001, GSE40595 and GSE66957) from the GEO database. And the results indicated that the expression of TBC1D22A was higher in ovarian cancer (Figures

1

D), which was consistent with our findings. We then examined the expression of TBC1D22A mRNA in IOSE-80, COC1, ES-2 and SKOV3 cell lines and found higher expression in the COC1, ES-2 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines than in the normal ovarian cell line IOSE-80 (Figure

3

C).

Immunohistochemical images from the HPA database were analyzed to decide the expression of TBC1D22A at the protein level. The results showed that TBC1D22A was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which was undetectable in normal ovarian tissues (Figures

2

A, B, C) and showed moderate to low intensity staining in tissues of ovarian cancer (Figures

2

D, E, F). We subsequently collected 22 pairs of cancer and adjacent tissues for immunohistochemical staining, and the results also showed that TBC1D22A was upregulated in cancer tissues. However, there was no significant difference in the expression between platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive tumor tissues (Figures

3

D, E, F, G). The results of Western blot analysis also suggested that TBC1D22A was overexpressed in ovarian cancer (Figure

3

A, B).

Prognostic value of TBC1D22A among patients with ovarian cancer

The OS, PFS, DFS and DSS of patients with high and low expression of TBC1D22A were analyzed to assess the correlation between TBC1D22A expression and the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Significantly, our study revealed that OS (

p

= 0.001), PFS (

p

= 0.05), DSS (

p

= 0.01) and DFS (

p

= 0.05) were notably shorter in patients exhibiting high expression of TBC1D22A compared to those with low expression of TBC1D22A (Figures

4

A-D). Another ovarian cancer cohort from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database again confirmed similar results (Supplementary

Figures S2

,

p

< 0.001). Subsequently, we conducted univariate and multivariate regression analyzes to delve deeper into the prognostic significance of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer. In the univariate cox regression analysis, TBC1D22A (HR = 1.44299,

p

< 0.01) and age (HR = 1.01948,

p

< 0.01) appeared as risk factors for the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer, and race (HR = 0.79663,

p

< 0.05) was a protective factor (Figure

5

A). In the next multivariate Cox regression analyses (Figure

5

B), TBC1D22A (HR = 1.57612,

p

< 0.001), age (HR = 1.02584,

p

< 0.001), and race (HR = 0.80699,

p

< 0.05) continuously showed predictive value for patients with OSC. Based on the variables affecting the prognosis of patients, Figure

5

C predicted the OS of patients at 1, 2, and 3 years in the form of a nomogram. By analyzing the pan-cancer data (Supplementary

Figures S3

, S4), it was found that TBC1D22A also has a prognostic value in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), which needs further research in related fields.

Correlation of TBC1D22A with immune checkpoint, stemness index, and drug IC50

To explore the mechanism of the poor prognosis of OSC caused by the high expression of TBC1D22A, the relationship between TBC1D22A and immune checkpoints and immune infiltration was analyzed. Figure

6

A showed a strong positive correlation between TBC1D22A and the immune checkpoints HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2 and CD274 (

p

<0.01). HAVCR2 expression was higher in the TBC1D22A high expression group compared to the low expression group (Figure

6

B). According to the immune infiltration analysis, the content of M2 macrophages in patients with high TBC1D22A expression was significantly increased (

p

< 0.001) (Figure

6

D). Spearman correlation analysis also confirmed that TBC1D22A was significantly and positively associated with M2 macrophage markers CD163(

p

< 0.001) and MRC1(

p

< 0.001) (Figures

6

E, F). These findings suggested that TBC1D22A may contribute to tumor immune escape by affecting macrophage polarization. Moreover, patients with high expression of TBC1D22A had a higher IC50 of cisplatin (

p

< 0.001) and paclitaxel (

p

< 0.05) (Figures

6

G, H) and were more likely to develop drug resistance. Figure

6

I showed that ovarian cancer patients in the high expression TBC1D22A group showed a lower stemness index than those in the low expression TBC1D22A group (

p

< 0.001). For a higher expression of TBC1D22A, tumor cells were likely to be well-differentiated.

Discussion

TBC family proteins are correlated with the occurrence and development of various tumors. Rab is an evolutionarily conserved small GTPases in eukaryotic cells, which mainly participates in a series of intracellular transport processes such as membrane vesicles formation, movement of membrane vesicles to target organelles, and binding of membrane to specific target membrane

17

. The role of TBC/Rab-GAPs in malignant tumors may be directly related to its regulation of Rabs, which can promote the transport and recycling of receptor proteins from cell to cell and cell to matrix, thereby causing cell invasion. Furthermore, many components of oncogene signaling, such as EGFR, RAS, and RAC, are localized to endocytic vesicles or need to be properly transported to the cell membrane or adhesion sites

18

,

19

. TBC1D3 was a GAP for Rab5, which was up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer. Overexpression of TBC1D3 can drive the growth of NIH3T3 cells

in vitro

or

in vivo

and promote the loss of contact inhibition phenomenon. The tumor-promoting effect of TBC1D3 was abolished when the GAP domain mutation of TBC1D3 was inactivated

20

. Bioinformatics analysis showed that TBC1D16 was a melanoma driver gene and could promote the development of melanoma cells

21

. The high expression of TBC1D7, a GAP for Rab17, was found in lung cancer tissues, which can significantly drive the development of lung cancer cells and was correlated with poor prognosis of patients

22

. For all we know, this research first reports the expression and prognostic value of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer.

Recently, in addition to platinum-based combined chemotherapy, bevacizumab

23

and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors

24

have provided new options for treating ovarian cancer. However, these new treatments do not seem to have significantly improved the prognosis for advanced ovarian cancer.

Therefore, more prognostic markers and therapeutic targets need to be sought to improve the outcomes of patients. The current research first demonstrated the high expression of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer. Patients with elevated expression of TBC1D22A show a poor outcome. Subsequently, through a comprehensive exploration of the patient's clinical characteristics, it was proved that TBC1D22A was an independent prognostic factor for ovarian cancer. The possible mechanism by which TBC1D22A affected patient outcomes was further investigated. Recently, immunotherapy represented by checkpoint blockade has gradually emerged in the treatment of tumors and has made significant progress in various solid tumors

25

. However, clinical studies have shown that ovarian cancer is not sensitive to checkpoint blockade, and only 6%-22% of patients respond to programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 antibody treatment

26

,

27

. Research on immuno-suppressive genes and their mechanisms is essential for selecting patients suitable for checkpoint blockade and for using combination therapy to improve the response rate to checkpoint blockade immuno-therapy. M2 macrophages can promote tumor proliferation and metastasis

28

,

29

. Our findings displayed that TBC1D22A was co-expressed with multiple immune checkpoints, including HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, PDCD1(PD1), TIGIT, SIGLEC15, and CD274(PD-L1). Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that TBC1D22A could promote the enrichment of M2 macrophages in ovarian cancer tissues to exert an immunosuppressive effect, and ultimately promoted the progression of ovarian cancer. Therefore, combined use of TBC1D22A inhibitors may improve the effect of immune checkpoint blockade on ovarian cancer, and TBC1D22A may also act as a molecular marker for screening whether immune checkpoint blockade can be used. Platinum-based chemotherapy agents and paclitaxel are first-line chemotherapy agents for ovarian cancer. In this study, it was more likely that patients with high expression of TBC1D22A develop drug resistance, which may be a reason for the poor prognosis of patients.

In fact, this study has certain limitations and more

in vivo

and

in vitro

experiments are necessary for revealing the carcinogenic mechanism of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer, which we are planning to do in the future. In addition, it would be more perfect if a large number of single or multi-center clinical follow-up data were available to further verify the prognostic value of TBC1D22A.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the expression of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer and its relationship with prognosis, immune infiltration, and IC50 of first-line chemotherapy drugs were analyzed in an integrated way. The findings indicated that elevated TBC1D22A expression was correlated with a poor outcome in ovarian cancer and served as a significant independent prognostic indicator. We need to further study the carcinogenic mechanism and clinical application of TBC1D22A in ovarian cancer.

#### TBC1D22A - Article 2: ACBD3 Interaction with TBC1 Domain 22 Protein Is Differentially Affected by Enteroviral and Kobuviral 3A Protein Binding
<Date>: 2013-4-9
<PMCID>: 3622926
<Full Text Content>:
Introduction

Picornaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that replicate on intracellular membranes (

1

). Previous work has indicated that the 3A protein is responsible for the reorganization of Golgi membranes to create viral replication organelles (

2

,

3

). The molecular basis of this reorganization has only recently become apparent through the dual discoveries that enteroviral 3A directly interacts with Golgi-specific brefeldin A resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and that many RNA viruses require the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase class III beta (PI4KB) for viral replication (

2

,

3

). However, many questions remain, as not all picornaviruses that require PI4KB activity interact with GBF1, and the portion of GBF1 required for viral replication appears independent of its known Arf1 guanine exchange activity (

4

).

Two protein-protein interaction screens recently demonstrated that the 3A proteins of enteroviruses and kobuviruses both interact with the host Golgi adaptor protein acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) binding domain protein 3 (ACBD3/GCP60) to recruit PI4KB to viral replication organelles (

5

,

6

). ACBD3 is a highly conserved Golgi complex-associated 60-kDa protein among metazoans that contains a remarkably long N-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain, a coiled-coil domain composed of a charged amino acid region (CAR) and glutamine-rich region (Q-rich), and a highly conserved C-terminal Golgi dynamics domain (GOLD domain) that interacts with the Golgi resident protein giantin/GOLGB1 (

7

). The level of expression of ACBD3 has been shown to be important for the maintenance of the Golgi structure (

7

). The picornavirus 3A-ACBD3 interaction is required for replication, as knockdown of ACBD3 significantly reduces poliovirus and Aichi virus replication (

5

,

6

). Furthermore, mutations that reduce binding of Aichi virus 3A to ACBD3 sensitize virus to PI4KB inhibitors, suggesting that recruitment of PI4KB is mediated by the 3A-ACBD3 interaction (

5

). Intriguingly, a recent yeast two-hybrid screen of hantavirus nonstructural proteins also demonstrated a physical interaction with ACBD3, suggesting that this protein may be broadly required for viral replication due to its native association with PI4KB (

8

). Further study of the cellular function of ACBD3 is warranted to better understand its role in viral replication and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

In this study, we used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify new protein-protein interactions of ACBD3. We discovered a new interaction with the putative Rab33 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D22A/B (

9

). Detailed mapping of the ACBD3 interactome revealed a mutually exclusive interaction between PI4KB and TBC1D22A/B for a highly conserved region in the coiled-coil domain of ACBD3. While picornaviral 3A proteins bind to the C-terminal GOLD domain on ACBD3, we also find that the enterovirus and kobuvirus 3A proteins interact with ACBD3 in a functionally distinct manner based on differential displacement of TBC1D22A/B, isolation of an ACBD3 mutant that displays differential binding between the 3A proteins, and different ACBD3 binding sites on the 3A proteins.

RESULTS

AP-MS of Strep-tagged ACBD3 reveals interaction with TBC1D22A/B.

Based on its identification as a specific protein interaction partner for picornavirus 3A proteins, the multifunctional protein ACBD3 was hypothesized to be used by 3A as an organizing-scaffold protein at the Golgi interface. To identify potential novel interactions of ACBD3 relevant to the 3A system in host cells, we transiently overexpressed and affinity purified N- and C-terminally StrepII-tagged ACBD3 in 293T cells and identified interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (

Table 1

; see also

Tables S1, Tab SI.3A and SI.4

in the supplemental material). Nonspecific interacting proteins were defined as the highest-frequency proteins identified in a background model of 550 AP-MS data sets compiled from the structural and nonstructural genes from 12 different picornaviruses, excluding the 3A protein itself (see

Table S1, Tab SI.1

).

Interacting proteins identified by AP-MS for ACBD3, TBC1D22A, TBC1D22B, and PI4KIIIb were weighted by

Z

score of the peptide counts. Proteins are listed here with replicate

Z

scores and peptide counts in the experimental set with a minimum of

n

= 5 biological replicates and were scored against a background set of 550 unrelated picornaviral protein AP-MS experiments, excluding the 3A protein itself (Materials and Methods). Shown here are the top-scoring proteins that appeared in at least two replicate experiments and with >1 count in at least one experiment; a full

Z

score table is provided in

Table S1, Tab SI.4

in the supplemental material. The major interacting proteins for ACBD3 included TBC1D22A and PI4KB, as well as PPM1H, TMEM55B isoform 2, CPVL, and GOLGB1. Reciprocal AP-MS experiments with TBC1D22A, its closely related isoform TBC1D22B, and PI4KB confirmed interaction with ACBD3. Proteins are C-terminally StrepII-tagged (CS) unless otherwise noted as N-terminally tagged (NS).

Using this AP-MS approach combined with

Z

score ranking for interaction specificity, we found that ACBD3 interacted with the TBC1 domain family member 22A protein (TBC1D22A) in a highly specific manner and at levels that were comparable to those of PI4KB (

Table 1

; full

Z

scores are provided in

Table S1, Tab SI.4

in the supplemental material). Additional proteins such as transmembrane protein 55B isoform 2 (TMEM55B) and protein phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) were also observed to be specific for ACBD3. The known ACBD3-interacting Golgi protein giantin/GOLGB1 was identified in affinity purifications of N-terminally tagged ACBD3 only in a buffer that included potassium chloride and divalent cations (

Table 1

) (7).

TBC1D22A is a 58-kDa protein that is localized to the Golgi apparatus and involved in Golgi membrane maintenance, along with its closely related isoform TBC1D22B (

10

). Both contain a C-terminal TBC domain that is responsible for Rab GTPase activation with a putative preference for Rab33A/B (

9

). Overexpression of TBC1D22B was shown to cause disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), which was dependent on its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity (

10

). Based on the localization of ACBD3 and picornavirus replication to ERGIC-associated membranes, TBC1D22A/B merited further investigation.

Affinity purification of TBC1D22A/B or PI4KB captures ACBD3 and 14-3-3 proteins.

To confirm the ACBD3-TBC1D22A interaction, reciprocal affinity purification was undertaken with N- and C-terminally Strep-tagged TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B (see

Table S1, Tab SI.3A and SI.3B

in the supplemental material). The top-ranking interacting protein for both TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B was ACBD3 (

Table 1

). Multiple 14-3-3 isoforms were also found in high abundance in affinity purifications for both TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B (see

Table S1, Tab SI.5

). 14-3-3 proteins are 27-kDa adaptor proteins that bind phosphoserine residues on a multitude of cellular proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways (

11

). TBC1D22A/B phosphopeptides are reported in

Table S1, Tab SI.6

and include a putative 14-3-3 recognition site at serine 167 (TBC1D22A) or serine 154 (TBC1D22B; spectra are provided in

Fig. S1

). No peptides for PI4KB were recovered in any AP-MS experiments on TBC1D22A or TBC1D22B, suggesting that ACBD3-TBC122A/B-containing complexes do not contain PI4KB.

To further confirm the PI4KB-ACBD3 interaction, affinity purification of Strep-tagged PI4KB was performed. The top-ranking protein was ACBD3, while a 14-3-3 isoform was ranked third (

Table 1

; see also

Table S1, Tab SI.3D

in the supplemental material). The 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to bind PRKD1-phosphorylated serine 294 of PI4KB and influence its catalytic activity (

12

). This phosphorylated site and others were identified in our affinity purifications as well, as reported in

Table S1, Tab SI.6

(spectrum is provided in

Fig. S1

). Several additional proteins of unknown significance (C10orf76, GBA, and MTA2) discovered in a recent Flag tag AP-MS experiment on PI4KB also ranked highly in our screen (

13

). Finally, as in the reciprocal case above, no peptides for TBC1D22A or TBC1D22B were recovered in any AP-MS experiments on PI4KB.

ACBD3-TBC1D22A/B interaction maps to coiled-coil region and overlaps with PI4KB-interacting region of ACBD3.

To further query the hypothesis that TBC1D22A/B binding and PI4KB binding may represent distinct, potentially competitive binding states of ACBD3, a mammalian two-hybrid reporter assay was used to map the sites of interaction on ACBD3 by deletion mutagenesis (

Fig. 1

). N-terminal truncations of the acyl-CoA binding domain, C-terminal truncations of the GOLD domain, and alanine scanning through the entirety of the CAR domain did not affect ACBD3 binding to TBC1D22A/B, while deletions and point mutations located in the conserved glutamine-rich coiled-coil region between residues 246 and 321 significantly reduced TBC1D22A/B binding (see

Fig. S2 and S3

in the supplemental material; also

Fig. 1

). This region has previously been implicated in binding PI4KB (

6

). Mapping of PI4KB on ACBD3 revealed significant overlap with the region bound by TBC1D22A/B (

Fig. 1A

). Three mutants with mutations in the glutamine-rich region (VQF255AAA, PGN267AAA, and EQHY281AAAA) significantly reduced ACBD3 binding to both PI4KB and TBC1D22A/B (

Fig. 1B

; see also

Fig. S2B

). However, we could isolate no mutant of ACBD3 that retained wild-type levels of PI4KB binding while disrupting TBC1D22A/B binding, or vice versa, including mutation of a recovered phosphorylation site, SS344 (see

Table S1, Tab SI.6

). Two single point mutants in the glutamine-rich region (F258A and Y285A) did demonstrate a significant difference in PI4KB binding versus TBC1D22B and merit further investigation (

Fig. S3

). Although we have mapped the critical binding region of TBC1D22A/B to the Q-rich region of ACBD3, we cannot discount the role of the GOLD domain, as it appears to have an influence on the binding of these proteins as shown in

Fig. 1A

. We also note that TBC1D22A/B was not detected in any PI4KB AP-MS experiment nor was PI4KB detected in any TBC1D22A/B AP-MS experiment (see

Table S1, Tab SI.3B–SI.3D

). Together, these data support the notion that PI4KB and TBC1D22A/B participate in a mutually exclusive relationship with ACBD3.

FIG 1

TBC1D22A/B interaction on ACBD3 is localized to the coiled-coil region and overlaps the PI4KB-interacting region. (A) Mapping of TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB binding localizes to the glutamine-rich (Q) region on ACBD3 by mammalian two-hybrid screening. The three proteins demonstrate similar binding values for all of the mutants tested, with a slight preference of TBC1D22A over TBC1D22B and PI4KB. (B) Alanine mutants across the C-terminal half of ACBD3 demonstrate that TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB binding to ACBD3 is disrupted only by mutations in the glutamine-rich region and not by mutations in the C-terminal GOLD domain. Binding values for the protein-protein interaction reporter (firefly luciferase) are plotted as a percentage of the transfection control values (

Renilla

luciferase). The graphical representation of each construct is colored based on the binding value. Low binding is depicted in black while high binding is depicted in red. The critical region defined by the collection of constructs is demarcated by the yellow box with the dashed outline (ACBD, acyl-CoA binding domain; CAR, charged amino acid region; Q, glutamine-rich region; GOLD, Golgi dynamics domain).

The N terminus of TBC1D22A/B is required for ACBD3 interaction.

To understand whether the RabGAP domain or some other region of TBC1D22A/B was responsible for the interaction with ACBD3, both mammalian two-hybrid mapping and AP-Western blotting were performed on deletion mutants of TBC1D22A/B. By both of these methods, the ACBD3-interacting region was localized to a predicted alpha-helix between residues 90 and 105 of TBC1D22A, demonstrating that the TBC domain was not required for binding (

Fig. 2A

; see also

Fig. S4A

in the supplemental material). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed a valine-leucine residue pair that was required for ACBD3 binding along with a minor involvement of residues VVME93 (

Fig. 2B

; see also

Fig. S4B

).

FIG 2

ACBD3 interaction localizes to the N terminus on TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B and is disrupted by the same valine-leucine mutation. (A) Deletion mutagenesis of TBC1D22A specifically localizes its interaction with ACBD3 by mammalian 2-hybrid screening to a predicted N-terminal helix near residues 90 to 105. (B) Alanine scanning reveals a critical dependence on residues VL101 with a contribution from VVME93. (C) Deletion mutagenesis of TBC1D22B also localizes its interaction with ACBD3 to a predicted N-terminal helix, as in TBC1D22A, despite an amino acid identity of <40% outside the RabGAP domain. (D) Alanine scanning across the TBC1D22B helix demonstrates that the ACBD3 interaction is significantly disrupted by the VL100AA mutation, as well as a contribution from upstream residues LNS88.

TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B share 78% amino acid identity in their respective RabGAP domains yet share <40% amino acid identity outside the RabGAP domain. Deletion mapping of TBC1D22B similarly localized the ACBD3 interaction to a predicted alpha-helix with conserved sequence to TBC1D22A, including the valine-leucine pair (

Fig. 2C

; see also

Fig. S4C

in the supplemental material). Alanine scanning of this region on TBC1D22B also revealed substantial defects (≥100-fold decrease) in binding, especially at VL100 (

Fig. 2D

). Mutation of phosphorylation sites on TBC1D22B discovered by mass spectrometry, all of which reside outside the identified interacting region, to glutamic acid as a phosphomimetic did not affect binding to ACBD3 (see

Fig. S4D

and

Table S1, Tab SI.6

). Mammalian two-hybrid mapping on TBC1D22A/B was confirmed by AP-Western blotting and AP-MS (see

Fig. S4A to C

). Interestingly, six total AP-MS experiments with full-length TBC1D22A and TBC1D22B and deletion mutants of TBC1D22A, all of which retained ACBD3 binding, showed that they copurified with ARFGEF1, a trans-Golgi membrane-localized Sec7 domain containing the guanine exchange factor for Arf1 (

14

). This interaction is highly specific, as peptides to ARFGEF1 were detected in only those six deletion and full-length TBC1D22A/B AP-MS experiments out of a total of >2,100 AP-MS runs in our lab (spectra are provided in

Fig. S1

).

Deletion mapping, alanine mutagenesis, and AP-Western blotting of TBC1D22A revealed a significant involvement of serines 165 and 167 for 14-3-3 protein recruitment. This site matches the canonical type I 14-3-3 binding motif of R-[SFYW]-X-pS-X-P, suggesting that serine 167 is the phosphorylated serine responsible for 14-3-3 recruitment (

15

). TBC1D22A deletion and point mutants that disrupted 14-3-3 binding retained the ability to bind ACBD3, while the TBC1D22A VL101AA mutant that disrupted ACBD3 interaction was still able to bind 14-3-3 isoforms, similarly to wild-type TBC1D22A (

Fig. 2A

; see also

Fig. S4B

in the supplemental material). While the significance of TBC1D22A interaction with 14-3-3 proteins remains unknown, these data suggest that TBC1D22A interaction with ACBD3 is not mediated by 14-3-3 isoforms or vice versa.

PI4KB-ACBD3 interaction maps to the N terminus of PI4KB.

We employed both AP-Western blotting and mammalian two-hybrid mapping in conjunction with deletion mutants to localize the region of PI4KB required for interaction with ACBD3 (

Fig. 3

). By N-terminal and C-terminal deletion, a region of 19 amino acids, extending from residues 53 to 70, of PI4KB was necessary for interaction with ACBD3 by both assays, indicating that the catalytic domain, the lipid kinase unique (LKU) region, and the Hom2 region of PI4KB were dispensable (

16

) (

Fig. 3A

; see also

Fig. S5A, B

, and C in the supplemental material). Analogously to what was found in TBC1D22A/B, alanine scanning of this narrow region in PI4KB revealed that a valine-leucine pair (VL67) was required for ACBD3 interaction with additional contribution from upstream residues (

Fig. 3B

), suggesting that these two proteins bind ACBD3 via similar motifs. These results were also confirmed by AP-Western blotting (see

Fig. S5A to C

). Two mutants, VL67 and IDP55, that retained the ability to bind alternative PI4KB partners, C10orf76 and Rab11B, were identified, suggesting that the ACBD3 binding deficit was specific (

Fig. 3B

). We note that the QE65AA mutant demonstrated no ability to bind C10orf76 or Rab11B but bound to ACBD3 at levels 6-fold greater than those for the wild type according to the mammalian two-hybrid reporter (

Fig. 3B

), although it is not necessarily clear whether these differences in binding are due to increased binding to one factor or to an inability to bind another competing factor. Finally, mutation of PI4KB phosphorylation sites discovered by mass spectrometry, all of which reside outside the critical interaction region, to glutamic acid did not affect binding to ACBD3, C10orf76, or Rab11B (see

Fig. S5D

).

FIG 3

ACBD3 interaction localizes to the N terminus on PI4KB and is disrupted by the same valine-leucine mutation. (A) Deletion mapping of PI4KB localizes its interaction with ACBD3 to the far N terminus on PI4KB by mammalian 2-hybrid screening. (B) Alanine scanning of the putative alpha-helix on PI4KB demonstrated a significant contribution of residues VL67 and IDP55 to its interaction with ACBD3. Binding of PI4KB interactors Rab11B and C10orf76 was used to control for global protein defects. Mutant QE65AA abrogated binding of PI4KB to C10orf76 and Rab11B but increased binding to ACBD3 by 6-fold.

TBC1D22A/B competes with PI4KB for ACBD3 binding

in vitro.

The combined AP-MS and fine-scale mapping data for TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB suggest a mutually exclusive binding relationship with ACBD3. If this were the case, we would expect there to be a competitive binding relationship between these two proteins and ACBD3. To qualitatively test this hypothesis in a competition ex-periment, increasing amounts of pro-tein lysate from 293T cells expressing TBC1D22A-Flag were added to premixed 293 lysate from PI4KB-V5- and ACBD3-Strep-expressing cells (

Fig. 4A

). Affinity purification of ACBD3-Strep revealed decreasing amounts of copurified PI4KB-V5 as a function of increasing amounts of TBC1D22A-Flag (

Fig. 4B

). This competition was independent of RabGAP activity, as only the N terminus of TBC1D22A was required (

Fig. 4C

). 293T cell lysate that did not express TBC1D22A-Flag could not compete off PI4KB-V5 (

Fig. 4D

).

FIG 4

The N terminus of TBC1D22A can compete with PI4KB for binding of ACBD3. (A) Experimental setup to test for binding competition. V5-tagged PI4KB expressing 293T lysate was premixed with Strep-tagged ACBD3 expressing 293T lysate and divided seven ways. Increasing amounts of Flag-tagged TBC1D22A expressing 293T lysate were added to each tube, and lysates were affinity purified for Strep-tagged ACBD3 and assayed by Western blotting with anti-V5, anti-Strep, and anti-Flag antibodies. (B) Addition of increasing amounts of full-length TBC1D22A-Flag reduces the amount of PI4KB-V5 bound by ACBD3-Strep. (C) A Flag-tagged N-terminal fragment (1 to 128) of TBC1D22A is sufficient to compete off PI4KB-V5 from ACBD3-Strep. (D) Untransfected lysate is unable to compete PI4KB-V5 from ACBD3-Strep.

3A binding region of ACBD3 localizes to the GOLD domain and associates with ACBD3 self-binding.

Previously, we and others demonstrated that enteroviral and kobuviral 3A proteins interact with ACBD3 by AP-MS and AP-Western blotting (

5

,

6

). To test whether other picornavirus 3A proteins bound ACBD3 more transiently, we tested hepatovirus, klassevirus, parechovirus, cardiovirus, and aphthovirus 3A proteins in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. In this assay, both kobuvirus and enterovirus 3A proteins bound most strongly to ACBD3 while the 3A proteins of hepatovirus, klassevirus, and parechovirus all demonstrated a significant but lesser (approximately 10-fold) ability to bind ACBD3 (

Fig. 5A

). Cardiovirus and aphthovirus 3A proteins did not demonstrate binding to ACBD3 above background.

FIG 5

Picornaviral 3A proteins interact with the GOLD domain of ACBD3 and demonstrate that the far C terminus is critical for ACBD3 self-binding. (A) Picornavirus 3A proteins were tested for their ability to bind ACBD3 by mammalian two-hybrid screening. In addition to kobuvirus and enterovirus, 3A proteins from hepatitis A virus, klassevirus, and human parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) demonstrated an intermediate affinity for ACBD3. Cardiovirus and aphthovirus showed no ability to bind ACBD3 above background. CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; TMGDVII, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (strain GDVII); FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus. (B) Poliovirus and Aichi virus 3A proteins interact with the C-terminal GOLD domain of ACBD3. (C) Mutations in the GOLD domain disrupt picornavirus 3A binding and ACBD3 self-binding. One ACBD3 mutant (SYS511AAA) demonstrated a subtle ability to distinguish between poliovirus and Aichi virus 3A proteins. (D) Picornavirus 3A proteins and ACBD3 demonstrate a critical dependence on the presence of residue 525 for binding to ACBD3.

Aichi virus 3A interaction with ACBD3 was previously mapped to the GOLD domain of ACBD3 (

6

). Given the broad range of picornavirus 3A proteins interacting with ACBD3, we used the mammalian two-hybrid reporter system to investigate whether these 3A proteins also interacted with the C-terminal GOLD domain. Both poliovirus and Aichi virus 3A proteins mapped to the C-terminal half of ACBD3 (

Fig. 5B

), consistent with deletion mapping by AP-Western blotting. To further refine the deletion mapping, we found that alanine mutations in the coiled-coil region of ACBD3 that did not bind TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB (VQF255AAA and EQHY281AAAA) retained picornavirus 3A binding. However, all alanine mutations in the GOLD domain disrupted binding of both picornaviral 3A proteins (

Fig. 5C

). One mutation near the C terminus (SYS511AAA or Y512A) demonstrated a slight difference in preference of poliovirus 3A over Aichi virus 3A, suggesting that the binding between the two proteins may be only subtly different (

Fig. 5C

; see also

Fig. S3B

in the supplemental material).

Fine-scale mapping indicated that binding of the 3A proteins was critically dependent on the presence of Tyr residue 525, only three amino acids from the C-terminus of wild-type ACBD3 (

Fig. 5D

). Mapping of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and klassevirus 3A interactions with ACBD3 revealed an interaction profile similar to those of Aichi virus and poliovirus 3A (see

Fig. S6

in the supplemental material), suggesting that these diverse picornaviruses bind ACBD3 in an analogous manner despite their wide sequence divergence (

17

–

19

).

The critical dependence of multiple GOLD domain-interacting proteins on the presence of Tyr-525 for binding to ACBD3 suggested that a potential intramolecular ACBD3 interaction was required. We tested whether ACBD3 could bind itself in the context of the mammalian two-hybrid assay. ACBD3 demonstrated an interaction with itself that mapped to GOLD domain as well as the threshold effect at Tyr-525 (

Fig. 5B to D

). Mutations in GOLD domain that disrupted interaction with ACBD3-interacting partners similarly disrupted ACBD3 homomerization. However, one mutant (SYL414AAA) specifically disrupted ACBD3 homomerization while only slightly decreasing binding to poliovirus 3A and Aichi virus 3A, demonstrating that 3A binding to ACBD3 is not dependent on ACBD3 homomerization, at least for these viral species, as klassevirus 3A and hepatitis A virus 3A did not bind the ACBD3 SYL414AAA mutant above background (see

Fig. S6B

in the supplemental material). While these results are suggestive of a possible interplay between ACBD3 homomerization and binding by viral 3A proteins, additional biochemical characterization will be required to explore this dynamic.

ACBD3 binding regions on picornavirus 3A are distinct.

To further investigate the possibility of differential ACBD3 interactions with Aichi virus and poliovirus 3A proteins, we extended our deletion and mammalian two-hybrid mapping of the ACBD3-interacting region for both of these proteins. Deletion of the C-terminal half of poliovirus 3A reduced ACBD3 binding by 100-fold, while a comparable deletion in Aichi virus 3A retained ACBD3 binding (

Fig. 6A and B

), consistent with previous results in which alanine scanning the entirety of Aichi virus 3A revealed only two point mutations that affected ACBD3 binding (

5

). N-terminal deletions in the GBF1 binding domain of poliovirus 3A significantly increased ACBD3 binding relative to that of the wild type by more than 10-fold (

Fig. 6A

). Alanine scanning of much of the N-terminal half of poliovirus 3A revealed several point mutants C terminal to the GBF1 binding site that were critical for binding ACBD3 by AP-Western blotting (D29A, R34A, KKGW42-KGA, and R54A) (see

Fig. S9C

in the supplemental material). These results implicate multiple portions of Aichi virus 3A for binding to ACBD3, while poliovirus 3A appears to contain a defined ACBD3 binding domain that is C-terminal to its GBF1 binding region and dimerization region (

20

).

Mapping of poliovirus and Aichi virus 3A interaction with ACBD3 reveals differences in 3A-ACBD3 interaction architecture. (A) Deletions of poliovirus 3A illustrate that a region C terminal to the GBF1 binding region and N terminal of the predicted transmembrane region is required for binding ACBD3. (B) Deletions of Aichi virus 3A reveal the presence of multiple ACBD3 binding regions across the 3A protein, with the bulk of ACBD3 binding mapping to the N-terminal half of Aichi virus 3A.

Kobuviral 3A proteins prevent TBC1D22A binding to ACBD3, while enterovirus 3A proteins do not.

Given that TBC1D22A/B appears to compete with PI4KB for ACBD3 binding and that picornaviruses are dependent on PI4KB for activity, we hypothesized that picornavirus 3A interaction with ACBD3 could influence the outcome of this competition. We note that in the picornavirus 3A AP-MS data that we have published previously (

5

), peptides to TBC1D22A/B were recovered in multiple enteroviral 3A AP-MS experiments while no peptides to TBC1D22A/B were ever identified in kobuviral 3A AP-MS experiments where a stable ACBD3-PI4KB complex was identified (see

Table S1, Tab SI.4

in the supplemental material) (5). To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the presence of different 3A proteins affected the TBC1D22A-ACBD3 interaction. We coexpressed kobuvirus 3A and enterovirus 3A proteins together with TBC1D22A and then assayed affinity-purified TBC1D22A by Western blotting. Whereas the expression of enterovirus 3A proteins did not affect the recovery of affinity-purified TBC1D22A, we observed an apparent affect on the expression of TBC1D22A in the presence of kobuvirus 3A (see

Fig. S7

).

We investigated whether the presence of Aichi virus 3A or poliovirus 3A could affect the endogenous level of TBC1D22A mRNA. Using HEK293T cells transfected with Aichi virus 3A-Flag or poliovirus 3A-Flag, we measured the level of TBC1D22A mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). There was no significant difference in the level of TBC1D22A mRNA in the presence of poliovirus 3A and only modest changes (<14%) in the presence of TBC1D22A (see

Fig. S8

in the supplemental material).

To investigate the effect of picornavirus 3A protein interaction with respect to PI4KB and TBC1D22A interaction with ACBD3, and to avoid the apparent effect of coexpression differences in the presence of 3A proteins, we separated the expression of the proteins by independently transfecting Flag-tagged picornavirus 3A proteins and TBC1D22A-V5 into different plates of HEK293T cells. We then immunoprecipitated TBC1D22A-V5 complexes onto beads and added exogenous HEK293T lysates containing overexpressed poliovirus 3A-Flag and Aichi virus 3A-Flag. Finally, the TBC1D22A-V5 beads were recovered and assayed for ACBD3 and 3A-Flag recruitment by Western blotting (

Fig. 7A

). Poliovirus 3A-Flag could be readily detected in TBC1D22A-ACBD3-containing complexes, while Aichi virus 3A-Flag could not (

Fig. 7B

). Quantification of this difference demonstrated a >7-fold increase in poliovirus 3A recovery from the TBC1D22A-V5 beads over that of Aichi virus 3A (

Fig. 7C

). Collectively, these results support a model whereby the kobuviral and enteroviral 3A proteins may differentially modulate the interaction of PI4KB and TBC1D22A/B with ACBD3.

(A) Experimental setup to test the influence of 3A proteins on the interaction of TBC1D22A with ACBD3. V5-tagged TBC1D22A, Flag-tagged Aichi virus 3A, and Flag-tagged poliovirus 3A were each singly transfected into a 15-cm plate of HEK293T cells. TBC1D22A-V5 was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 beads, washed 4 times, and left on the bead, to which Flag-tagged picornaviral 3A protein lysate was added and left to incubate overnight at 4°C. This lysate was again centrifuged with the anti-V5 beads and washed 4 times, and then captured proteins were boiled off the beads in SDS sample buffer to examine whether 3A-Flag could occupy the same ACBD3 as TBC1D22A by Western blotting. (B) Flag-tagged Aichi virus 3A does not copurify with TBC1D22A-V5 and bound ACBD3, while Flag-tagged poliovirus 3A copurifies with TBC1D22A-V5 and its captured ACBD3 by Western blotting. (C) Quantification of bound poliovirus 3A-Flag relative to Aichi virus-Flag, adjusted for the amount of ACBD3 pulled down, reveals a 7-fold difference in binding.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we have identified TBC1D22A/B as a new interacting partner of ACBD3, a protein of central importance in Golgi organization and picornaviral replication. TBC1D22A/B is a Golgi membrane-localized putative Rab33 RabGAP (

9

). Altered ER-Golgi morphology has been associated with overexpression of TBC1D22B and is dependent on the presence of TBC1D22B RabGAP activity (

10

). We found that the interaction between TBC1D22A/B and ACBD3 was dependent on a narrow region that maps to a predicted helix in the N terminus of TBC1D22A/B. This interaction may determine localization of these RabGAPs to the Golgi membrane and their ability to affect Golgi morphology. TBC1D22A/B bound to the same region on ACBD3 as did PI4KB, and we found that the same residues that were critical for TBC1D22A/B binding were also critical for PI4KB binding. Together with our finding that TBC1D22A/B directly competed with PI4KB for ACBD3 binding, this suggests that, in addition to putatively regulating Rab33 GTP binding at the Golgi membrane, these RabGAPs may in part determine the Golgi membrane localization of PI4KB, thereby influencing cellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels and Golgi morphology. It is also of note that other RNA viruses and intracellular pathogens use TBC domain-containing proteins and their binding partners to manipulate Rab dynamics at the ER-Golgi interface for their replication, including hepatitis C virus,

Legionella

and

Shigella

species, and pathogenic

Escherichia coli

(

).

Given that both TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB share very similar binding sequences and that no ACBD3 mutant could be found that discriminates between these two partners, it remains an open question whether direct regulation of either of these proteins produces modified binding to ACBD3. Mutation of the main phosphorylation site on ACBD3 (SS344) to alanine or glutamic acid had no differential effect on TBC1D22A/B versus PI4KB binding. Conversion of the identified phosphorylation sites on TBC1D22B and PI4KB to glutamic acid also did not disrupt interaction with ACBD3. TBC1D22A/B and PI4KB are organized in similar fashions, with an N-terminal ACBD3 binding domain, a 14-3-3 binding phosphorylation site in the middle, and a C-terminal enzymatic domain. Because 14-3-3 does not bind to phosphomimetic mutations, we were unable to test the effect of 14-3-3 binding on interaction with ACBD3 without phosphorylation (

15

). At present, in the absence of three-dimensional structure information for each of these proteins, it is not clear what regulates the binding of TBC1D22A/B versus PI4KB to the glutamine-rich region of ACBD3.

The picornaviral 3A proteins may inform the cellular biology that regulates whether TBC1D22A/B or PI4KB is bound to ACBD3. An open question in picornavirus biology is why enteroviruses retain a specific GBF1 recruitment domain and are sensitive to brefeldin A while kobuviruses do not bind GBF1 and are insensitive to brefeldin A. Given that multiple picornaviruses rely on ACBD3 and PI4KB, direct competition by TBC1D22A/B suggests that viruses have evolved a mechanism to subvert cellular regulation of these two proteins. Our data show that the kobuviral 3A proteins appear to abrogate the binding of TBC1D22A/B to ACBD3, thus favoring the formation of a stable 3A-ACBD3-PI4KB complex that remains even after 25 to 30 min of washing. This stable complex may obviate the need for GBF1 recruitment and activity and allow kobuviruses to directly influence PI4KB localization and activity with respect to viral replication in a manner similar to, yet distinct from, that of enterovirus 3A. It is also remarkable that a protein that binds entirely to the GOLD domain can manipulate the binding of proteins in other domains of ACBD3, suggesting cross talk between ACBD3’s various domains. Although we have mapped the critical binding region of TBC1D22A/B to the Q-rich region of ACBD3, we cannot discount the role of the GOLD domain, as it appears to have an influence on the binding of these proteins as shown in

Fig. 1A

.

It is not clear if or how enteroviruses manipulate the TBC1D22A/B-ACBD3 interaction, given that enterovirus 3A and TBC1D22A/B appear to occupy the same ACBD3 in our affinity purifications. The ACBD3-PI4KB-TBC1D22A/B system may provide a clue as to why enterovirus 3A proteins directly bind to and require GBF1 for replication. Mapping of the ACBD3-interacting region on the poliovirus 3A protein demonstrated an ACBD3 binding domain C-terminal to the region responsible for binding GBF1, suggesting that poliovirus 3A’s recruitment of GBF1 to Golgi membranes might be for recruitment of GBF1 to ACBD3. GBF1-Arf1 dynamics at the membrane may be responsible for recruiting another regulator that determines whether TBC1D22A/B or PI4KB is bound to ACBD3. Our affinity purification conditions may not promote the formation of a 3A-GBF1-ACBD3-PI4KB complex, thus allowing TBC1D22A/B to compete off PI4KB from ACBD3.

The reliance on overexpressed proteins in these protein-protein interaction studies is an important caveat. For example, nonphysiological levels of ACBD3 and/or TBC1D22A/B could produce an interaction that would be unlikely to occur at native levels. While our attempts to address this have been hampered by the lack of immunoprecipitation-competent antibodies to the untagged version of TBC1D22A/B, we have previously published experiments which indicate that ACBD3 and TBC1D22A/B interact at native expression levels. Specifically, we note that native TBC1D22A/B copurified with native ACBD3 in the presence of affinity-purified enterovirus 3A proteins, suggesting that the interaction is not entirely an artifact of overexpressing ACBD3 or TBC1D22A/B (see Table S7 in reference

5

).

Future experiments with the PI4KB mutants isolated in this study will help illuminate whether different PI4KB mutants can rescue enterovirus replication after depletion of native PI4KB. However, it is of note that enteroviruses selected for resistance to enviroxime family PI4KB inhibitors contain mutations in the ACBD3 binding region of 3A (V45A and H57Y) (

25

). How these mutants affect ACBD3 binding by 3A and whether PI4KB can compete TBC1D22A/B off ACBD3 are important outstanding questions.

In conclusion, multiple picornaviruses coopt the same central ACBD3-PI4KB axis for replication but utilize different cellular mechanisms to manipulate the system. The kobuviruses and enteroviruses may reflect convergent evolutionary strategies to manipulate this key lipid regulator. The mutants obtained in this study will be useful tools to test whether PI4KB localization to ACBD3 is required for picornavirus replication; to test the effect of ACBD3, TBC1D22A/B, and GBF1 on PI4P levels in the cell; and to discover regulatory mechanisms that govern the ACBD3 interactome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells, plasmids, and cloning.

293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-H21 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin. All genes for transient transfections were cloned into a modified pCDNA4-TO vector containing an N-terminal or C-terminal 2× Strep II-tag as described previously using primers from

Table S1

in the supplemental material (26). Accession numbers used for genes were as follows: ACBD3, NM_0022735; PI4KB, NM_002651; TBC1D22A, NM_014346; TBC1D22B, NM_017772; Rab11B. The human C10orf76 gene was synthesized commercially (BioBasic Inc., Canada).

Transient transfections were performed in a 15-cm plate of 293T cells at 50 to 60% confluency using 10 µg of total plasmid and a 3:1 ratio of TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent to plasmid (Mirus Bio). Protein lysates were prepared in 0.5% NP-40 in a background buffer of either 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA or 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mM potassium acetate (KOAc), 2 mM magnesium acetate (MgOAc), 1 mM CaCl

2

, 15% glycerol, 1× Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Affinity purifications and Western blotting assays were otherwise performed as described previously (5, 26).

For the ACBD3 binding competition assay, transient transfections of ACBD3-Strep, TBC1D22A-Flag, and PI4KB-V5 in individual 15-cm plates of 293T cells were performed as described above. Lysates from each plate were prepared in 2 ml of EDTA-containing buffer. PI4KB-V5 and ACBD3-Strep lysate were premixed in a 15-ml Falcon tube for 4 h at 4°C. The lysate was then divided into 7 aliquots of 500 µl each, and 0, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1,000 µl of lysate from the TBC1D22A-Flag-transfected plate or an untransfected plate was added to the aliquots along with 35 µl of StrepTactin resin (IBA Life Sciences) and incubated overnight at 4°C. ACBD3-Strep was affinity purified, and copurified TBC1D22A-Flag and PI4KB-V5 were detected by Western staining using anti-Flag and anti-V5 antibodies (Sigma). For the 3A-TBC1D22A cotransfection experiments (see

Fig. S8

in the supplemental material), 2.5 µg of TBC1D22A-Strep and 7.5 µg of picornavirus 3A-Flag were cotransfected using Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent as described above.

Mammalian two-hybrid screening.

Interaction mapping was performed by mammalian two-hybrid screening using the Checkmate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Bait proteins were cloned into the pAct and pBind plasmids using the KpnI and EcoRV restriction sites and primers as described in

Table S1

in the supplemental material. Thirty-three nanograms each of pAct, pBind, and pG5Luc plasmids was transfected into 15,000 293T cells plated 24 h previously in each well of a 96-well plate. Firefly and

Renilla

luciferase levels were measured using the dual-luciferase assay kit 40 to 48 h after transfection (Promega). The level of binding is expressed as firefly luciferase values as a percentage of transfection control

Renilla

luciferase values, measured on a Veritas microplate luminometer.

qRT-PCR.

For qRT-PCR, 1 µg of Aichi virus 3A-Flag or poliovirus 3A-Flag was transfected into a 6-well plate of HEK293T cells in log phase and harvested 48 h later. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Two micrograms of total RNA from HEK293T cells was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)

20

, and qRT-PCR was performed using the 480 DNA SYBR Green I master mix (Roche) on a LightCycler (Roche). Primers used were the TBC1D22A-CDS4 and hRPL19 set at a melting temperature (

T

m

) of 50°C and with an extension of 1 min at 72°C (see

Table S1

in the supplemental material).

Protein identification by mass spectrometry.

Protein identification from affinity-purified samples was performed using peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry as previously reported (5). Affinity-purified samples were reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and iodoacetamide, respectively, and then subjected to trypsin digestion either in solution or in excised SDS-PAGE gel bands. Peptide sequencing was performed using an LTQ-FT, an LTQ-Orbitrap XL, or an LTQ-Velos (Thermo) mass spectrometer, each equipped with 10,000-psi system nanoACUITY (Waters) ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) instruments for reversed-phase C

18

chromatography and using the same data acquisition and processing methods as those previously reported (5).

Database searches were performed against the

Homo sapiens

plus

Virus

subset of the NCBInr RefSeq database (14 January 2012), to which were added virus clone sequences missing from the public database, totaling 131,457 entries. This database was concatenated with a fully randomized set of 131,457 entries for estimation of the false discovery rate (27). Data were searched with a parent mass tolerance of 20 ppm and fragment mass tolerances of 0.6 Da.

Using peptide counts as an approximation of protein abundance,

Z

scores were calculated to represent prey-bait specificity as reported previously (5).

Z

scores for proteins interacting with individual virus or human bait proteins were calculated using a minimum of five replicate experiments together with a background model of 550 control, nonhuman bait data sets. These nonhuman data sets were compiled from the genes from 12 different picornaviruses, excluding the 3A gene itself (VP0/VP2, VP4, VP1, VP3, L, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3C, and 3D), which serve as an unbiased set of proteins that should be orthogonal to the human protein-protein interactions in this network. The nonspecific interacting proteins most commonly identified in this background set, analogous to “frequent fliers” reported as common contaminants in Flag-AP-MS experiments, are reported in

TBC1D22A/B interaction with ACBD3 is localized to the N-terminus of TBC1D22A/B by AP-Western blotting. Confirmation of the mammalian two-hybrid mapping of TBC1D22A/B-ACBD3 interaction was performed by AP-Western blotting. (A and B) Deletion and point mutants of Strep-tagged TBC1D22A were transfected into HEK293T cells, affinity purified with StrepTactin resin, and blotted with anti-ACBD3, anti-14-3-3, and anti-StrepII antibodies. AP-Western blotting indicated that the binding site of ACBD3 maps to the N terminus of TBC1D22A with significant contribution by the VL101 residues. Because 14-3-3 binding was not amenable to mammalian two-hybrid analysis, mapping of the 14-3-3 binding site on TBC1D22A was performed by AP-Western blotting. Deletion mutants and individual point mutants mapped the 14-3-3 binding site to serines 165 and 167. The canonical 14-3-3 binding site of R-[SFYW]-X-pS-X-P suggests serine 167 as the phosphorylated residue responsible for 14-3-3 recruitment. (C) Deletion mutants of TBC1D22B-Strep were transfected into HEK293T cells, affinity purified, and blotted with anti-ACBD3 and anti-Strep antibodies. AP-Western blotting indicated that the binding site of ACBD3 on TBC1D22B maps to a similar location as that on TBC1D22A. (D) Phosphorylation sites discovered by AP-MS of TBC1D22B were converted to the phosphomimetic amino acid glutamic acid by site-directed mutagenesis, cloned into the pBind plasmid, and tested for binding to ACBD3 in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Where the individual residue that was phosphorylated could not be identified due to runs of serines or threonines, all sites that could be modified were changed to glutamic acid. Phosphomimetic mutations did not affect the binding of TBC1D22B to ACBD3, suggesting that single phosphorylations themselves do not alter the binding to ACBD3. Download

Background

Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly lethal malignancy in women and continues to pose a significant global public health challenge. According to epidemiological data spanning from 1990 to 2019, the worldwide incidence of OC was approximately 294.42 × 10

3

cases, with an associated mortality of about 198.41 × 10

3

cases. Notably, China accounted for around 45.48 × 10

3

incident cases and approximately 29.09 × 10

3

deaths due to this disease during the same period. In the year of analysis (2019), there was an alarming rise in both standardized death rate (2.88 per 100,000) and crude death rate (4.17 per 100,000) attributed to ovarian cancer [

1

,

2

]. The elevated mortality rate of ovarian cancer is linked to its subtle and atypical early symptoms, including abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, early satiety, and changes in bowel function. These manifestations often lead to diagnostic challenges and confusion with other medical conditions [

3

,

4

]. Moreover, the early stages of the disease are characterized by a dearth of efficacious diagnostic methods. Furthermore, as the cancer progresses, malignant cells disseminate via hematogenous and lymphatic routes to various sites within the abdominal cavity including but not limited to the liver, lungs, brain. Consequently, delayed diagnosis significantly compromises prognosis for OC treatment [

4

]. Currently, the management of OC primarily relies on surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical resection aims to maximize tumor tissue removal, however, due to the invasive nature of abdominal and pelvic cavity operations, it poses challenges in terms of difficulty, slow postoperative recovery, and potential complications [

5

,

6

]. Despite the sensitivity of OC to chemotherapy, the majority of patients experience relapse and rapid mortality. The resistance to chemotherapy and the challenges in disease management with current therapeutic approaches contribute to this phenomenon [

4

,

7

].

OC is categorized into three primary types: epithelial, germ cell, and interstitial tumors. Within the epithelial type, there are five subtypes, namely low-grade serous cancer, high-grade serous cancer, endometrioid cancer, clear cell cancer, and mucinous cancer. Notably, high-grade serous ovarian cancer stands out as the most aggressive and deadliest subtype [

4

,

8

]. If ovarian cancer is treated and diagnosed early, the 5-year survival rate ranges from 80 to 90 percent when it remains localized within the ovaries; however, this rate drops to less than 30 percent when there is infiltration of adjacent pelvic structures or distant organ metastasis [

4

,

9

]. Cisplatin exerts a significant impact on the initial treatment of ovarian cancer by inducing cross-linking and RNA destruction, effectively eradicating proliferating cancer cells. Failure to promptly repair damaged DNA triggers the DNA damage response, leading to apoptosis activation [

10

]. However, the majority of patients eventually develop resistance to cisplatin following repeated exposure, thereby resulting in tumor recurrence. The acquisition of cisplatin resistance is an intricate process, involving multiple mechanisms[

11

]. Ziliang Wang and colleagues have shown a noteworthy increase in the expression of fibrillin-1 in ovarian cancer tissues. This upregulation subsequently triggers the downstream pathway through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Ultimately, this leads to altered gene expression related to angiogenesis and glycolysis mediated by transcription factor 2, thereby promoting cisplatin resistance [

12

]. Sipei Nie et al. reported an upregulation of ALKBH5 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian epithelial carcinoma, where it forms a loop with HOXA10 to facilitate the development of cisplatin resistance in cancer cells [

13

]. Chemotherapy resistance constitutes the primary cause of treatment failure in ovarian cancer, necessitating urgent investigation into the underlying mechanisms and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

This study involved a thorough analysis of biological information to identify 132 genes linked to the onset of cisplatin resistance in OC. Subsequently, LASSO regression analysis identified 8 key genes. To validate their expression, clinical samples were collected and analyzed using RT-qPCR and Western Blot techniques. VPS13B, TBC1D22A, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PPP1R15A were identified as poor prognostic genes for cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, while PLGRKT, CDKAL1 and TAP1 were identified as good prognostic genes. These associated prognostic signature genes can potentially facilitate early detection and improved treatment of ovarian cancer, providing novel insights into the clinical diagnosis and management of this disease.

Materials and methods

Data download

The GSE116439 dataset, obtained through the R package GEOquery from the GEO database, encompasses a gene expression profile derived from the NCI-60 cell line exposed to cisplatin, an anticancer drug. We screened 14 samples from GSE116439 for subsequent analysis, comprising of 7 control samples treated with 0 nM cisplatin for a duration of 24 h and 7 experimental samples treated with a concentration of 15000 nM cisplatin for the same time period. The GSE116439 dataset is based on the GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array platform, and the probe annotation of the dataset is conducted using the chip GPL platform file.

We retrieved the gene expression profile data and survival data of ovarian cancer patients from the TCGA database for subsequent bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, we obtained the maf file for mutation analysis and excluded samples with missing survival data in ovarian cancer, resulting in a final dataset comprising 373 tumor tissue samples, no normal tissue samples were available.

Cisplatin drug-related differentially expressed genes

To discern alterations in gene expression subsequent to cisplatin exposure, we conducted a differential analysis using the limma packages, aiming to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and experimental groups. The criteria for selecting DEGs for further exploration were set at |logFC|> 1 and a P-value < 0.05. Genes meeting the criteria of logFC > 1 and

P

-value < 0.05 were categorized as up-regulated, while genes contrary to the criteria were classified as down-regulated. The outcomes of the differential analysis were visually presented through a volcano plot generated with the R package ggplot2, a heatmap created using the R package pheatmap, and a box plot constructed with the R package ggpubr.

Differential gene function and pathway enrichment analysis

GO analysis is a widely employed approach for conducting comprehensive functional enrichment studies, encompassing biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC). KEGG stands as a widely employed repository for the comprehensive storage of genomic data, biological pathways, disease information, and pharmaceutical compounds. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses on DEGs associated with cisplatin were carried out using the R-package clusterProfiler. The selection criteria included a

P

-value < 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR or q value) < 0.05.

GSEA enrichment and GSVA analysis

GSEA evaluates the distribution trend of genes in a pre-defined gene set within a phenotypically ranked gene list to assess their contribution to the phenotype. In this study, differentially expressed genes were divided into high and low phenotype relevance groups. The clusterProfiler package enriched all DEGs in these two groups. GSVA, a non-parametric unsupervised algorithm, was then applied using the R language GSVA (version 1.42.0) package. This transformed gene expression data from a matrix with a single gene as a feature to a matrix with a specific gene set as a feature. Each gene set underwent rank statistics, akin to the K-S test, resulting in an Enrichment Score (ES) matrix. This facilitated GSVA enrichment score determination for each sample and subsequent statistical analysis.

Construct prognosis model based on TCGA data

We identified 132 genes with differential expression between the control and experimental groups, considered potential candidates. To assess their prognostic significance in OC, tumor samples were randomly split into a 3:2 ratio, with three as the training set and two as the validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was applied to the training set to identify genes significantly associated with survival (

P

value < 0.05). A prognostic model was constructed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, incorporating only genes with non-zero regression coefficients. The Risk Score model yielded the risk score for each tumor sample, calculated as follows: Coef (genei) represents LASSO regression coefficient, expression (genei) denotes the gene's expression value, and n is the number of genes in the model.

Evaluation of prognostic models

The R-package survminer's surv_cutpoint function was utilized to determine the optimal cutoff value for distinguishing high and low-risk groups in the training set. Following this, Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis and time-dependent ROC analysis were performed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model.

Build a forecast nomogram

A nomogram, based on multiple regression analysis, utilizes a specific scale to assign scores, representing various variables within the multiple regression model. Ultimately, a total score is computed to predict the probability of event occurrence. We integrated the clinical features of ovarian cancer samples to identify the clinical characteristics significantly associated with survival. Following the Cox regression analysis results, we constructed a nomogram using the R package "rms."

Immunoinfiltration analysis

We utilized the CIBERSORTx online tools (

https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/

) to evaluate immune cell infiltration in TCGA—OV data, obtaining abundance values for 22 distinct subtypes of immune cells. We utilized bar charts to visually represent the proportions of anticipated cells, employed Pearson correlation heat maps to illustrate the interrelationships among immune cells, and employed box plots to examine disparities in immune cell populations between high and low risk cohorts.

Drug sensitivity prediction

Using the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) database, Ridge regression was applied to estimate the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) for each patient, and the prediction accuracy was evaluated through tenfold cross-validation. Significance in drug sensitivity differences between high and low-risk groups was determined by comparing

P

values, where

P

< 0.001 was considered statistically significant.

Mutation analysis

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) quantifies the number of somatic nonsynonymous mutations in a specific genomic region. It typically represents the cumulative count of coding errors, base substitutions, and gene insertion or deletion errors detected per million bases. We employed Maftools (version 2.10.0), an R package specifically designed for TMB analysis. This allowed us to quantify somatic non-synonymous point mutations in each sample and assess the mutation frequency of genes in both high-risk and low-risk groups. Furthermore, we visually depicted these findings using an oncoplot waterfall plot.

Chromosome localization analysis of prognostic genes

We will prepare the chromosome localization data, load the RCircos package in the R language environment, and import the data. Subsequently, we will utilize the functions within the RCircos package to generate a circular chromosome map and incorporate chromosomal location markers. The objective of interpreting the results of chromosome localization analysis is to discuss the distribution pattern of prognostic genes on chromosomes and explore the biological significance of these genes.

ceRNA network analysis

The interacting microRNAs associated with genes significantly linked to prognosis were queried in the miRDB database (

http://www.mirdb.org/

), utilizing a Target Score > 88 as a filter. Subsequently, a query was performed in the starBase database to identify interactions of miRNAs (

http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/index.php

). The intersection of these two database queries identified gene-miRNA interactions that were strongly associated with prognostic outcomes. The starBase database was queried to identify lncRNAs that interact with the aforementioned miRNAs, using a filtering condition of clipExpNum > 10. Finally, the ceRNA network diagram was constructed using Cytoscape based on the aforementioned query results.

Quantitative real-time PCR

RNA extraction from tissues was performed using Trizol reagent, reverse transcribed into cDNA utilizing SweScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit, and subsequently amplified with appropriate primers (refer to Table S

1

) for validation of prognostic gene expression in the cisplatin-resistant group of ovarian cancer.

Western Blot

Tissues were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. The protein was then separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Subsequently, the expression of the target protein was detected using the FUSION FX5 imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following continuous incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies targeting the following proteins were used VPS13B (Abcam, ab139814, 1:1000), PLGRKT (Abcam, ab169531, 1:1000), CDKAL1 (Abcam, ab237525, 1:1000), TBC1D22A (Abcam, ab234723, 1:1000), TAP1 (Abcam, ab314745, 1:1000), PPP3CA (Abcam, ab265130, 1:1000), CUX1 (Abclonal, A2213, 1:1000), and PPP1R15A (Abclonal, A16260, 1:1000). The secondary antibody used was β-actin (Abclonal, AC026, 1:10,000).

Statistical analysis

Data processing and analysis in this study used R software (Version 4.1.2), presenting continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation. The Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann–Whitney U test) compared two groups, while the Kruskal–Wallis test assessed three or more groups. Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests determined statistical significance for comparing and analyzing two sets of categorical variables. Unless specified otherwise, Spearman correlation analysis calculated correlation coefficients between different molecules, with a significance threshold at

P

< 0.05.

Results

Analysis of cisplatin drug-related gene differences

The differential gene expression analysis was conducted between the cell samples treated with cisplatin at a concentration of 15000 nM and those untreated for 24 h. A total of 132 genes exhibiting significant differences in expression were identified (Table S

2

), including 35 up-regulated genes and 97 down-regulated genes. Differential gene expression analysis results are illustrated in the volcano plot (Fig.

D). The primary enrichment pathway of differentially expressed genes associated with cisplatin resistance is GO:0062197, which participates in cellular response to chemical stimuli. Additionally, the following gene ontology terms were identified: GO:0006469 (negative regulation of protein kinase activity), GO:0034599 (cellular response to oxidative stress), GO:0005547 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate binding), GO:0005001 (transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity), and GO:0019198 (transmembrane receptor protein phosphatase activity). Furthermore, hsa05169 is linked to Epstein-Barr virus infection, hsa05210 is associated with colorectal cancer, and hsa04110 is involved in cell cycle regulation.

Lastly, the chord diagram's left semicircle denotes genes, and the right semicircle denotes enriched pathways

GSEA and GSVA enrichment analysis

Through GSEA, we obtained insights into the BP, CE, and MF associated with cisplatin resistance-related genes. These genes were found to be significantly enriched in key pathways such as Nod Like Receptor Signaling Pathway, Graft Versus Host Disease, Cytosolic Dna Sensing Pathway, Adherens Junction, Long Term Potentiation, And Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton (Fig.

). The distribution information of the enrichment fraction of cisplatin resistance-related genes obtained through GSVA analysis in each sample was visualized using heat maps. In comparison to the control group, the experimental group exhibited an irregular distribution pattern for the enrichment fraction of cisplatin resistance-related genes (Fig.

A prognostic model of cisplatin resistance related genes was constructed based on TCGA data

In order to assess the prognostic correlation between genes associated with cisplatin resistance and ovarian cancer patients, we utilized TCGA-OV sequencing data and survival information to conduct a survival analysis of tumor samples for cisplatin resistance-related genes. We identified a total of 9 genes with significant prognostic value (

P

< 0.05). (Table S

6

). The LASSO-Cox regression algorithm was employed to establish the prognostic model (Fig.

A, B), resulting in the identification of a risk model comprising eight genes (Table S

7

). Diseased samples were categorized into low and high-risk groups based on the median value of the risk score. The distribution of risk scores and survival status for both the training set (Table S

B) within both high and low-risk groups (

P

< 0.05). The risk scores derived from the prognostic model showed an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.6 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year time points, suggesting a certain level of prognostic value for the model (Fig.

Prognostic analysis based on clinical features

Through univariate Cox regression analysis, we observed significant associations between survival and both risk scores and age (Fig.

6

A). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age and risk scores as independent predictors of overall survival (OS) (Fig.

6

B). Leveraging these factors, we constructed nomograms to evaluate the prognostic power of our model and generated a graphical representation (Fig.

6

C), enabling quantification of individual's survival probabilities at 1, 2, and 3 years. The calibration curve demonstrated excellent concordance between predicted OS and actual observations across all time points (Fig.

Immunoinfiltration analysis

We quantified immune cell abundance in OC samples, obtaining values for 22 different types of immune cells. The correlation between various immune cell types in ovarian cancer samples was visually analyzed through a bubble heat map (Fig.

7

A). This analysis helped us understand the level of correlation between different cell types and comprehend the characteristics of immune infiltration in ovarian cancer samples. For instance, the correlation between T cells CD8 and T cells regulatory Tregs, as well as T cells CD4 memory activated, is notably higher. There is low relevance observed between T cells CD8 and T cells CD4 memory resting. A scatter plot was employed to visually analyze the correlation between the prognostic gene and cell type, revealing a positive association between TAP1 gene expression and invasion degree of Macrophages M1 cell type (Fig.

7

B). Furthermore, a boxplot was utilized to compare immune cell abundance in the high-risk and low-risk groups, demonstrating significant differences in Macrophages M1 cells, CD4 Memory Resting cells, T cells Follicular helper and T cells gamma delta (Fig.

ceRNA network analysis

There are 8 genes associated with prognosis, namely VPS13B, PLGRKT, CDKAL1, TBC1D22A, TAP1, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PPP1R15A. All of these genes are mRNA. A total of 31 microRNAs targeting VPS13B, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PLGRKT genes were screened (Tables S

). Then, we predicted the Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) targeted by these 31 microRNA, and a total of 34 lncRNA were identified (Table S

14

). To visualize the network relationship between prognostic genes, microRNA, and lncRNA, we constructed a ceRNA network diagram (Fig.

Validation of expression of prognostic related genes in ovarian cancer tissues

The expressions of VPS13B, PLGRKT, CDKAL1, TBC1D22A, TAP1, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PPP1R15A in ovarian tissues of patients with OC and cisplatin-resistant OC were detected by QRT-PCR and Western Blot. The expression levels of VPS13B, TBC1D22A, PPP3CA, CUX1, and PPP1R15A genes were found to be up-regulated in ovarian tissue of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer patients compared to those with ovarian cancer. Conversely, the expression levels of PLGRKT, CDKAL1, and TAP1 genes were down-regulated in these patients' ovarian tissue (Fig.

10

A-I). These findings are consistent with the results obtained from bioinformatics analysis.

Discussions

In recent years, there has been gradual advancement in the treatment of ovarian cancer, with surgery combined with chemotherapy emerging as the established standard approach. Early-stage patients can undergo comprehensive surgical intervention, while advanced-stage patients may benefit from tumor cell reduction procedures [

10

]. However, due to the predominance of advanced stage diagnoses for ovarian cancer cases, most patients require chemotherapy as an essential component of their treatment plan. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy stands as the primary therapeutic option for advanced ovarian cancer [

10

,

14

]. However, the majority of patients undergoing chemotherapy eventually develop drug resistance, resulting in tumor recurrence and metastasis [

14

]. Approximately 20% of ovarian cancer patients exhibit inherent resistance to standard first-line platinum drug combination therapy, while platinum-resistant relapse cases account for approximately 25% of all relapse cases observed in clinical practice. Moreover, the prognosis for these cases is exceedingly poor [

15

], highlighting an urgent need for novel intervention targets.

The development of cisplatin resistance in OC chemotherapy encompasses a plethora of molecular alterations, including modifications in drug metabolism, mutations affecting drug targets, perturbations in DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms, initiation of cancer stem cell formation, immunosuppressive effects, deactivation of apoptotic genes, and activation of anti-apoptotic genes [

14

]. Based on multiple datasets obtained from GEO and TCGA databases, this study identified 132 differentially expressed genes related to cisplatin treatment in ovarian cancer cells, with 35 up-regulated and 97 down-regulated genes. The correlation analysis with cisplatin resistance genes identified eight hub genes, namely VPS13B, PLGRKT, CDKAL1, TBC1D22A, TAP1, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PPP1R15A.

Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 Homolog B (VPS13B) is implicated in intracellular transport and subcellular localization, and mutations in this gene result in functional aberrations of the VPS13B protein, potentially impacting the normal functioning of diverse cell types and tissues [

15

]. In a study by Reika Iwakawa et al., frequent mutations and expression of genes were observed in small cell lung cancer including VPS13B [

16

]. In investigations concerning primary invasive breast cancer, aberrant methylation and transcription patterns of VPS13B have been implicated in the promotion of tumor suppressor gene inactivation or oncogene activation [

17

]. The PLGRKT receptor exhibits a distinctive structure and its proteolytic activity plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, encompassing inflammation, tumorigenesis, metastasis, fibrinolysis, cytokine induction, and activity release [

18

]. Plasminogen primarily regulates the inflammatory response by facilitating the recruitment, migration, and aggregation of plasminogen-dependent monocytes and macrophages [

19

]. In recent years, numerous studies have also demonstrated the pivotal role of plasminogen receptors in the regulation of tumor microenvironment. Lindsey A. Miles et al., for the first time, investigated the expression of PLGRKT in human breast cancer, wherein invasive ductal carcinoma exhibited the highest expression level. The phenomenon leads to degradation of fibrin and extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor progression [

20

]. CDKAL1 acts as a tRNA-modified methylthiotransferase, facilitating the production of cytokines that are characteristic of cancer stem cells. Huang et al. have demonstrated the essential role of CDKAL1 in maintaining stem cell-like cytokine profiles across various common cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, liver cancer, stomach cancer and glioma [

21

,

22

]. Moreover, they observed a correlation between elevated expression levels of CDKAL1 and unfavorable prognosis. TBC1D22A is a protein localized in the Golgi apparatus that plays a crucial role in preserving the integrity of the Golgi membrane and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver cancer, epilepsy and other diseases [

23

]. Transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) is a crucial molecule responsible for the processing and presentation of tumor-associated antigens. Aberrant expression of TAP1 has been observed in various tumor types and is known to impact multidrug resistance in human cancer cell lines during chemotherapy [

24

,

25

]. Qianxia Tan et al. discovered that high levels of TAP1 expression serve as an independent prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer patients, correlating with favorable outcomes [

24

,

26

]. The alpha isozyme of protein phosphatase 3, catalytic subunit (PPP3CA) represents as a calmodulin-regulated serine-threonine phosphatase. Variants in PPP3CA have been implicated in the development of early-onset, refractory epilepsy [

23

,

25

,

27

]. Aberrant expression of PPP3CA has also been observed in advanced multiple myeloma (MM), suggesting a potential association between elevated levels of PPP3CA and MM pathogenesis [

28

]. Furthermore, within an immune and iron-death-related risk score model for ovarian cancer patients developed by Chunyan Wei et al., PPP3CA has been identified as a prognostic factor aiding in predicting patient response to immunotherapy [

29

]. These findings align with our study results, emphasizing the significance of PPP3CA as a pivotal prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. CUX1 (CUT-like homeobox 1) is identified as a haploid tumor suppressor associated with both tumor inhibition and progression. [

30

]. Studies have confirmed that the circRNA derived from Cux1, encoding protein P113, drives neuroblastoma (NB) progression by facilitating the trans-activation of ZRF1/BRD4. It exhibits high expression in NB cells and promotes their proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [

31

]. Investigations on pancreatic neurosecretory tumors (pan-NET) have demonstrated that CUX1 serves as a prognostic marker post PanNET surgery and facilitates in vitro tumor progression through enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis [

32

].

Functional analysis using GO and KEGG indicated that these differentially expressed genes are primarily involved in the negative regulation of protein kinase activity, oxidative stress response, chemical cell response. Additionally, they are associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, colorectal cancer, and cell cycle. Meanwhile, GSEA enrichment analysis revealed significant associations of these differential genes with long-term potentiation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, graft-versus-host disease, and cellular DNA sensing pathways.

Furthermore, employing the LASSO-cox regression algorithm, we constructed a risk model comprising 8 differential genes. Survival analysis results demonstrated that the high-risk group exhibited a significantly lower survival rate compared to the low-risk group (

P

< 0.05). Analysis of clinical characteristics identified age and risk score as independent prognostic factors for predicting survival. Further investigation into immune cell abundance disparities between high-risk and low-risk groups was conducted through immunoinfiltration analysis. In the results from these two groups, significant differences were observed in the levels of macrophages, specifically M1, T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells follicular helper, and T cells gamma delta. The expression of TAP1 positively correlates with Macrophages M1 cell type. The findings reveal that in the group exhibiting heightened expression of CA125, a serum tumor marker associated with various cancers including ovarian, endometrial, and bladder cancers, there were elevated levels of M2 macrophage marker, CD163, as well as the regulatory T-cell (Treg) marker, FOXP3, compared to the group with lower CA125 expression. This indicates that individuals with increased CA125 expression in bladder cancer tend to possess a tumor microenvironment characterized by immunosuppression [

33

]. Our results are congruent with this observation, indicating variances in the immune milieu between high-risk and low-risk patients with cancer. Risk prediction models accurately forecast survival outcomes in patients with cisplatin-resistant OC. Through biological information screening, RT-qPCR and WB verification, it was found that VPS13B, TBC1D22A, PPP3CA, CUX1 and PPP1R15A were highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant tissues of ovarian cancer, while PLGRKT, CDKAL1 and TAP1 were low expressed. The conclusion is consistent with the previous conclusions and enriches their research [

23

,

29

].

In this study, we conducted the first screening of differential genes between OC cells and cisplatin-resistant OC cells. However, there are certain limitations in our study. Firstly, the dataset included only 14 patients, which may not provide sufficient evidence to accurately assess the predictive accuracy of the prognostic model. Additionally, our study relies on previous research data; thus, further experimental validation is necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of these genes in the disease and improve their predictive power for clinical applications.

Conclusion

Through bioinformatics analysis of EMS expression profile data, we identified 132 DEGs and 8 prognostic genes. Subsequently, by conducting ceRNA network analysis, VPS13B, TBC1D22A, PPP3CA, CUX1, and PPP1R15A were identified as poor prognostic genes associated with cisplatin resistance in OC. Conversely, PLGRKT, CDKAL1, and TAP1 were found to be good prognostic genes. These findings hold significant implications for the development of novel molecular therapeutic targets and provide a solid theoretical foundation for further investigation into their underlying molecular mechanisms.

#### TBC1D22A - Article 4: A new locus on chromosome 22q13.31 linked to recessive genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) in a Tunisian consanguineous family
<Date>: 2013-9-25

<Full Text Content>:
Background

Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders at worldwide level [

1

]. Environmental and genetic factors are known to play a role in its pathogenesis. Segregation studies suggest that most epileptic syndromes are complex disorders, but several monogenic forms have also been described. Genetic (formerly named generalized [

2

]) epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is such a Mendelian inherited epileptic syndrome. This familial autosomal dominant (AD) epilepsy shows a wide range of phenotypes such as febrile seizures (FS), FS plus (FS+) – defined as FS persisting beyond the age of 6 – as well generalized and partial seizures [

2

,

3

]. In some families, most severe epileptic phenotypes have been described such as the severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or Dravet syndrome [

4

-

6

].

Up to now, eight GEFS+ loci have been registered on OMIM database [

7

-

16

]. Three genes are known to be causative for GEFS+ phenotype:

SCN1B

(MIM#600235;GEFS+1) [

7

],

SCN1A

(MIM#182389; GEFS+2) [

10

] and

GABRG2

(MIM#137164; GEFS+3) [

11

]. Familial forms of pure febrile seizures (FEB) have also been described. Segregation and twin studies of FS suggest a polygenic or multifactorial mode of inheritance [

17

,

18

]. In most FEB families, phenotype follows an AD mode of inheritance [

19

]. To date, according to OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man –

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim

) database, eleven FEB loci have already been reported [

20

-

30

] and only four genes have been linked to FS related phenotypes:

SCN1A

(MIM#182389; FEB3A) [

31

],

MASS1

or

GPR98

(MIM# 602851; FEB4) [

32

],

GABRG2

(MIM#137164; FEB8) [

27

] and

CPA6

(MIM#609562; FEB11) [

30

]. Finally, two other genes are considered as “susceptibility” genes to FEB syndrome and epilepsy:

GABRD

(MIM#137163; GEFS+5) [

15

] and

SCN9A

(MIM#603415; FEB3B/GEFS+7) [

33

].

In the present study, we reported the clinical and genetic studies of a GEFS+ consanguineous Tunisian family with an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance. We used homozygosity mapping, which is a method of choice for localizing genes responsible for AR diseases in consanguineous families [

34

]. This approach allows identifying identical by descent (IBD) regions inherited from a common ancestor. IBD loci are homozygous in all the affected members but not in other relatives. In the present study we report a new locus on chromosome 22q13.31 in which

TBC1D22A

gene (TBC1 domain family, member 22A, also known as

C22orf4

) is located.

Results

Clinical description of consanguineous Tunisian family with GEFS+ patients

The familial pedigree is shown in Figure

1

and main clinical features of affected individuals are described in Table

1

. The occurrence of generalized tonico clonic seizures (GTCS), absence seizure and FS+ led us to consider a GEFS+ syndrome in the present family.

The proband (IV-4) is a 17-year-old boy, born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. At the age of 2, he suffered from a first complex FS. At the age of 6, a febrile GTCS and absence seizures were observed. Due to the continuation of FS, since the age of 5, he has been treated with valproic acid. Neurological examination revealed a mild mental retardation. Standard EEG tracings showed generalized spike waves.

His first cousin, patient IV-3, is an 18-year-old boy, born at term after an uneventful pregnancy, from a consanguineous marriage between first degree cousins. In addition to FS+ which persisted until the age of 13, he experienced, at the age of 3, GTCS. Since the age of 8, absence seizures were also observed. Between the ages of 8 to 12, he was treated with valproic acid. Neurological and EEG exams were normal.

Patient IV-2, first cousin of the two previously described patients, is a 13-year-old girl, born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. She showed FS+ until the age of 10 and she suffered from GTCS since the age of 7. She has been treated by valproic acid since the age of 5. Neurological examination and EEG tracings were normal.

MRI scans were normal in all affected family members.

Genetic linkage and haplotype analysis

We assessed microsatellite markers (Additional file

1

: Table S1) of four GEFS+ loci and seven FEB loci, that were known at that time. Haplotype reconstructions and analysis of recombination events allowed excluding all the GEFS+ and FEB loci analyzed in the present family.

A genome wide genotyping was then performed and parametric linkage using the AR mode of inheritance identified a linked region of 10.6 Mb on chromosome 22q13.31 (Additional file

2

: Figure FS1) flanked by the two SNPs rs3203726 and rs728592 with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.51 (Additional file

1

: Table S5). On the same chromosome, positive LOD scores were also observed at six other loci (Additional file

1

: Table S6). However, haplotype analysis showed that all these loci exhibited only one or two consecutive homozygous SNPs in every affected individual. Consequently, they are less likely to represent the disease locus. Moreover, due to the number of obligate carriers of the disease (8) compared to affected ones (3), the AD model is not likely.

The 10.6 Mb candidate region was further confirmed by using a set of microsatellite markers (Additional file

1

: Table S2). For haplotype reconstructions, we used homozygosity mapping method, which allow localizing homozygous IBD genomic region(s) responsible for AR diseases in consanguineous families. We confirmed the existence of a common homozygous IBD haplotype shared by all the three patients. Therefore, the candidate region was reduced to an interval of 527 kb, flanked by two microsatellite markers, 18GTchr22 and 15ACchr22b. This locus was homozygous in all three affected relatives and heterozygous in other family members (Figure

1

A). Within this homozygous IBD locus lie the 9 last exons and the 3’UTR of

TBC1D22A

which encodes the member 22A of Rab GTPase activator with a TBC1 domain family (Figure

2

). Two polymorphic markers, 17ACchr22 and rs2017931, are also displayed within the IBD interval (Figure

1

A). The most interesting one is the 17ACchr22 microsatellite marker due to its high variability. Its allele 4, corresponding to 16 AC repeats, was found homozygous in all affected relatives and heterozygous in all other unaffected family members. We estimated allele frequencies of 17ACchr22 in a sample of 70 Tunisian controls. Ten alleles (corresponding to 13 to 22 AC repeats) were observed, and the most common alleles were allele 7 (19 repeats) 25%, allele 8 (20 repeats) 22.1%, allele 5 (17 repeats) 17.9%, and allele 6 (18 repeats) 10.7%. Finally, the IBD allele 4, had a frequency of 7.14% and was never found homozygous in the present Tunisian population (Additional file

1

: Table S7).

) with localization of markers within and flanking the 527 Kb IBD linked locus.

Array CGH analysis did not reveal any CNV at the genome-wide level in affected individual IV-3.

Mutational analysis

Mutation analysis was performed by whole-exome sequencing in patient IV-3 where 94.5% of the coding part of the RefSeq genes was covered at least 8×, which was sufficient to detect homozygous substitutions. This experiment revealed only three homozygous non-synonymous putative deleterious variations over the entire genome. Two of them were found on chromosome 22q13.31, within the 10.6 Mb linked region: c.5159C > T (S1720L) in the

TNRC6B

(trinucleotide repeat containing 6B) gene and c.4433C > T (T1478M) (rs8141262) in the

CACNA1I

(alpha 1I subunit of calcium voltage-dependant channel) gene. Genotyping these two missense variations, in all Tunisian family members, was done by HRM assay and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. These analyses showed that they are not linked to the disease phenotype, since the two other affected cousins (IV-2 and IV-4) were heterozygous for both variations. The third variation, found homozygous in patient IV-3, is located on chromosome 1p36.11: c.604T > C (S202P) (rs6687605) in the

LDLRAP1

(low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1) gene. This polymorphism, genotyped by Sanger sequencing (Additional file

1

: Table S3), was also found homozygous in his unaffected cousin IV-1. Therefore, rs6687605 is not linked to GEFS+ phenotype in this family, according to the IBD assumption. Finally, we also performed Sanger sequencing for

KCNJ4

, since this gene codes for a ion channel protein. This family of genes are often found mutated in several epilepsies. Moreover, this gene is located within one of the 6 chromosome 22 short homozygous regions (Additional file

1

: Table S6), which are considered as not linked to the disease (see Genetic linkage and haplotype analysis section). No mutation was observed in this gene.

Discussion

The present study described clinical and molecular investigations on GEFS+ syndrome in a Tunisian consanguineous family. The occurrence of both GTCS and absence in addition to FS+, and in absence of other types of seizures (e.g. myoclonic jerks), led us to consider that GEFS+ phenotype is likely within this family [

2

]. To our knowledge, it would be the first description of a consanguineous GEFS+ Tunisian family with a putative AR mode of inheritance, a transmission previously described in a Moroccan consanguineous family, showing FS and temporal lobe epilepsy phenotypes [

30

]. Moreover, all GEFS+ families, described in OMIM database, exclusively show an AD mode of inheritance [

7

-

16

]. Using homozygous linkage and whole-exome sequencing method, we mapped the pathogenic locus responsible for the disease within a short interval of chromosome 22q13.31 in the present Tunisian consanguineous family.

We first excluded by linkage analysis all known GEFS+ loci at that time, as well as those associated to FS phenotypes. Epileptic syndromes have also been observed in patients with structural variants [

35

,

36

], such as CNVs on chromosome 15q13.3 are known to play an important role in the genetic etiology of idiopathic generalized epilepsy [

37

]. We also excluded such genomic event in this family.

The 22q13.31 region, where we mapped the disease locus, has been implicated in a complex phenotype with epilepsy in 5-year-old boy with a 7.9 Mb

de novo

deletion of chromosome 22q13.2-qter [

38

].

Based on the homozygosity of an IBD locus in patients only, refined mapping allowed reducing the disease locus to the 9 last exons and 3’UTR of

TBC1D22A

, and even to a shorter interval around the exon 12. However no mutation has been observed by whole-exome sequencing in any of these last exons of

TBC1D22A

. Homozygous alleles of the two polymorphic markers (17ACchr22 microsatellite and rs2017931), found in all patients, are likely to be non-functional and probably in linkage disequilibrium with the disease mutation in one of the

TBC1D22A

introns or in 3’UTR. The disease mutation could affect the splicing of

TBC1D22A

. Unfortunately, we were unable to test this hypothesis in absence of available RNA samples from the affected members of the family.

The first crystal structure of TBC1D22A was done in 2008 showing the diversity of human TBC domain family members [

39

]. Very recently, Shapshak et al. found that

TBC1D22A

gene had a differing gene expression profile across patients showing HIV associated dementia [

40

].

TBC1D22A

gene is expressed in brain tissues with a percentage of 2.14% (

http://smd.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/source/sourceSearch

). Moreover, GWAS suggested an association with human longevity and a SNP (rs5766691) located in

TBC1D22A

[

41

], within the 527 kb IBD homozygous interval.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we reported a new locus on chromosome 22q13.31 in a consanguineous Tunisian family with a GEFS+ phenotype with an original AR mode of inheritance. We were not able to identify the disease mutation but restricted the linked interval to a part of

TBC1D22A

, which is expanded from exon 5 to the 3’UTR of the gene. Further studies will confirm whether this gene is also mutated in other families with GEFS+.

This study was approved by the Research and Ethics Review Board of the Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Geneva and by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific and Technological Research of Tunisia.

Methods

Family ascertainment and phenotyping

We recruited a consanguineous Tunisian family extended over four generations, comprising 3 affected and 19 non-affected members, who all originated from Tunis (Tunisia) (Figure

1

). The segregation of the trait suggests an AR mode of inheritance: all the affected relatives are on the last generation and one of them (IV-3) is born from first cousins (III-3 and III-4). The two other affected relatives were born from one parent with the same common ancestors as III-3 and III-4. The two other parents (III-1 and III-6) could descend from a putative common ancestor with their spouses because they all originated from a small village located in the North of Tunisia.

All family members were agree to publish clinical details and they were clinically assessed at Charles Nicolle University Hospital (Tunis) by experienced epileptologists (Hela Khiari-Mrabet and Amel Mrabet). Information on FS and afebrile seizures, age at onset, duration, type and number of seizures, intellectual outcome, antiepileptic drug therapy, and seizures outcome were obtained from their parents and case notes when available. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were done for all affected family members. FS+ phenotype was defined as FS persisting beyond the age of 6 years [

2

]. Generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) and absence seizures were defined according to the criteria established by the “International League against Epilepsy” [

42

-

44

].

Tunisian control group

Seventy unrelated healthy Tunisian controls (mean age 48.5 ± 16.5) were recruited at Charles Nicolle University Hospital (Tunis). These individuals did not have any personal and familial history of seizures.

Genomic DNA

Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives. Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes by phenol/chloroform procedure [

45

].

Exclusion mapping

Linkage analysis with a panel of 36 microsatellite markers spanning the FEB loci (FEB1, FEB2, FEB3, FEB4, FEB5, FEB6 and FEB11/ETL5) and GEFS+ loci (GEFS+1, GEFS+2, GEFS+3 and GEFS+4) known at that time were firstly explored (Table

2

). Primer sequences are listed on Additional file

1

: Table S1 and PCR conditions are available as Additional file

. We excluded all these previously linked loci by linkage analysis.

Genetic linkage and haplotype analysis

A genome-wide linkage study was performed by using the Illumina Gene Chip Linkage Infinium II HumanLinkage-24 Panel Breadchip® (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which allowed us to genotype 5913 SNPs.

Two-point and multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated with MERLIN 1.1 program, assuming an AR inheritance with complete penetrance, a disease allele frequency of 0.00001 and a phenocopy rate of 0. The haplotype reconstruction for family members was done manually, regardless of the individual affection status.

To confirm the region with a LOD score of 2.51 found by linkage analysis and in order to refine the mapping, we chose a set of 8 microsatellite markers located at the chromosome 22q13.31 and distributed at average intervals of 0.2 Mb (Figure

1

B). According to the linked region defined by positive LOD score, we chose some microsatellite repeats using UCSC database (

http://genome.ucsc.edu

) by specifying “microsatellite” in “variations and repeats” part. Primer sequences (Additional file

1

: Table S2) and PCR conditions are available on Additional file

1

.

Genome wide CNVs analysis

We have also performed a copy number variations (CNVs) analysis by using the Agilent Human Genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) Microarray Kit 244 K (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The slide was scanned on an Agilent DNA microarray scanner. Data were obtained by Agilent Feature extraction software 9 and analyzed with Agilent CGH analytics 3.4 software, using the statistical algorithms zscores and ADM-2 with a sensitivity threshold of 2.5 and 6.0, respectively, and a moving average window of 0.2 Mb. Mapping data were analyzed on the human genome sequence using the NCBI database Build 35, Hg17 (

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

).

Candidate gene mutational analysis

Linkage results showed six other loci with positive LOD scores in the vicinity of the 527 kb IBD region. In one of them lies

KCNJ4

, which encodes a potassium inwardly-rectifying channel (subfamily J and member 4). According to its physical position and its functional role, this putative candidate gene for epilepsy, was sequenced in the present consanguineous family. We performed PCR for the two exons and splice junctions. We designed flanking exon primers from published sequences with the Primer3 (version.0.4.0) online program (

http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/primer3/input.htm

). Primer sequences are listed on Additional file

1

: Table S3 and PCR conditions are available on Additional file

.

Exome sequencing

Paired-end sequencing was performed using Illumina GAIIx/HiSeq 2000 instruments (Illumina, San Diego, CA) available at the Department of Genetic Medecine of the School of Medicine from Geneva. Sequence capture was performed using Agilent Sure Select Technology (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using either the All Exome kits or custom design corresponding to the linkage intervals and IBD regions. We typically obtain in excess of 30 million read pairs (60 million reads) of 76 nucleotides per GAIIx lane and 100 million reads pairs of 100 bp per HiSeq2000 lane allowing multiplexing of 2–3 exomes per lane.

Alignment of reads and call of single nucleotide variants and small indels were done using the latest version of MAQ/BWA [

46

] and PinDel [

47

] softwares. Only genetic variants with high-quality score were further investigated. Variant annotation was performed using the ANNOVAR package [

48

]. Generation of high-quality data necessary for reliable SNP detection across the targeted regions required 30-fold genomic coverage (equivalent to 15-fold coverage per haplotype).

Each DNA variant was subsequently compared to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP132, NCBI) and 1000genome project dataset. Only the unique and novel DNA variants were selected for additional filtering based on the nature of the mutation (gene structure location, nucleotide conservation, codon change, de novo occurrence) and familial segregation. Polyphen2 [

49

] and Sift [

50

] programs were used to assess the pathogenecity of the filtered variants. If necessary, the final list of potential pathogenic variants were further refined by selecting genes functionally relevant to epilepsy. T1478M of

CACNA1I

, S1720L of

TNRC6B

and S202P of

LDLRAP1

were further explored by classic Sanger sequencing and high resolution melt (HRM) assay using a Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument (Corbett Life Science, Australia). More details are given in Additional file

1. Introduction

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a widespread disease estimated to affect 83.6% of elderly individuals globally. This disease, which includes varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), is a prevalent medical condition among adults. CVD affects individuals worldwide, with the highest incidence in developed countries [

1

]. Reports describe venous leg ulcers as the most severe stage of chronic venous disease (CVD) [

2

]. CVD has significant consequences for individuals and society, affecting the quality of life through the experience of pain, heaviness, itching, and reduced mobility [

3

]. The most common cause of CVI is varicose veins in the lower extremities, with the most severe form resulting in venous ulceration. It is estimated that 30–40% of the adult population has varicose veins, and up to 6% of patients with varicose veins develop ulcers. In addition, 30% of varicose veins can develop into more severe forms of CVI.

The pathophysiology of CVD involves varicose veins, dysfunction of venous valves, and skin ulceration resulting from impaired cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis [

4

]. Vascular cell functions, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, are decisively regulated by microRNA (miRNA)-dependent gene expression modulation [

5

,

6

]. Many studies have revealed that miRNAs’ aberrant expression is associated with pathological conditions’ development [

7

]. In vascular disease, miRNAs have demonstrated modulatory functions in angiogenesis, endothelial cell dysfunction, and response to ischemic events [

8

]. Several miRNAs are regarded as potential biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases [

8

]. miRNAs and genes exhibit distinctive expression patterns in venous samples from patients with CVI compared to healthy patients [

9

,

10

,

11

,

12

]. Some works have separately proposed some biomarkers that could be used within CVD, and through functional analysis, seven genes (CDS2, HDAC5, PPP6R2, PRRC2B, TBC1D22A, WNK1, and PABPC3) selected as miRNA targets by in silico methods were recognized as potential biomarkers of CVD. However, their complete understanding remains elusive [

13

].

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, typically 21–25 nucleotides in length, originating from both coding and non-coding transcription units found in genic (intronic or exonic) and intergenic regions [

14

,

15

]. They are pivotal in regulating essential processes such as tissue homeostasis and cell signaling, operating at the post-transcriptional gene expression level [

16

]. These molecules also have an extracellular role and can be released into microvesicles, modulating gene expression in several tissues [

17

,

18

,

19

]. Both intracellular and extracellular miRNAs can be detected in tissue samples and various biological fluids, including serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat, and tears. However, this approach remains unexplored, and is mainly used in personalized medicine as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool.

Network representations have proven essential in depicting interactions among entities of interest across various domains. This tool is precious for analyzing and visualizing complex biological processes [

20

]. Leveraging known interactions discovered from previous experiments creates biological networks. These intricate molecular interaction networks provide valuable insights into biological processes, enabling us to pinpoint critical nodes and other topological features associated with complex phenotypes in health and disease [

21

]. According to network medicine theory, disease-associated phenotypes are hypothesized to result from perturbations in gene networks rather than individual gene mutations acting in isolation [

22

].

Restoring or inhibiting specific miRNAs in diseased cells can be accomplished through various strategies, including (1) delivering miRNA mimics or inhibitors using modified nucleic acids, (2) modifying miRNAs using viral delivery vector systems, (3) delivering miRNA mimics or inhibitors using nonviral delivery vector systems, and (4) developing small-molecule drugs that target microRNAs [

23

]. A further strategy has been using drugs, natural products, or plant extracts, which have been shown to modulate the expression of miRNAs through multiple mechanisms in various pathologies [

24

,

25

,

26

,

27

].

Hesperidin, a drug widely used in the treatment of CVD [

28

,

29

,

30

], has been demonstrated to enhance endothelial function by increasing the availability of nitric oxide (NO) while simultaneously suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers [

31

]. This flavonoid has been involved in modulating miRNAs by downregulating miR-21-5p and upregulating miR-16-5p and miR-34a-5p [

32

], which have been involved in the physiopathology of several cardiovascular diseases, including CVD [

4

,

33

,

34

,

35

], and has been considered to be used as a reference compound in our study.

In this sense, because of the critical participation of miRNA in gene expression in the development of CVD, we focused on identifying potential miRNAs and drugs that could modulate the expression of those miRNAs and may antagonize their profile expression during CVD. To achieve this aim, we employed a network-based approach. The data were collected from both the literature and miRNA-related databases to identify, by network analysis, potential molecules that interact with miRNAs regulated by hesperidin and that modify the gene expression involved in CVD derived from miRNAs collected from several studies with potential miRNA biomarker candidates and as potential therapeutic agents [

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Reviewing

Bibliographic Screening to Select MicroRNAs Involved in CVD

We searched the PubMed database from 2016 to 2024 using MESH terms such as microRNAs, miRNA, chronic venous disease, and chronic venous insufficiency. Two independent reviewers selected studies that met the eligibility criteria.

The bibliography considered in this work includes studies about miRNAs with significant expression profiles in CVD reported between 2016 and 2024, in vitro studies that included cases and control groups, and tests in human samples with validated CVD diagnoses. Studies not performed in English that do not include controls or duplicated data, studies conducted in animal models, or studies conducted in human-derived sources were excluded from this research.

2.2. Data Collection

We sought to analyze the genes influenced by the miRNAs identified through data extraction in both the reported bibliography (validated) and servers (predicted) from the Target Expression Analysis section of the miRDB-MicroRNA Target Prediction Database (

http://www.mirdb.org/mirdb/index.html

, accessed on 1 May 2024), considering those targets with a prediction score > 95%. The network analysis used the mirNET database to search for small molecules responsible for modulating CVD-associated miRNAs (

https://www.mirnet.ca

, accessed on 13 May 2024). The bar plot was generated using the ggplot2 package in R, leveraging information sourced from the literature and the Target Expression Analysis section of the miRDB-MicroRNA Target Prediction Database (

http://www.mirdb.org/mirdb/index.html

, accessed on 28 June 2024).

2.3. Network Structural Analysis

We employed Cytoscape software (v.3.10.2) to construct networks aiming to identify the most connected miRNAs and relevant pathways within the context of CVD [

41

]. The Cytohubba plugin was used to identify the most interconnected genes within the network [

42

]. To elucidate the potential principal signaling pathways modified by the miRNAs, we employed the JEPETTO plugin within Cytoscape [

43

]. The pathways exhibiting the most significant enrichment (

p

< 0.05) were adjusted using their XD scores based on the insights from the previous report [

44

].

2.4. Network Pharmacology Analysis

We utilized the Cytoscape software (v.3.10.2) to construct the structural networks [

41

] to analyze the information from the mirNET database and identify the chemical compounds responsible for modulating miRNAs involved in CVD (

https://www.mirnet.ca

, accessed on 29 June 2024). The Cytohubba plugin was used to identify the most connected genes in the network. [

42

]. Furthermore, the highly interconnected small molecules were identified based on their scores, and an in-depth exploration of their respective functions was conducted in the literature.

To search for molecules with the same targeted miRNAs as hesperidin, (1) we generated a dataset of miRNAs targeted by hesperidin. These miRNAs were obtained from the SM2miR server (

http://www.jianglab.cn/SM2miR/

, accessed on 30 June 2024). This server allows us to identify whether those miRNAs targeted by hesperidin were up- or downregulated. (2) Subsequently, we obtained each sequence of those miRNAs upregulated or downregulated by hesperidin, searching the miRNA accession number in the miRbase server (

https://www.mirbase.org/

, accessed on 1 July 2024) [

45

]. (3) We analyzed each miRNA sequence and predicted other molecules that also regulate those same miRNAs in the PSRR (Prediction of SM-miRNA Regulation pairs by random forest) server (

https://rnadrug.shinyapps.io/PSRR/

, accessed on 2 July 2024). Using this random forest algorithm, we achieved the highest AUC values of 0.911 for the upregulation model and 0.896 for the downregulation model on the testing datasets, outperforming four other machine learning algorithms [

46

]. These molecules were employed to construct a structural network using the Cytoscape software (v.3.10.2) [

41

], and the results were analyzed with the Cytohubba plugin [

42

]. We considered those molecules with high degree centrality, which tends to highlight nodes (molecules) with higher degrees (more direct connections), and betweenness centrality, to identify those nodes (molecules) that lie on critical paths between others.

2.5. Using QED Index to Determine Drug-like Candidates

To determine the drug-likeness using the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), we used the DruLito software (

https://drulito.software.informer.com/

, accessed on 4 July 2024), as previously described [

47

]. This index has enabled us to identify compounds with favorable oral administration characteristics [

48

]. The DruLito software (version 1.0.0) evaluated SDF files from PubChem. Our analysis focused solely on molecules that were accessible via this server. The analytical data are reported in

Supplementary Materials Tables S1–S10

.

3. Results

After reviewing the literature and applying the filters mentioned in the methods for bibliographical screening, we created different networks using the selected studies.

Scheme 1

, according to the PRISMA statement, outlines the article selection criteria for subsequent analysis. A carefully selected database of differentially expressed miRNAs in cardiovascular disease was acquired to determine the most pertinent miRNAs. A structural network analysis was built to find the common miRNAs between the countries where these studies were performed. The data for this network analysis were collected from studies where the detection methods, tissues, and expression of each miRNA were found (

Figure 1

). The three most outstanding sources were the proximal part of the significant saphenous vein tissue, vein tissues, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This network analysis found that Poland researched CVD-associated miRNAs most, followed by China, the UK, and the USA. The most effective methods for diagnosing CVD were microarray and RT-PCR. The analysis identified several interconnected miRNAs within the network, including miR-34a, miR-34c, miR-202-3, miR-1202, and miR-130a. The analysis detected miR-34a in wound-edge epidermal keratinocytes and the proximal part of the significant saphenous vein tissue using microarray, RT-PCR, and RT-PCR validation methods.

To identify the miRNAs that regulate the most significant number of genes and to find critical miRNAs that could regulate numerous genes, we utilized our complete dataset of miRNAs (

Table S1

) from the miRBD database (

http://www.mirdb.org/mirdb/index.html

, accessed on 28 June 2024) to identify genes and pathways that interact with them. We only considered target genes with a score above 95% (

Figure 2

).

Figure 2

A depicts the genes regulated by each miRNA involved in CVD found in the miRBD database, including miR-593-3p (135 genes), miR-19a-3p (127 genes), miR-92a-3p (116 genes), miR-301a-3p (92 genes), and mir-181a-2-3p (87 genes).

Figure 2

B depicts the number of nodes (genes) interacting with the whole miRNA dataset and shows the most regulated targets indicated by the miRBD database. Using this new set, we created another network with the genes altered by these miRNAs.

We further analyze the structural network in

Figure 2

, which shows the most connected nodes. The most connected genes were WNK-1, IL1RN, PPP6R2, PRRC2B, and ADIPOQ, and the most connected miRNAs were hsa-miR-106b-3p, has-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-454-3p, hsa-miR-548ac, and hsa-miR-128-3p (

Figure 3

).

After defining these most connected and relevant genes involved during CVD, they were used to perform an enrichment analysis to better understand the pathophysiology of CVD. The targeted genes of the miRNAs involved in CVD were analyzed to correlate CVD with other pathways or processes.

Table 1

lists the most relevant pathways or processes associated with CVI. Lately, a pharmacology network analysis was conducted considering the most relevant miRNAs from the dataset and the compounds present in the mirNET database (

https://www.mirnet.ca/upload/MirUploadView.xhtml

, accessed on 29 June 2024) (

Figure 4

and

Table 2

). This analysis was performed to find small molecules of different natures that could interact with our most relevant miRNAs. Interestingly, the interactions inside the network showed that drugs and toxicants could modulate such miRNAs. This network showed that the reported phlebotonic drug hesperidin shares several miRNAs with the natural compound curcumin.

Table 2

displays the most relevant features of each compound. Furthermore, the interactions within the network suggest that drugs and toxicants have the potential to modulate these miRNAs. As a result, it is crucial to consider their influence on toxicological analysis and in conducting further ecological and epidemiological studies (

Table 3

).

To further analyze the interactions between the miRNAs targeted by hesperidin, determining if this molecule influences their regulation, and thus determine new candidates that can also share and similarly regulate these miRNAs targeted by hesperidin, we generated a network structural analysis to determine those molecules that were most connected and shared more intermediates within this network (

Figure 5

). For more information on how this network was built, see the Materials and Methods.

Table 4

shows the degree and betweenness values of the most relevant molecules in this network (20 molecules).

Finally, we determined their drug-likeness through the QED index to analyze whether these most relevant molecules could be suitable candidates for oral administration. At the end of the analysis of the eighteen molecules obtained from the study of the structural networks that share miRNAs with hesperidin, only six met this QED index criteria of a value greater than 0.5, identifying desoximetasone, curcumin, flurandrenolide, fludrocortisone, diflorasone, and reversine as the most suitable candidates to be administered orally in this study (

Table 4

).

4. Discussion

CVD is a multifactorial condition characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms [

40

], among which the non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs, regulate multiple functions in biological and pathological processes, positively or negatively, promoting or not the action of the corresponding mRNA product. Numerous miRNAs can be biomarkers for several diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and sepsis [

92

]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be released into the bloodstream, where they exist as stable circulating free miRNAs or remain safeguarded from endogenous RNAse enzyme activity through encapsulation in exosomes or proteins [

93

]. Numerous reports have described the significant role of miRNAs in processes closely associated with vascular pathology, such as angiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular inflammation. Therefore, dysregulation of the miRNA expression profiles could be considered a promising biomarker of CVD [

94

].

Although few studies have been carried out, most of these studies come from the USA, Poland, China, and the UK. However, there were no studies in Latin America, so many aspects of CVD and miRNAs are still unknown in this population. Thus, urgent research must be translated into clinical practice.

One of the most connected miRNAs is miR-34a. This miRNA has been extensively studied in cancer biology in in vitro conditions due to its role as a tumor suppressor. During cancer development, this miRNA has been demonstrated to impact several crucial processes, including cell cycle progression, self-renewal, senescence, apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, differentiation, migration, and metastasis. Evidence indicates that miR-34a is a crucial regulator of age-related tissue modifications and a promoter of cellular senescence. Levels of miR-34a have shown an increase with age. This increase is found in several organs, including the muscle, heart, and aorta, and it promotes detrimental organ remodeling and functional decline. In the cardiovascular system, miR-34a promotes the senescence of endothelial cells (ECs) in the vascular wall and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), principally by direct negative regulation of its best-known target, the longevity-associated gene sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [

95

]. This pathway promotes arterial inflammation and the development of age-related VD.

Furthermore, miR-34a expression could be influenced by other risk factors promoting vascular changes similar to aging [

95

]. These features make this miRNA a suitable target for treating VD. It has been described as a target of flavonoids inhibiting miR-34a synthesis and upregulation of SIRT1 expression, protecting endothelial cells from senescence [

96

]. This finding correlates with the literature because most drugs to treat VD come from a flavonoid nature [

30

].

Furthermore, miR-34a targets XIAP [

97

], which has been implicated in resistance to apoptosis, a phenomenon possibly related to the downregulation of apoptosis in the medial layer of varicose veins [

98

]. This resistance to apoptosis has also been found in SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype), where varicose veins lead to vascular endothelium dysfunction, causing a pro-inflammatory environment [

99

]. Expression of miR-34a has shown significant upregulation in both the plasma and atherosclerotic plaques of patients diagnosed with CAD (coronary artery disease). This finding suggests that overexpression of miR-34a in our study is common in both arterial and venous pathology. Also, this result agrees with the research performed by Zalewski et al. [

4

], where this miRNA was found to be upregulated in patients with CVD. By integrating both experimental and predictive data analysis in our review, mir-34a is an outstanding miRNA and may be used as a potential biomarker for the early detection of CVD.

miR-34c has been associated with several cellular processes in the cardiovascular system [

100

], playing a protective role in hypoxia by activating autophagy through repressing BCL2. Significant cellular stress is produced during hypoxia that originates diverse pathological consequences, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers [

101

].

miR-202-3p is downregulated during CVD. This downregulation is involved in metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) overexpression. MMP1 promotes trans-endothelial migration by degrading inter-endothelial junctions and disrupting endothelial integrity [

102

]. Thus, this loss in miR-202-3p expression may increase the activity of the MMP-1, which plays a role in CDV pathogenesis [

103

]. miR-1202 plays regulatory roles in MMP9 function during CVD development. However, it is required to evaluate their potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility [

37

]. This finding agrees with the results obtained by Zalewski et al., where miR-1202 is downregulated in patients with varicose veins. Thus, our findings also propose this miRNA as a valuable potential biomarker [

94

]. miR-130a was the most interconnected miRNA in this network. miR-130a has been reported in skin biopsies from venous ulcers, compared to standard skin specimens [

94

]. An association with the overexpression of these miRNAs has been established because they may inhibit wound healing by targeting LepR [

4

,

94

].

Interestingly, the other most connected miRNAs, miR-106b-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-454-3p, miR-548ac, and miR-128-3p, were obtained by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PBMCs of patients with varicose veins [

94

]. These findings allow us to know the relevance of NGS and PBMCs in diagnosing VD.

According to structural network analysis, the most connected genes were WNK-1, IL1NR, PPP6R2, PRRC2B, and ADIPOQ WNK1, which have been associated with downregulation of miR-181a-2-3p and miR-106b-3p in previous reports [

4

]. WNK1 plays a role in endothelial cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and invasion [

104

]. In mouse model studies, the lack of the WNK1 gene leads to embryonic death due to angiogenic and cardiovascular defects [

104

]. The hypothesis postulates that the upregulation of WNK1 is associated with the downregulation of miR-181a-2-3p and miR-106b-3p, thereby leading to the induction of inflammation and aging in response to oxidative stress in CVD [

4

]. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) has a biological role in the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1. This downregulation may be implicated in the chronic inflammation of the CVD [

105

]. The PPP6R2 gene is upregulated during CVD. This gene encodes proteins that act as a significant T-loop phosphatase for Aurora A, a crucial mitotic kinase. Aurora A activation is very complex and occurs at specific subcellular locations due to signaling events, including phosphorylation and oxidation [

106

]. Aurora A controls key oncogenic pathways associated with drug resistance and poor patient outcomes [

106

]. According to the findings of this study, several miRNAs are present in both CVD and some types of cancer. PPP6R2 may be a potential early biomarker for CVD and cancer.

PRRC2B

has been reported as possibly upregulated by miR-92a-3p [

4

]. This gene-encoding protein is involved in brain development. As noted by Zalewski et al., specific neurodevelopmental processes might be implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD, highlighting potential associations between vascular and neurodegenerative disorders [

4

]. However, the network analysis showed another potential biomarker in this study, the ADIPOQ gene. ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms are related to adiponectin levels, insulin resistance, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type II (DMT2) [

107

]. This finding also connects with WNK, which is involved in DMT2 [

108

,

109

] and vascular disorders [

110

]. In this context, evidence has been proposed that the incidence of diabetes mellitus is much higher in patients with CVI. More intense therapy directed against CVI in diabetic patients could potentiate the prevention of complications such as leg edema, deep vein thrombosis, progression of CVI, and post-thrombotic syndrome and improve the quality of life [

111

].

For the first time, small molecules (toxins and drugs) that regulate the expression of several miRNAs are involved in a CVD study through structural network analysis. Certain identified compounds include standard air or water contaminants and drugs that possess the potential to regulate miRNAs associated with CVD and its progression. Formaldehyde (FA), a prevalent air pollutant, is identified among xenobiotics and is widely encountered in nature, industrial processes, and various consumer products [

67

,

112

]. Its long-term exposure may provoke skin disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease [

113

]. This small molecule alters vascular function and oxidative stress, influencing cardiovascular health [

113

]. Exposure to FA from various sources can lead to heart diseases, including arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and atherosclerosis (AS) [

112

]. Acute FA exposure has influenced adult female vascular function in the arms and legs, decreasing conduit vessel function without altering microvascular function [

113

]. Also, FA causes an increase in blood pressure by activating the ACE/AT1R axis [

114

], so its exposure may be involved in the development of hypertension, which has been proposed as a potential cause of the early development of CVD [

114

,

115

,

116

,

117

,

118

]. Additional research is imperative to ascertain the diverse effects of varying concentrations and durations of FA exposure in both genders, older adults, and individuals who are particularly susceptible to cardiovascular disease, including CVD. Ethanol has been shown to induce vascular toxicity, linking patients with disorders associated with excessive ethanol consumption and the development of CVD. This process has been described through the modulation of the AT1 receptor with vascular hyper-contractility, promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS production, and reduced bioavailability of NO and H

2

O

2

[

119

].

17beta-estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol are estrogens [

68

,

73

]. Estrogens are critical regulators of vascular homeostasis, primarily functioning through ERα and ERβ, which serve as ligand-gated transcription factors. Research findings have revealed a substantial upregulation in the expression of ERα, ERβ, and GPER in the tissue of individuals with CVD. This upregulation has been associated with disease severity and has shown a correlation with the clinical stage of VD [

120

]. In addition, a large group of heterogeneous drugs with anticancer properties showed significant interactions with the miRNAs proposed by our network analysis. These results could be because most of the miRNAs in this study are involved in the development of, or are potential targets of, some cancers [

102

,

121

,

122

,

123

,

124

,

125

,

126

,

127

,

128

,

129

]. Our data agree with the evidence that shows that CVD may have a relationship with the development of cancer [

130

,

131

]. These results encourage more extensive and in-depth studies to be carried out to elucidate the pathogenesis mechanisms shared by both CVD and the development of some types of cancer.

Among the compounds that share those miRNAs that are targeted by the reference compound, hesperidin, we find a group of heterogeneous molecules of different types, such as corticosteroids, diarylheptanoids, antivirals, nucleoside analogs, oncology drugs, purine derivatives, estrogen receptor modulators, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Interestingly, many of these small molecules are oncology drugs. This result correlates with that last obtained with the network analysis because of the close relationship that may occur between the miRNAs involved in CVD and cancer. In this context, hesperidin has been established to have potential use in cancer therapy [

132

]. Furthermore, this is the first study proposing candidates for the treatment of CVD using miRNA-based and network pharmacology approaches, compared to previous studies using virtual screening and network pharmacology approaches [

133

]. This approach would open new possibilities for finding new candidates to treat CVD.

The employing of corticosteroids in cardiovascular diseases has been controversial because it has been associated with adverse cardiac effects such as cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling [

134

]. However, Ospina-Quintero et al. [

135

] found that a low dose of vitamin D and dexamethasone can protect against heart disease when administered subcutaneously and repeatedly. This is because it induces the production of IL-10 by a network of lymphoid and myeloid immune cells. Also, Wang et al. [

136

] indicated that administering low doses of dexamethasone yielded cardioprotective effects in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) mice. These effects were manifested through the enhancement of cardiac function, attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppression of inflammatory responses, and stimulation of anti-oxidant responses. Additionally, the study by Wang et al. revealed that the protective mechanisms of dexamethasone on myocardial tissues were mediated through the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. [

136

]. Therefore, dexamethasone could have a protective effect on cardiovascular diseases, including CVD. However, more studies are necessary to support these hypotheses. These analyses may also be carried out at a clinical level, along with the other corticosteroids in this study.

Curcumin and hesperidin share many miRNAs. Hesperidin, a flavonone predominantly found in citrus fruits, is proposed to have the potential to serve as a therapeutic agent for the modulation of several cardiovascular diseases [

58

]. Curcumin demonstrates substantial efficacy in mitigating cardiomyocyte injury after ischemia and hypoxia, as well as in inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, ameliorating ventricular remodeling, and attenuating drug-induced myocardial injury. Furthermore, it shows promise in improving diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), alleviating vascular endothelial dysfunction, impeding foam cell formation, and reducing the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Clinical studies have substantiated the protective impact of curcumin on blood vessels, while toxicological investigations have confirmed its safety profile. Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that elevated doses of curcumin may induce adverse effects, including hepatic impairment and perturbations in embryonic heart development [

137

]. These characteristics could propose curcumin as a drug with therapeutic potential for CVD.

Reversine, alternatively known as 2-(4-morpholinoanilino)-6-cyclohexylaminopurine, is a derivative of 2,6-disubstituted purine. This diminutive molecule exhibits encouraging antitumor characteristics by impeding diverse kinases that govern the cell cycle and cytokinesis. Through the application of network pharmacology prediction, molecular docking, and systematic review, it has been determined that MEK1 could potentially serve as a promising target for the action of reversine [

138

]. MEK1-ERK1/2 pathways are part of the MAPK cascade and have been implicated in regulating myocyte survival following ischemia–reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, and anthracycline exposure. These pathways have been associated with cardioprotective effects by directly antagonizing myocyte apoptosis [

139

] and play a crucial role in the signaling and transcriptional pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of heart and vascular disease via the MEK-ERK-Egr-1 axis [

140

]. These data open a new line of study on miRNAs as potential biomarkers of CVD, genes, and contaminants or drugs that could be involved in developing or treating CVD.

5. Conclusions

Despite efforts to compile the available information on miRNAs and CVD, this review has limitations. Among the challenges encountered were the following: the studies were heterogeneous and there was an absence of pertinent clinical data, as well as a lack of a comprehensive survey on individual lifestyles, ethnicities, sample collection, methodologies, heterogeneity in protocols, miRNA isolation, comorbidities, and servers used for miRNA analysis. Additional epidemiological research is urgently required to comprehend the potential of miRNAs as a treatment for CVD or as a prospective risk factor for its development. Furthermore, a notable absence of Latin American representation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) profiles has been observed, underscoring the necessity of incorporating this demographic in forthcoming research endeavors. Notwithstanding these constraints, our study meticulously consolidated the foremost findings, delineating miRNA profiles prevalent in CVD. Our in silico strategies suggest possible associations between CVD and xenobiotic agents, including 5-Aza-CdR, arsenic, trichostatin A, and endogenous hormones.

Furthermore, the network analysis allowed us to identify potential drug-like compounds that share targeted miRNAs by hesperidin: desoximetasone, curcumin, flurandrenolide, fludrocortisone, diflorasone, and reversine. These compounds may be investigated in future preclinical or clinical studies to treat CVD. It is crucial to investigate these drugs deeper. Furthermore, the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CVD should be supported.
