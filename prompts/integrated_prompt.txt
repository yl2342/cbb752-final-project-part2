# Gene: SEZ6L (3 abstracts)
### SEZ6L - Abstract 1: The beta-Secretase Substrate Seizure 6-Like Protein (SEZ6L) Controls Motor Functions  in Mice.
<Journal>: Molecular neurobiology
<Date>: 2022 Feb
<PMID>: 34958451
<Content>: The membrane protein seizure 6-like (SEZ6L) is a neuronal substrate of the  Alzheimer's disease protease BACE1, and little is known about its physiological function in the nervous system. Here, we show that SEZ6L constitutive knockout mice display motor phenotypes in adulthood, including changes in gait and decreased motor coordination. Additionally, SEZ6L knockout mice displayed increased anxiety-like behaviour, although spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze were normal. Analysis of the gross anatomy and proteome of the adult SEZ6L knockout cerebellum did not reveal any major differences compared to wild type, indicating that lack of SEZ6L in other regions of the nervous system may contribute to the phenotypes observed. In summary, our study establishes physiological functions for SEZ6L in regulating motor coordination and curbing anxiety-related behaviour, indicating that aberrant SEZ6L function in the human nervous system may contribute to movement disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases.

### SEZ6L - Abstract 2: Seizure 6-like (SEZ6L) gene and risk for lung cancer.
<Journal>: Cancer research
<Date>: 2007 Sep 1
<PMID>: 17804757
<Content>: DNA pooling in combination with high-throughput sequencing was done as a part of  the Sequenom-Genefinder project. In the pilot study, we tested 83,715 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), located primarily in gene-based regions, to identify polymorphic susceptibility variants for lung cancer. For this pilot study, 369 male cases and 287 controls of both sexes (white Europeans of Southern German origin) were analyzed. The study identified a candidate region in 22q12.2 that contained numerous SNPs showing significant case-control differences and that coincides with a region that was shown previously to be frequently deleted in lung cancer cell lines. The candidate region overlies the seizure 6-like (SEZ6L) gene. The pilot study identified a polymorphic Met430Ile substitution in the SEZ6L gene (SNP rs663048) as the top candidate for a variant modulating risk of lung cancer. Two replication studies were conducted to assess the association of SNP rs663048 with lung cancer risk. The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center study included 289 cases and 291 controls matched for gender, age, and smoking status. The Liverpool Lung Project (a United Kingdom study) included 248 cases and 233 controls. Both replication studies showed an association of the rs663048 with lung cancer risk. The homozygotes for the variant allele had more than a 3-fold risk compared with the wild-type homozygotes [combined odds ratio (OR), 3.32; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.81-7.21]. Heterozygotes also had a significantly elevated risk of lung cancer from the combined replication studies with an OR of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.04-1.59). The effect remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, and pack-years of tobacco smoke. We also compared expression of SEZ6L in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (n = 7), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 52), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 22) cell lines by using Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B GeneChips. We found that the average expression level of SEZ6L in NSCLC cell lines was almost two times higher and in SCLC cell lines more than six times higher when compared with normal lung epithelial cell lines. Using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database, we found a approximately 2-fold elevated and statistically significant (P = 0.004) level of SEZ6L expression in tumor samples compared with normal lung tissues. In conclusion, the results of these studies representing 906 cases compared with 811 controls indicate a role of the SEZ6L Met430Ile polymorphic variant in increasing lung cancer risk.

### SEZ6L - Abstract 3: Identification of a 428-kb homozygously deleted region disrupting the SEZ6L gene  at 22q12.1 in a lung cancer cell line.
<Journal>: Oncogene
<Date>: 2000 Dec 14
<PMID>: 11175339
<Content>: Frequent allelic losses on chromosome 22q in small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs)  and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas indicate the presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) on this chromosome arm. We detected a homozygous deletion at 22q12.1 in a SCLC cell line, Lu24. Cloning of the breakpoints of the Lu24 deletion revealed that the deletion was interstitial and 428, 131 bp in size. The deleted region contained the SEZ6L (Seizure 6-like) gene, whose structure had been partially determined by the chromosome 22 sequencing project. We determined the full length cDNA sequence for the SEZ6L gene based on the genomic sequence for the SEZ6L locus using the GENSCAN program and the RT - PCR method. The deduced SEZ6L protein was a transmembrane protein of 1024 amino acids with multiple domains involved in protein - protein interaction and signal transduction. SEZ6L expression was detected in a variety of human tissues, including lung, while its expression was detected in 14 (30%) of 46 lung cancer cell lines examined. Missense mutations were detected in three (7%) of the 46 cell lines, and a 1 bp deletion in the polypyrimidine tract preceding exon 4 was detected in one (2%) of 46 primary lung cancers. Therefore, it is possible that genetic and/or epigenetic SEZ6L alterations are involved in the development and/or progression in a subset of lung cancer, although functional analysis of the SEZ6L gene as well as molecular analysis of other genes in the homozygously deleted region is necessary to understand the pathogenetic significance of 22q deletions in human lung carcinogenesis.

# Gene: EFCAB6 (1 abstracts)
### EFCAB6 - Abstract 1: Identification of a HMGA2-EFCAB6 gene rearrangement following next-generation  sequencing in a patient with a t(12;22)(q14.3;q13.2) and JAK2V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasm.
<Journal>: Cancer genetics
<Date>: 2012 Jun
<PMID>: 22749035
<Content>: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) result from genetically altered hematopoietic  stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage differentiation. The study of genomic mutations identified so far suggests that they occur after a common ancestral event or that different mutations result in similar MPN phenotypes. We report analysis of a chromosomal translocation, t(12;22)(q14.3;q13.2), in a patient with a BCR-ABL1-negative, JAK2V617F-positive MPN. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array and targeted sequencing detected no mutation in nine genes reported to influence the JAK2V617F-driven MPNs (MPL, LNK, CBL, TET2, EZH2, IKZF1, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1). Next-generation sequencing revealed a balanced HMGA2-EFCAB6 genomic rearrangement. The HMGA2 breakpoint leads to the loss of seven 3'UTR binding sites for the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 tumor suppressor. The breakpoint in the EFCAB6 gene abrogates transcription of EFCAB6. Measurement of expression showed retention of HMGA2 transcription and no detectable EFCAB6 transcript. Allele burden comparison in a sample containing the translocation, showed 90% HMGA2-EFCAB6 versus 50% JAK2V617F allele dose, suggesting HMGA2-EFCAB6 rearrangement plays a more ancestral role, pre-JAK2V617F, in the neoplastic process. The pathogenicity of the translocation may rest on collaborations among JAK2V617F-induced constitutive activation of JAK2, the oncogenic property of HMGA2, and disrupted pathways, such as alteration in DJ-1 expression, resulting from the impact of EFCAB6 abrogation.

# Gene: SYN3 (9 abstracts)
### SYN3 - Abstract 1: Enhancement of intravesical delivery with Syn3 potentiates interferon-alpha2b  gene therapy for superficial bladder cancer.
<Journal>: Cytokine & growth factor reviews
<Date>: 2007 Oct-Dec
<PMID>: 17692556
<Content>: Intravesical administration of interferon alpha-2b protein (IFN) has been  successfully used in the treatment of patients with superficial bladder tumors. Local dosing of IFN minimizes well-known systemic side effects of the drug, but exposure to bladder tumors is limited by the duration of instillation and transient concentrations achieved in the urothelium. Intravesical delivery of the gene encoding interferon results in an alternative strategy for IFN-based therapy of the disease, enabling sustained exposure of IFN protein that results from production by tumor and non-tumor cells in the urothelium. Efficient gene delivery and expression of IFN has been achieved using a recombinant adenovirus gene delivery system (rAd-IFN) in conjunction with the novel small molecule excipient Syn3. Studies with rAd-IFN/Syn3 in animal models result in urine concentrations of IFN that persisted for weeks and correlated with potent anti-tumor effects. The objective of this review is to communicate the rationale and preclinical findings that support ongoing clinical investigation of intravesical rAd-IFN/Syn3 in superficial bladder cancer.

### SYN3 - Abstract 2: Intravesical rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 for Patients With High-Grade, Bacillus  Calmette-Guerin-Refractory or Relapsed Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Phase II Randomized Study.
<Journal>: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of 
<Date>: 2017 Oct 20
<PMID>: 28834453
<Content>: Purpose Many patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)  are either refractory to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment or may experience disease relapse. We assessed the efficacy and safety of recombinant adenovirus interferon alfa with Syn3 (rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3), a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus gene transfer vector, for patients with high-grade (HG) BCG-refractory or relapsed NMIBC. Methods In this open-label, multicenter (n = 13), parallel-arm, phase II study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01687244), 43 patients with HG BCG-refractory or relapsed NMIBC received intravesical rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 (randomly assigned 1:1 to 1 x 10(11) viral particles (vp)/mL or 3 x 10(11) vp/mL). Patients who responded at months 3, 6, and 9 were retreated at months 4, 7, and 10. The primary end point was 12-month HG recurrence-free survival (RFS). All patients who received at least one dose were included in efficacy and safety analyses. Results Forty patients received rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 (1 x 10(11) vp/mL, n = 21; 3 x 10(11) vp/mL, n = 19) between November 5, 2012, and April 8, 2015. Fourteen patients (35.0%; 90% CI, 22.6% to 49.2%) remained free of HG recurrence 12 months after initial treatment. Comparable 12-month HG RFS was noted for both doses. Of these 14 patients, two experienced recurrence at 21 and 28 months, respectively, after treatment initiation, and one died as a result of an upper tract tumor at 17 months without a recurrence. rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 was well tolerated; no grade four or five adverse events (AEs) occurred, and no patient discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were micturition urgency (n = 16; 40%), dysuria (n = 16; 40%), fatigue (n = 13; 32.5%), pollakiuria (n = 11; 28%), and hematuria and nocturia (n = 10 each; 25%). Conclusion rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 was well tolerated. It demonstrated promising efficacy for patients with HG NMIBC after BCG therapy who were unable or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy.

### SYN3 - Abstract 3: Syn3 provides high levels of intravesical adenoviral-mediated gene transfer for  gene therapy of genetically altered urothelium and superficial bladder cancer.
<Journal>: Cancer gene therapy
<Date>: 2002 Aug
<PMID>: 12136430
<Content>: Using our model to grow superficial human bladder cancer in the mouse bladder, we  have found that the polyamide compound, Syn3, when injected intravesically for 1 hour at 1 mg/mL on two consecutive days, markedly increases rAd-beta-gal intravesical gene transfer and expression. This enhanced transgene expression was much greater than obtain by the use of 22% ethanol, which had previously been shown to increase intravesical adenoviral gene transfer, whereas little or no gene expression was seen with exposure to only rAd-beta-gal. beta-Galactosidase staining was seen in virtually every normal urothelial and superficial tumor cell present, including tumors that express little or no coxsackie-adenovirus receptors when Syn3 was present. High adenoviral-mediated gene transfer was also documented in the pig bladder using Syn3 in a similar protocol. Therefore, Syn3 may overcome the limitations of adequate intravesical adenoviral-mediated gene transfer and, when combined with an appropriate adenoviral-mediated gene, could offer an effective approach to the treatment of superficial bladder cancer and perhaps even genetically altered precursor lesions.

### SYN3 - Abstract 4: Phase I trial of intravesical recombinant adenovirus mediated interferon-alpha2b  formulated in Syn3 for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin failures in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.
<Journal>: The Journal of urology
<Date>: 2013 Sep
<PMID>: 23507396
<Content>: PURPOSE: A phase I trial of intravesical recombinant adenovirus mediated  interferon-alpha2b gene therapy (rAd-IFNalpha) formulated with the excipient SCH Syn3 was conducted in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer who had disease recurrence after treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The primary objective was to determine the safety of rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3. Secondary end points were demonstrated effective rAd-IFNalpha gene expression and preliminary evidence of clinical activity at 3 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 17 patients with recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer after bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment were enrolled in the study. A single treatment of rAd-IFNalpha (3 x 10(9) to 3 x 10(11) particles per ml) formulated with the excipient Syn3 was administered. Patient safety was evaluated for 12 or more weeks. Efficacy of gene transfer was determined by urine IFNalpha protein concentrations. Preliminary drug efficacy was determined at 3 months. RESULTS: Intravesical rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 was well tolerated as no dose limiting toxicity was encountered. Urgency was the most common adverse event and all cases were grade 1 or 2. rAd-IFNalpha DNA was not detected in the blood. However, transient low serum IFNalpha and Syn3 levels were measured. High and prolonged dose related urine IFNalpha levels were achieved with the initial treatment. Of the 14 patients treated at doses of 10(10) or more particles per ml with detectable urine IFNalpha, 6 (43%) experienced a complete response at 3 months and 2 remained disease-free at 29.0 and 39.2 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicity encountered. Dose dependent urinary IFNalpha concentrations confirmed efficient gene transfer and expression. Intravesical rAd-IFNalpha/Syn3 demonstrated clinical activity in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer recurring after bacillus Calmette-Guerin.

### SYN3 - Abstract 5: Influence of TIMP3/SYN3 polymorphisms on the phenotypic presentation of  age-related macular degeneration.
<Journal>: European journal of human genetics : EJHG
<Date>: 2013 Oct
<PMID>: 23422939
<Content>: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible central  visual loss in the elderly. A recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported that rs9621532 near the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3)/synapsin III (SYN3) region of 22q12.3 is associated with AMD. In this study, we characterize its phenotypic influence on AMD using three independent study cohorts: case-control studies from the National Eye Institute Clinical Center (NEI, n=397) and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (n=523) as well as a nested case-control study from Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES, n=852). Comparisons between cases and controls show no association between rs9621532 and AMD in the three sample sets. However, stratifying NEI cases uncovers a moderate protective role of rs9621532 in neovascular AMD (nAMD) and the association adhered to a dominant model (odds ratios=0.32; 95% CI: 0.11-0.89; P=0.02). The BMES data followed the same pattern of association with nAMD as that seen in the NEI sample but did not reach statistical significance. Polychotomous logistic regression showed a trend that rs9621532 correlates with less severe disease, for example, with the majority of carriers having intermediate AMD rather than nAMD/geographic atrophy AMD. Functionally, rs9621532 influences TIMP3 mRNA expression in cultured primary human fetal retinal pigment epithelium (hfRPE) cells. In hfRPE donors carrying the protective rs9625132 allele, we measured a reduction in TIMP3 mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. Our data suggest that rs9621532 carriers have a lower risk of developing nAMD, potentially because of decreased transcription of TIMP3.

### SYN3 - Abstract 6: Phase 1b Trial to Evaluate Tissue Response to a Second Dose of Intravesical  Recombinant Adenoviral Interferon alpha2b Formulated in Syn3 for Failures of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Therapy in Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.
<Journal>: Annals of surgical oncology
<Date>: 2016 Nov
<PMID>: 27387678
<Content>: BACKGROUND: A phase 1b trial was conducted to evaluate the duration of  interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) production after intravesical administration of recombinant adenovirus-mediated interferon alpha2b (Ad-IFN) formulated with the excipient Syn3. The primary aim was to determine whether a second instillation 3 days after initial treatment produced prolonged urinary IFN production. METHODS: The study enrolled seven patients who experienced recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer after bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy. Each treatment consisted of intravesical instillation of SCH721015 (Syn3) and Ad-IFN at a concentration of 3 x 10(11) particles/mL to a total volume of 75 mL given on days 1 and 4. The patients were followed for 12 weeks, during which the magnitude and duration of gene transfer were determined by urine INFalpha levels. Drug efficacy was determined by cystoscopy and biopsy, and patients who had no recurrence at 12 weeks were eligible for a second course of treatment. RESULTS: Seven patients were treated with an initial course (instillation on days 1 and 4). Two of the patients had a complete response at 12 weeks and received a second course of treatment. One patient remained without evidence of recurrence after a second course (total 24 weeks). One patient experienced a non-treatment-associated adverse event. Despite a transient rise in IFNalpha levels, sustained production was not demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Previously, Ad-IFNalpha intravesical therapy has shown promising drug efficacy. A prior phase 1 trial with a single instillation compared similarly with the current study, suggesting that a second instillation is not necessary to achieve sufficient urinary IFNalpha levels.

### SYN3 - Abstract 7: Use of monitoring levels of soluble forms of cytokeratin 18 in the urine of  patients with superficial bladder cancer following intravesical Ad-IFNalpha/Syn3 treatment in a phase l study.
<Journal>: Cancer gene therapy
<Date>: 2014 Mar
<PMID>: 24503570
<Content>: A phase l study using intravesical Ad-IFNalphaSyn3 for patients with bacillus  Calmette-Guerin-resistant superficial bladder cancer showed a complete remission (CR) of 43% at 90 days after treatment with high levels of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) being produced. Ad-IFNalpha kills bladder cancer cells by two apoptotic and one necrotic mechanism that can be measured by soluble forms of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) using M30 and M65 ELISAs, assays for caspase-cleaved (apoptotic) and uncleaved (necrotic) cell death, respectively. Therefore, we determined whether M30 and M65 levels in the urine after treatment could document all three mechanisms of cancer cell kill and also predict having a CR. High levels of both M30 and M65 were found in all patients within 24 h after treatment with all three types of cancer cell death occurring. Moreover, the return of both M30 and M65 levels in the urine to normal levels within 5 days or more after treatment was strongly associated with obtaining a CR (P=0.003). This is the first time that such assays have been used to study response to therapy in the urine of patients with bladder cancer and in the future may prove valuable in predicting clinical outcome.

### SYN3 - Abstract 8: The syn3 strain HSZP of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is not pathogenic for  mice and shows limited neural spread.
<Journal>: Virus research
<Date>: 1996 Jul
<PMID>: 8822632
<Content>: Strain HSZP of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) forms large giant cells in  vitro. This property was found associated with a mutation that alters the codon CGC (in the strain KOS or 17 sequence) to CAC (in the HSZP sequence), changing the amino acid 857 from arginine to histidine in the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein B (gB) polypeptide chain. Giant cell formation by ANGpath was attributed to a mutation that alters the codon GCC (in KOS and strain 17 sequences) to GTC (in ANGpath sequence) changing the amino acid 854 in the same (syn3) region of the gB molecule. In contrast to the ANGpath virus, which is pathogenic (1 LD50 < 1 x 10(4) PFU) for adult DBA/2 mice after peripheral inoculation, strain HSZP was never found to be lethal for adult mice. Whereas ANGpath-infected mice which survived acute infection frequently (79%) developed latency in the regional sensory ganglion (as proved by virus reactivation during explantation), latent HSZP reactivated in ganglion culture at a considerably reduced rate (21%). Only 10-day-old DBA/2 mice were sensitive to HSZP infection. In these, HSZP spread from the site of peripheral administration mainly by hematogenous route. The neural spread of HSZP in suckling DBA/2 mice was manifested by the involvement of vegetative neurons in the wall of the small intestine and in the retroperitoneal vegetative ganglia. We conclude that HSZP, a polykaryocyte-forming strain with a mutation in the syn3 region II, shows limited neuroinvasity for mice after peripheral administration.

# Gene: CELSR1 (10 abstracts)
### CELSR1 - Abstract 1: Seven pass Cadherins CELSR1-3.
<Journal>: Seminars in cell & developmental biology
<Date>: 2017 Sep
<PMID>: 28716607
<Content>: Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptors 1, 2 and 3 (CELSR1-3) form a family  of three atypical cadherins with multiple functions in epithelia and in the nervous system. During the past decade, evidence has accumulated for a key role of CELSR1 in epithelial planar cell polarity (PCP), and for CELSR2 and CELSR3 in ciliogenesis and neural development, especially neuron migration and axon guidance in the central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems. Phenotypes in mutant mice indicate that CELSR proteins work in concert with FZD3 and FZD6, but several questions remain. Apart from PCP signaling pathways implicating CELSR1 that begin to be unraveled, little is known about other signals generated by CELSR2 and CELSR3. A crucial question concerns the putative ligands that trigger signaling, in particular what is the role of WNT factors. Another critical issue is the identification of novel intracellular pathways and effectors that relay and transmit signals in receptive cells? Answers to those questions should further our understanding of the role of those important molecules not only in development but also in regeneration and disease.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 2: Upregulation of CELSR1 expression promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation,  migration, and invasion.
<Journal>: Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)
<Date>: 2023 Dec 9
<PMID>: 38070011
<Content>: Cadherin epidermal growth factor and laminin-G seven-pass G-type receptor 1  (CELSR1) is a planar cell polarity protein involved in the transmission of directional cues to align either individual cells within an epithelial sheet or multicellular clusters. CELSR1 has been suggested to play a role in glioma, breast cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia development; however, whether it has a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of CELSR1 in ovarian cancer and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. By analyzing gene expression data downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that CELSR1 expression was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues compared to that in normal ovarian tissues. High CELSR1 expression levels were associated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. Cell proliferation, scratch, and transwell assays revealed that CELSR1 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. In addition, transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that CELSR1 knockdown in T29H cells resulted in the dysregulation of the expression of 1320 genes. Further analysis revealed that genes involved in proliferation- and migration-associated signaling pathways were regulated by CELSR1. Our study demonstrates that CELSR1 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and regulates their proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 3: The adhesion GPCRs CELSR1-3 and LPHN3 engage G proteins via distinct activation  mechanisms.
<Journal>: Cell reports
<Date>: 2023 Jun 27
<PMID>: 37224017
<Content>: Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a large GPCR class that direct  diverse fundamental biological processes. One prominent mechanism for aGPCR agonism involves autoproteolytic cleavage, which generates an activating, membrane-proximal tethered agonist (TA). How universal this mechanism is for all aGPCRs is unclear. Here, we investigate G protein induction principles of aGPCRs using mammalian latrophilin 3 (LPHN3) and cadherin EGF LAG-repeat 7-transmembrane receptors 1-3 (CELSR1-3), members of two aGPCR families conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. LPHNs and CELSRs mediate fundamental aspects of brain development, yet CELSR signaling mechanisms are unknown. We find that CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient, while CELSR2 is efficiently cleaved. Despite differential autoproteolysis, CELSR1-3 all engage GalphaS, and CELSR1 or CELSR3 TA point mutants retain GalphaS coupling activity. CELSR2 autoproteolysis enhances GalphaS coupling, yet acute TA exposure alone is insufficient. These studies support that aGPCRs signal via multiple paradigms and provide insights into CELSR biological function.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 4: CELSR1 Is a Positive Regulator of Endothelial Cell Migration and Angiogenesis.
<Journal>: Biochemistry. Biokhimiia
<Date>: 2016 Jun
<PMID>: 27301287
<Content>: Cadherin is an epidermal growth factor and laminin-G seven-pass G-type receptor 1  (CELSR1) is a key component of the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that critically regulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the biological significance of CELSR1 in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. For this, we applied both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. To increase the endogenous expression of CELSR1, we used the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) technology and constructed an artificial TALE-VP64 activator. To knock down the expression of CELSR1, we generated lentivirus containing short hairpin RNA sequences targeting different regions of CELSR1 mRNA. Following up- or down-regulation of CELSR1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), we assessed in vitro cell proliferation by MTT assay, migration by scratch and transwell migration assays, and angiogenesis by tube formation analysis. We found that CELSR1 was endogenously expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HAEC. When focusing on HAEC, we found that upregulating CELSR1 expression significantly promoted cell growth, while knocking down CELSR1 inhibited the growth (p < 0.05). Using both scratch and transwell migration assays, we observed a positive correlation between CELSR1 expression and cell migratory capability. In addition, CELSR1 upregulation led to higher levels of tube formation in HAEC, while downregulating CELSR1 expression decreased tube formation (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, CELSR1-regulated migration and tube formation was mediated through disheveled segment polarity protein 3 (Dvl3). In conclusion, CELSR1 plays an important role in regulating multiple phenotypes of endothelial cells, including proliferation, migration, and formation of capillary-like structures.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 5: CELSR1 Risk Alleles in Familial Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Hypoplastic Left Heart  Syndrome.
<Journal>: Circulation. Genomic and precision medicine
<Date>: 2022 Apr
<PMID>: 35133174
<Content>: BACKGROUND: Whole-genome sequencing in families enables deciphering of congenital  heart disease causes. A shared genetic basis for familial bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was postulated. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed in affected members of 6 multiplex BAV families, an HLHS cohort of 197 probands and 546 relatives, and 813 controls. Data were filtered for rare, predicted-damaging variants that cosegregated with familial BAV and disrupted genes associated with congenital heart disease in humans and mice. Candidate genes were further prioritized by rare variant burden testing in HLHS cases versus controls. Modifier variants in HLHS proband-parent trios were sought to account for the severe developmental phenotype. RESULTS: In 5 BAV families, missense variants in 6 ontologically diverse genes for structural (SPTBN1, PAXIP1, and FBLN1) and signaling (CELSR1, PLXND1, and NOS3) proteins fulfilled filtering metrics. CELSR1, encoding cadherin epidermal growth factor laminin G seven-pass G-type receptor, was identified as a candidate gene in 2 families and was the only gene demonstrating rare variant enrichment in HLHS probands (P=0.003575). HLHS-associated CELSR1 variants included 16 missense, one splice site, and 3 noncoding variants predicted to disrupt canonical transcription factor binding sites, most of which were inherited from a parent without congenital heart disease. Filtering whole-genome sequencing data for rare, predicted-damaging variants inherited from the other parent revealed 2 cases of CELSR1 compound heterozygosity, one case of CELSR1-CELSR3 synergistic heterozygosity, and 4 cases of CELSR1-MYO15A digenic heterozygosity. CONCLUSIONS: CELSR1 is a susceptibility gene for familial BAV and HLHS, further implicating planar cell polarity pathway perturbation in congenital heart disease.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 6: CELSR1 variants are associated with partial epilepsy of childhood.
<Journal>: American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the 
<Date>: 2022 Oct
<PMID>: 36453712
<Content>: CELSR1 gene, encoding cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, is mainly  expressed in neural stem cells during the embryonic period. It plays an important role in neurodevelopment. However, the relationship between CELSR1 and disease of the central nervous system has not been defined. In this study, we performed trios-based whole-exome sequencing in a cohort of 356 unrelated cases with partial epilepsy without acquired causes and identified CELSR1 variants in six unrelated cases. The variants included one de novo heterozygous nonsense variant, one de novo heterozygous missense variant, and four compound heterozygous missense variants that had one variant was located in the extracellular region and the other in the cytoplasm. The patients with biallelic variants presented severe epileptic phenotypes, whereas those with heterozygous variants were associated with a mild epileptic phenotype of benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). These variants had no or low allele frequency in the gnomAD database. The frequencies of the CELSR1 variants in this cohort were significantly higher than those in the control populations. The evidence from ClinGen Clinical-Validity Framework suggested a strong association between CELSR1 variants and epilepsy. These findings provide evidence that CELSR1 is potentially a candidate pathogenic gene of partial epilepsy of childhood.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 7: Atypical cadherins Celsr1-3 and planar cell polarity in vertebrates.
<Journal>: Progress in molecular biology and translational science
<Date>: 2013
<PMID>: 23481196
<Content>: Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptors 1, 2, and 3 (Celsr1-3) form a family  of three atypical cadherins with multiple functions in epithelia and in the nervous system. During the past decade, evidence has accumulated for important and distinct roles of Celsr1-3 in planar cell polarity (PCP) during the development of the brain and some other organs. Although Celsr function in PCP is conserved from flies to mammals, other functions may be more distantly related, with Celsr working only with one or a subset of the classical core PCP partners. Here, we review the literature on Celsr, focusing on PCP and particularly on brain development.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 8: Celsr1, a neural-specific gene encoding an unusual seven-pass transmembrane  receptor, maps to mouse chromosome 15 and human chromosome 22qter.
<Journal>: Genomics
<Date>: 1997 Oct 1
<PMID>: 9339365
<Content>: We have identified Celsr1, a gene that encodes a developmentally regulated  vertebrate seven-pass transmembrane protein. The extracellular domain of Celsr1 contains two regions each with homology to distinct classes of well-characterized motifs found in the extra-cellular domains of many cell surface molecules. The most N-terminal region contains a block of contiguous cadherin repeats, and C-terminal to this is a region containing seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats interrupted by two laminin A G-type repeats. Celsr1 is unique in that it contains this combination of repeats coupled to a seven-pass transmembrane domain. As part of the characterization of the Celsr1 gene, we have determined its chromosomal map location in both mouse and human. The European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross (EUCIB) and BXD recombinant inbred strains were used for mapping Celsr1 cDNA clones in the mouse, and fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to map human Celsr1 cosmid clones on metaphase chromosomes. We report that Celsr1 maps to proximal mouse Chromosome 15 and human chromosome 22qter, a region of conserved synteny. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and in situ hybridization were used to determine the spatial restriction of Celsr1 transcripts in adult and embryonic mice. The results presented here extend our previous finding of expression of the Celsr1 receptor in the embryo and show that expression continues into adult life when expression in the brain is localized principally in the ependymal cell layer, choroid plexus, and the area postrema.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 9: Role of the planar cell polarity gene CELSR1 in neural tube defects and caudal  agenesis.
<Journal>: Birth defects research. Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology
<Date>: 2012 Mar
<PMID>: 22371354
<Content>: BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects (NTDs), including anencephaly and spina bifida,  have a complex etiology. Defects in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway have been strongly associated with NTDs in animal models and human cohorts. In this genetic study, we examined the core PCP gene CELSR1 in NTDs and caudal agenesis cases to determine whether mutations at this gene predispose to these defects. METHODS: We sequenced the coding region and the exon-intron junctions of CELSR1 in a cohort of 473 patients affected with various forms of open and closed NTDs (412) or caudal agenesis (61). Novel and rare variants (<1%) were genotyped in a cohort of 639 ethnically-matched individuals. The effect of novel missense mutations absent in controls and in public databases on protein function was predicted in silico. RESULTS: We identified in our cohort one nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CELSR1 that truncates the majority of the protein in one patient with NTD and one in-frame 12 bp deletion that removes a putative PKC phosphorylation "SSR" motif in one caudal agenesis patient. We also detected a total of 13 novel missense variants in 12 patients (11 NTDs and 1 caudal agenesis) that were predicted to be pathogenic in silico. CONCLUSIONS: We detected novel CELSR1 mutations predicted to be pathogenic in 2.9% of our NTD cohort and 3.3% of our caudal agenesis cohort. Our findings implicate CELSR1 as a risk factor for NTDs or caudal agenesis and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.

### CELSR1 - Abstract 10: Overexpression of circ_CELSR1 facilitates paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer  by regulating miR-149-5p/SIK2 axis.
<Journal>: Anti-cancer drugs
<Date>: 2021 Jun 1
<PMID>: 33735118
<Content>: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as vital regulators in the chemoresistance  of diverse human tumors, including ovarian cancer. In the present study, we attempted to explore the function of circ_CELSR1 in paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted for the expression of circ_CELSR1, miR-149-5p and salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of paclitaxel and cell viability. Colony formation assay was adopted for cell colony formation. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to analyze cell cycle process and apoptosis. Western blot assay was utilized to determine the protein levels. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to verify the association between miR-149-5p and circ_CELSR1 or SIK2. Murine xenograft model assay was carried out to determine the effect of circ_CELSR1 in paclitaxel resistance in vivo. Circ_CELSR1 was upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer tissues and cells. Circ_CELSR1 knockdown enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity and cell apoptosis and repressed cell viability, colony formation and cell cycle process in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells. For mechanism analysis, circ_CELSR1 could positively modulate SIK2 expression via sponging miR-149-5p. MiR-149-5p inhibition effectively restored the impacts of circ_CELSR1 knockdown on paclitaxel resistance and cell progression in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells. MiR-149-5p overexpression suppressed paclitaxel resistance and cell progression in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells by interacting with SIK2. In addition, circ_CELSR1 silencing impeded paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer in vivo. Circ_CELSR1 improved the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel by regulating miR-149-5p/SIK2 axis.

# Gene: PACSIN2 (10 abstracts)
### PACSIN2 - Abstract 1: PACSIN2 as a modulator of autophagy and mercaptopurine cytotoxicity: mechanisms  in lymphoid and intestinal cells.
<Journal>: Life science alliance
<Date>: 2023 Mar
<PMID>: 36596605
<Content>: PACSIN2 variants are associated with gastrointestinal effects of thiopurines and  thiopurine methyltransferase activity through an uncharacterized mechanism that is postulated to involve autophagy. This study aims to clarify the role of PACSIN2 in autophagy and in thiopurine cytotoxicity in leukemic and intestinal models. Higher autophagy and lower PACSIN2 levels were observed in inflamed compared with non-inflamed colon biopsies of inflammatory bowel disease pediatric patients at diagnosis. PACSIN2 was identified as an inhibitor of autophagy, putatively through inhibition of autophagosome formation by a protein-protein interaction with LC3-II, mediated by a LIR motif. Moreover, PACSIN2 resulted a modulator of mercaptopurine-induced cytotoxicity in intestinal cells, suggesting that PACSIN2-regulated autophagy levels might influence thiopurine sensitivity. However, PACSIN2 modulates cellular thiopurine methyltransferase activity via mechanisms distinct from its modulation of autophagy.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 2: Reciprocal interactions among Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 regulate drug  resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.
<Journal>: Cancer medicine
<Date>: 2022 Nov
<PMID>: 35352878
<Content>: Cobll1 affects blast crisis (BC) progression and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). PACSIN2, a novel Cobll1 binding protein, activates TKI-induced apoptosis in K562 cells, and this activation is suppressed by Cobll1 through the interaction between PACSIN2 and Cobll1. PACSIN2 also binds and inhibits SH3BP1 which activates the downstream Rac1 pathway and induces TKI resistance. PACSIN2 competitively interacts with Cobll1 or SH3BP1 with a higher affinity for Cobll1. Cobll1 preferentially binds to PACSIN2, releasing SH3BP1 to promote the SH3BP1/Rac1 pathway and suppress TKI-mediated apoptosis and eventually leading to TKI resistance. Similar interactions among Cobll1, PACSIN2, and SH3BP1 control hematopoiesis during vertebrate embryogenesis. Clinical analysis showed that most patients with CML have Cobll1 and SH3BP1 expression at the BC phase and BC patients with Cobll1 and SH3BP1 expression showed severe progression with a higher blast percentage than those without any Cobll1, PACSIN2, or SH3BP1 expression. Our study details the molecular mechanism of the Cobll1/PACSIN2/SH3BP1 pathway in regulating drug resistance and BC progression in CML.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 3: A junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex coordinates VE-cadherin trafficking  for endothelial migration and angiogenesis.
<Journal>: Nature communications
<Date>: 2021 May 10
<PMID>: 33972531
<Content>: Angiogenic sprouting relies on collective migration and coordinated  rearrangements of endothelial leader and follower cells. VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions have emerged as key cell-cell contacts that transmit forces between cells and trigger signals during collective cell migration in angiogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern these processes and their functional importance for vascular development still remain unknown. We previously showed that the F-BAR protein PACSIN2 is recruited to tensile asymmetric adherens junctions between leader and follower cells. Here we report that PACSIN2 mediates the formation of endothelial sprouts during angiogenesis by coordinating collective migration. We show that PACSIN2 recruits the trafficking regulators EHD4 and MICAL-L1 to the rear end of asymmetric adherens junctions to form a recycling endosome-like tubular structure. The junctional PACSIN2/EHD4/MICAL-L1 complex controls local VE-cadherin trafficking and thereby coordinates polarized endothelial migration and angiogenesis. Our findings reveal a molecular event at force-dependent asymmetric adherens junctions that occurs during the tug-of-war between endothelial leader and follower cells, and allows for junction-based guidance during collective migration in angiogenesis.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 4: Possible regulation of caveolar endocytosis and flattening by phosphorylation of  F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2/Syndapin II.
<Journal>: Bioarchitecture
<Date>: 2015
<PMID>: 26745030
<Content>: Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. The BAR domain  proteins form crescent-shaped dimers, and their oligomeric filaments are considered to form spirals at the necks of invaginations, such as clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. PACSIN2/Syndapin II is one of the BAR domain-containing proteins, and is localized at the necks of caveolae. PACSIN2 is thought to function in the scission and stabilization of caveolae, through binding to dynamin-2 and EHD2, respectively. These two functions are considered to be switched by PACSIN2 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) upon hypotonic stress and sheer stress. The phosphorylation decreases the membrane binding affinity of PACSIN2, leading to its removal from caveolae. The removal of the putative oligomeric spiral of PACSIN2 from caveolar membrane invaginations could lead to the deformation of caveolae. Indeed, PACSIN2 removal from caveolae is accompanied by the recruitment of dynamin-2, suggesting that the removal provides space for the function of dynamin-2. Otherwise, the removal of PACSIN2 decreases the stability of caveolae, which could result in the flattening of caveolae. In contrast, an increase in the amount of EHD2 restored caveolar stability. Therefore, PACSIN2 at caveolae stabilizes caveolae, but its removal by phosphorylation could induce both caveolar endocytosis and flattening.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 5: PACSIN2 Interacts with Nonstructural Protein 5A and Regulates Hepatitis C Virus  Assembly.
<Journal>: Journal of virology
<Date>: 2020 Feb 14
<PMID>: 31801866
<Content>: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major etiologic agent of chronic liver diseases. HCV  is highly dependent on cellular machinery for viral propagation. Using protein microarray analysis, we previously identified 90 cellular proteins as nonstructural 5A (NS5A) interacting partners. Of these, protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons protein 2 (PACSIN2) was selected for further study. PACSIN2 belongs to the PACSIN family, which is involved in the formation of caveolae. Protein interaction between NS5A and PACSIN2 was confirmed by pulldown assay and further verified by both coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. We showed that PACSIN2 interacted with domain I of NS5A and the Fer-CIP4 homology (FCH)-Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) region of PACSIN2. Interestingly, NS5A specifically attenuated protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha)-mediated phosphorylation of PACSIN2 at serine 313 by interrupting PACSIN2 and PKCalpha interaction. In fact, mutation of the serine 313 to alanine (S313A) of PACSIN2 increased protein interaction with NS5A. Silencing of PACSIN2 decreased both viral RNA and protein expression levels of HCV. Ectopic expression of the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant PACSIN2 recovered the viral infectivity, suggesting that PACSIN2 was specifically required for HCV propagation. PACSIN2 was involved in viral assembly without affecting other steps of the HCV life cycle. Indeed, overexpression of PACSIN2 promoted NS5A and core protein (core) interaction. We further showed that inhibition of PKCalpha increased NS5A and core interaction, suggesting that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 might influence HCV assembly. Moreover, PACSIN2 was required for lipid droplet formation via modulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that HCV modulates PACSIN2 via NS5A to promote virion assembly.IMPORTANCE PACSIN2 is a lipid-binding protein that triggers the tubulation of the phosphatidic acid-containing membranes. The functional involvement of PACSIN2 in the virus life cycle has not yet been demonstrated. We showed that phosphorylation of PACSIN2 displayed a negative effect on NS5A and core interaction. The most significant finding is that NS5A prevents PKCalpha from binding to PACSIN2. Therefore, the phosphorylation level of PACSIN2 is decreased in HCV-infected cells. We showed that HCV NS5A interrupted PKCalpha-mediated PACSIN2 phosphorylation at serine 313, thereby promoting NS5A-PACSIN2 interaction. We further demonstrated that PACSIN2 modulated lipid droplet formation through ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These data provide evidence that PACSIN2 is a proviral cellular factor required for viral propagation.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 6: RNAi screen reveals a role for PACSIN2 and caveolins during bacterial  cell-to-cell spread.
<Journal>: Molecular biology of the cell
<Date>: 2019 Aug 1
<PMID>: 31242077
<Content>: Listeria monocytogenes is a human bacterial pathogen that disseminates through  host tissues using a process called cell-to-cell spread. This critical yet understudied virulence strategy resembles a vesicular form of intercellular trafficking that allows L. monocytogenes to move between host cells without escaping the cell. Interestingly, eukaryotic cells can also directly exchange cellular components via intercellular communication pathways (e.g., trans-endocytosis) using cell-cell adhesion, membrane trafficking, and membrane remodeling proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that L. monocytogenes would hijack these types of host proteins during spread. Using a focused RNA interference screen, we identified 22 host genes that are important for L. monocytogenes spread. We then found that caveolins (CAV1 and CAV2) and the membrane sculpting F-BAR protein PACSIN2 promote L. monocytogenes protrusion engulfment during spread, and that PACSIN2 specifically localizes to protrusions. Overall, our study demonstrates that host intercellular communication pathways may be coopted during bacterial spread and that specific trafficking and membrane remodeling proteins promote bacterial protrusion resolution.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 7: The F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2 associates with Rac1 and regulates cell  spreading and migration.
<Journal>: Journal of cell science
<Date>: 2011 Jul 15
<PMID>: 21693584
<Content>: The Rac1 GTPase controls cytoskeletal dynamics and is a key regulator of cell  spreading and migration mediated by signaling through effector proteins, such as the PAK kinases and the Scar and WAVE proteins. We previously identified a series of regulatory proteins that associate with Rac1 through its hypervariable C-terminal domain, including the Rac1 activator beta-Pix (also known as Rho guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor 7) and the membrane adapter caveolin-1. Here, we show that Rac1 associates, through its C-terminus, with the F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2, an inducer of membrane tubulation and a regulator of endocytosis. We show that Rac1 localizes with PACSIN2 at intracellular tubular structures and on early endosomes. Active Rac1 induces a loss of PACSIN2-positive tubular structures. By contrast, Rac1 inhibition results in an accumulation of PACSIN2-positive tubules. In addition, PACSIN2 appears to regulate Rac1 signaling; siRNA-mediated loss of PACSIN2 increases the levels of Rac1-GTP and promotes cell spreading and migration in a wound healing assay. Moreover, ectopic expression of PACSIN2 reduces Rac1-GTP levels in a fashion that is dependent on the PACSIN2-Rac1 interaction, on the membrane-tubulating capacity of PACSIN2 and on dynamin. These data identify the BAR-domain protein PACSIN2 as a Rac1 interactor that regulates Rac1-mediated cell spreading and migration.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 8: PACSIN2 accelerates nephrin trafficking and is up-regulated in diabetic kidney  disease.
<Journal>: FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for 
<Date>: 2017 Sep
<PMID>: 28550045
<Content>: Nephrin is a core component of podocyte (glomerular epithelial cell) slit  diaphragm and is required for kidney ultrafiltration. Down-regulation or mislocalization of nephrin has been observed in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), characterized by albuminuria. Here, we investigate the role of protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons 2 (PACSIN2), a regulator of endocytosis and recycling, in the trafficking of nephrin and development of DKD. We observe that PACSIN2 is up-regulated and nephrin mislocalized in podocytes of obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats that have altered renal function. In cultured podocytes, PACSIN2 and nephrin colocalize and interact. We show that nephrin is endocytosed in PACSIN2-positive membrane regions and that PACSIN2 overexpression increases both nephrin endocytosis and recycling. We identify rabenosyn-5, which is involved in early endosome maturation and endosomal sorting, as a novel interaction partner of PACSIN2. Interestingly, rabenosyn-5 expression is increased in podocytes in obese ZDF rats, and, in vitro, its overexpression enhances the association of PACSIN2 and nephrin. We also show that palmitate, which is elevated in diabetes, enhances this association. Collectively, PACSIN2 is up-regulated and nephrin is abnormally localized in podocytes of diabetic ZDF rats. In vitro, PACSIN2 enhances nephrin turnover apparently via a mechanism involving rabenosyn-5. The data suggest that elevated PACSIN2 expression accelerates nephrin trafficking and associates with albuminuria.-Dumont, V., Tolvanen, T. A., Kuusela, S., Wang, H., Nyman, T. A., Lindfors, S., Tienari, J., Nisen, H., Suetsugu, S., Plomann, M., Kawachi, H., Lehtonen, S. PACSIN2 accelerates nephrin trafficking and is up-regulated in diabetic kidney disease.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 9: PACSIN2 rs2413739 influence on thiopurine pharmacokinetics: validation studies in  pediatric patients.
<Journal>: The pharmacogenomics journal
<Date>: 2020 Jun
<PMID>: 31792371
<Content>: The aim of the study was to validate the impact of the single-nucleotide  polymorphism rs2413739 (T > C) in the PACSIN2 gene on thiopurines pharmacological parameters and clinical response in an Italian cohort of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In ALL, PACSIN2 rs2413739 T allele was associated with a significant reduction of TPMT activity in erythrocytes (p = 0.0094, linear mixed-effect model, multivariate analysis considering TPMT genotype) and increased severe gastrointestinal toxicity during consolidation therapy (p = 0.049). A similar trend was present also for severe hematological toxicity during maintenance. In IBD, no significant effect of rs2413739 could be found on TPMT activity, however azathioprine effectiveness was reduced in patients carrying the T allele (linear mixed effect, p = 0.0058). In PBMC from healthy donors, a positive correlation between PACSIN2 and TPMT protein concentration could be detected (linear mixed effect, p = 0.045). These results support the role of PACSIN2 polymorphism on TPMT activity and mercaptopurine adverse effects in patients with ALL. Further evidence on PBMC and pediatric patients with IBD supports an association between PACSIN2 variants, TPMT activity, and thiopurines effects, even if more studies are needed since some of these effects may be tissue specific.

### PACSIN2 - Abstract 10: Phosphorylation of PACSIN2 by protein kinase C triggers the removal of caveolae  from the plasma membrane.
<Journal>: Journal of cell science
<Date>: 2015 Aug 1
<PMID>: 26092940
<Content>: PACSIN2, a membrane-sculpting BAR domain protein, localizes to caveolae. Here, we  found that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates PACSIN2 at serine 313, thereby decreasing its membrane binding and tubulation capacities. Concomitantly, phosphorylation decreased the time span for which caveolae could be tracked at the plasma membrane (the 'tracking duration'). Analyses of the phospho-mimetic S313E mutant suggested that PACSIN2 phosphorylation was sufficient to reduce caveolar-tracking durations. Both hypotonic treatment and isotonic drug-induced PKC activation increased PACSIN2 phosphorylation at serine 313 and shortened caveolar-tracking durations. Caveolar-tracking durations were also reduced upon the expression of other membrane-binding-deficient PACSIN2 mutants or upon RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated PACSIN2 depletion, pointing to a role for PACSIN2 levels in modulating the lifetime of caveolae. Interestingly, the decrease in membrane-bound PACSIN2 was inversely correlated with the recruitment and activity of dynamin 2, a GTPase that mediates membrane scission. Furthermore, expression of EHD2, which stabilizes caveolae and binds to PACSIN2, restored the tracking durations of cells with reduced PACSIN2 levels. These findings suggest that the PACSIN2 phosphorylation decreases its membrane-binding activity, thereby decreasing its stabilizing effect on caveolae and triggering dynamin-mediated removal of caveolae.

# Gene: CECR2 (10 abstracts)
### CECR2 - Abstract 1: CECR2 drives breast cancer metastasis by promoting NF-kappaB signaling and  macrophage-mediated immune suppression.
<Journal>: Science translational medicine
<Date>: 2022 Feb 2
<PMID>: 35108062
<Content>: Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related deaths due to the lack of  effective therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that certain epigenetic and transcriptional regulators drive cancer metastasis and could be targeted for metastasis treatment. To identify epigenetic regulators of breast cancer metastasis, we profiled the transcriptomes of matched pairs of primary breast tumors and metastases from human patients. We found that distant metastases are more immune inert with increased M2 macrophages compared to their matched primary tumors. The acetyl-lysine reader, cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2), was the top up-regulated epigenetic regulator in metastases associated with an increased abundance of M2 macrophages and worse metastasis-free survival. CECR2 was required for breast cancer metastasis in multiple mouse models, with more profound effect in the immunocompetent setting. Mechanistically, the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) family member v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA) recruits CECR2 to increase chromatin accessibility and activate the expression of their target genes. These target genes include multiple metastasis-promoting genes, such as TNC, MMP2, and VEGFA, and cytokine genes CSF1 and CXCL1, which are critical for immunosuppression at metastatic sites. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of CECR2 bromodomain impeded NF-kappaB-mediated immune suppression by macrophages and inhibited breast cancer metastasis. These results reveal that targeting CECR2 may be a strategy to treat metastatic breast cancer.

### CECR2 - Abstract 2: Optical controlled and nuclear targeted CECR2 competitor to downregulate CSF-1  for metastatic breast cancer immunotherapy.
<Journal>: Biomaterials
<Date>: 2024 Jul
<PMID>: 38615488
<Content>: The crosstalk between breast cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs)  greatly contributes to tumor progression and immunosuppression. In this work, cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2) is identified to overexpress in breast cancer patients, which can recognize v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RelA) and activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) to release colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Pharmacological inhibition of CECR2 by the bromodomain competitor (Bromosporine, Bro) can downregulate CSF-1 to inhibit M2 type TAMs. To amplify the immunotherapeutic effect, a chimeric peptide-based and optical controlled CECR2 competitor (designated as N-PB) is constructed to enhance the nuclear targeted delivery of Bro and initiate an immunogenic cell death (ICD). In vivo results indicate a favorable breast cancer targeting ability and primary tumor suppression effect of N-PB under optical irradiation. Importantly, N-PB downregulates CSF-1 by competitive inhibition of CECR2 and NF-kappaB(RelA) interactions, thus inhibiting immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs while improving the antitumorigenic M1-like phenotype. Ultimately, the systemic anti-tumor immunity is activated to suppress the metastatic breast cancer in an optical controlled manner. This study provides a promising therapeutic target and reliable strategy for metastatic breast cancer treatment by interrupting immunosuppressive crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages.

### CECR2 - Abstract 3: Cecr2 mutant mice as a model for human cat eye syndrome.
<Journal>: Scientific reports
<Date>: 2021 Feb 4
<PMID>: 33542446
<Content>: Cat eye syndrome (CES), a human genetic disorder caused by the inverted  duplication of a region on chromosome 22, has been known since the late 1890s. Despite the significant impact this disorder has on affected individuals, models for CES have not been produced due to the difficulty of effectively duplicating the corresponding chromosome region in an animal model. However, the study of phenotypes associated with individual genes in this region such as CECR2 may shed light on the etiology of CES. In this study we have shown that deleterious loss of function mutations in mouse Cecr2 effectively demonstrate many of the abnormal features present in human patients with CES, including coloboma and specific skeletal, kidney and heart defects. Beyond phenotypic analyses we have demonstrated the importance of utilizing multiple genetic backgrounds to study disease models, as we see major differences in penetrance of Cecr2-related abnormal phenotype between mouse strains, reminiscent of the variability in the human syndrome. These findings suggest that Cecr2 is involved in the abnormal features of CES and that Cecr2 mice can be used as a model system to study the wide range of phenotypes present in CES.

### CECR2 - Abstract 4: Cytotoxic activity of bromodomain inhibitor NVS-CECR2-1 on human cancer cells.
<Journal>: Scientific reports
<Date>: 2020 Oct 1
<PMID>: 33004947
<Content>: Bromodomain (BRD), a protein module that recognizes acetylated lysine residues on  histones and other proteins, has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target for human diseases such as cancer. While most of the studies have been focused on inhibitors against BRDs of the bromo- and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins, non-BET family BRD inhibitors remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated a potential anticancer activity of the recently developed non-BET family BRD inhibitor NVS-CECR2-1 that targets the cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 2 (CECR2). We show that NVS-CECR2-1 inhibits chromatin binding of CECR2 BRD and displaces CECR2 from chromatin within cells. NVS-CECR2-1 exhibits cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cells, killing SW48 colon cancer cells in particular with a submicromolar half maximum inhibition value mainly by inducing apoptosis. The sensitivity of the cancer cells to NVS-CECR2-1 is reduced by CECR2 depletion, suggesting that NVS-CECR2-1 exerts its activity by targeting CECR2. Interestingly, our data show that NVS-CECR2-1 also kills cancer cells by CECR2-independent mechanism. This study reports for the first time the cancer cell cytotoxic activity for NVS-CECR2-1 and provides a possibility of this BRD inhibitor to be developed as an anticancer therapeutic agent.

### CECR2 - Abstract 5: Role of chromatin remodeling gene Cecr2 in neurulation and inner ear development.
<Journal>: Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of 
<Date>: 2011 Feb
<PMID>: 21246654
<Content>: The loss of Cecr2, which encodes a chromatin remodeling protein, has been  associated with the neural tube defect (NTD) exencephaly and open eyelids in mice. Here, we show that two independent mutations of Cecr2 are also associated with specific inner ear defects. Homozygous mutant 18.5 days post coitus (dpc) fetuses exhibited smaller cochleae as well as rotational defects of sensory cells and extra cell rows in the inner ear reminiscent of planar cell polarity (PCP) mutants. Cecr2 was expressed in the neuroepithelium, head mesenchyme, and the cochlear floor. Although limited genetic interaction for NTDs was seen with Vangl2, a microarray analysis of PCP genes did not reveal a direct connection to this pathway. The mechanism of Cecr2 action in neurogenesis and inner ear development is likely complex.

### CECR2 - Abstract 6: Double whammy: the genetic variants in CECR2 and high Hcy on the development of  neural tube defects.
<Journal>: Frontiers in genetics
<Date>: 2023
<PMID>: 37424722
<Content>: Introduction: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are serious congenital malformations.  The etiology of NTDs involves both genetic and environmental factors. Loss of CECR2 in mice has been shown to result in NTDs. Our previous study indicated that high homocysteine (HHcy) levels could further reduced the expression level of CECR2. This investigation aims to explore the genetic influence of the chromatin remodeling gene, CECR2, in humans and determine if HHcy can have a synergistic effect on protein expression. Methods: We conducted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the CECR2 gene in 373 NTD cases and 222 healthy controls, followed by functional assay application to select and evaluate CECR2 missense variants and subsequent Western blotting to identify protein expression levels. Results: From the analysis, we identified nine rare, NTD-specific mutations within the CECR2 gene. Significantly, four missense variants (p.E327V, p.T521S, p.G701R, and p.G868R) were selected via functional screening. The E9.5 mouse ectodermal stem cell line NE-4C, transfected with plasmids expressing p.E327V, p.T521S, p.G868R variants or a recombinant harboring all four (named as 4Mut), exhibited notable reductions in CECR2 protein expression. Furthermore, exposure to homocysteine thiolactone (HTL), an extremely reactive homocysteine metabolite, amplified the reduction in CECR2 expression, accompanied by a significant increase in the apoptotic molecule Caspase3 activity, a potential NTD inducer. Importantly, folic acid (FA) supplementation effectively counteracted the CECR2 expression decline induced by CECR2 mutation and HTL treatment, leading to reduced apoptosis. Discussion: Our observations underscore a synergistic relationship between HHcy and genetic variations in CECR2 concerning NTDs, thereby reinforcing the concept of gene-environment interaction phenomena in NTD etiology.

### CECR2 - Abstract 7: Optimization of Potent ATAD2 and CECR2 Bromodomain Inhibitors with an Atypical  Binding Mode.
<Journal>: Journal of medicinal chemistry
<Date>: 2020 May 28
<PMID>: 32321240
<Content>: Most bromodomain inhibitors mimic the interactions of the natural acetylated  lysine (KAc) histone substrate through key interactions with conserved asparagine and tyrosine residues within the binding pocket. Herein we report the optimization of a series of phenyl sulfonamides that exhibit a novel mode of binding to non-bromodomain and extra terminal domain (non-BET) bromodomains through displacement of a normally conserved network of four water molecules. Starting from an initial hit molecule, we report its divergent optimization toward the ATPase family AAA domain containing 2 (ATAD2) and cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 2 (CECR2) domains. This work concludes with the identification of (R)-55 (GSK232), a highly selective, cellularly penetrant CECR2 inhibitor with excellent physicochemical properties.

### CECR2 - Abstract 8: Cecr2 mutations causing exencephaly trigger misregulation of  mesenchymal/ectodermal transcription factors.
<Journal>: Birth defects research. Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology
<Date>: 2010 Aug
<PMID>: 20589882
<Content>: BACKGROUND: Over 200 mouse genes are associated with neural tube defects (NTDs),  including Cecr2, the bromodomain-containing subunit of the CERF chromatin remodeling complex. METHODS: Gene-trap mutation Cecr2(Gt45Bic) results in 74% exencephaly (equivalent of human anencephaly) on the BALB/c strain. Gene expression altered during cranial neural tube closure by the Cecr2 mutation was identified through microarray analysis of 11-14 somites stage Cecr2(Gt45Bic)embryos. RESULTS: Analysis of Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 chips detected 60 transcripts up-regulated and 54 transcripts down-regulated in the Cecr2(Gt45Bic) embryos (fold > 1.5, p < 0.05). The Cecr2 transcript was reduced only approximately 7- to 14-fold from normal levels, suggesting the Cecr2(Gt45Bic) is a hypomorphic mutation. We therefore generated a novel Cecr2 null allele (Cecr2 (tm1.1Hemc)). Resulting mutants displayed a stronger penetrance of exencephaly than Cecr2(Gt45Bic) in both BALB/c and FVB/N strains, in addition to midline facial clefts and forebrain encephalocele in the FVB/N strain. The Cecr2 transcript is reduced 260-fold in the Cecr2(tm1.1Hemc) line. Subsequent qRT-PCR using Cecr2 (tm1.1Hemc) mutant heads confirmed downregulation of transcription factors Alx1/Cart1, Dlx5, Eya1, and Six1. CONCLUSIONS: As both Alx1/Cart1 and Dlx5 mouse mutations result in exencephaly, we hypothesize that changes in expression of these mesenchymal/ectodermal transcription factors may contribute to NTDs associated with Cecr2.

### CECR2 - Abstract 9: A novel tumor suppressor CECR2 down regulation links glutamine metabolism  contributes tumor growth in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
<Journal>: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of 
<Date>: 2021 Sep
<PMID>: 33826083
<Content>: PURPOSE: Glutamine plays an important role in tumor metabolism and progression.  This research aimed to find out how Gln exert their effects on laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by CCK8 and EdU assay, mitochondrial bioenergetic activity was measured by mitochondrial stress tests. Gene expression profiling was revealed by RNA sequencing and validated by RT-qPCR. In LSCC patients, protein expression in tumor and adjacent tissues was examined and scored by IHC staining. RNAi was performed by stably expressed shRNA in TU177 cells. In vivo tumor growth analysis was performed using a nude mouse tumorigenicity model. RESULTS: Gln deprivation suppressed TU177 cell proliferation, which was restored by alphaKG supplementation. By transcriptomic analysis, we identified CECR2, which encodes a histone acetyl-lysine reader, as the downstream target gene for Gln and alphaKG. In LSCC patients, the expression of CECR2 in tumors was lower than adjacent tissues. Furthermore, deficiency of CECR2 promoted tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting it has tumor suppressor effects. Besides, cell proliferation inhibited by Gln withdrawal could be restored by CECR2 depletion, and the proliferation boosted by alphaKG supplementation could be magnified either, suggested that CECR2 feedback suppressed Gln and alphaKG's effect on tumor growth. Transcriptomic profiling revealed CECR2 regulated the expression of a series of genes involved in tumor progression. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the Gln-alphaKG-CECR2 axis contributes to tumor growth in LSCC. This finding provided a potential therapeutic opportunity for the use of associated metabolites as a potential treatment for LSCC.

### CECR2 - Abstract 10: CECR2, a protein involved in neurulation, forms a novel chromatin remodeling  complex with SNF2L.
<Journal>: Human molecular genetics
<Date>: 2005 Feb 15
<PMID>: 15640247
<Content>: Chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in development. Here we  describe a transcription factor, CECR2, which is involved in neurulation and chromatin remodeling. CECR2 shows complex alternative splicing, but all variants contain DDT and bromodomain motifs. A mutant mouse line was generated from an embryonic stem cell line containing a genetrap within Cecr2. Reporter gene expression demonstrated Cecr2 expression to be predominantly neural in the embryo. Mice homozygous for the Cecr2 genetrap-induced mutation show a high penetrance of the neural tube defect exencephaly, the human equivalent of anencephaly, in a strain-dependent fashion. Biochemical isolation of CECR2 revealed the presence of this protein as a component of a novel heterodimeric complex termed CECR2-containing remodeling factor (CERF). CERF comprises CECR2 and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler SNF2L, a mammalian ISWI ortholog expressed predominantly in the central nervous system. CERF is capable of remodeling chromatin in vitro and displays an ATP hydrolyzing activity that is stimulated by nucleosomes. Together, these data identify a novel chromatin remodeling complex with a critical role in neurulation.

# Gene: LARGE1 (4 abstracts)
### LARGE1 - Abstract 1: Alteration of LARGE1 abundance in patients and a mouse model of 5q-associated  spinal muscular atrophy.
<Journal>: Acta neuropathologica
<Date>: 2024 Mar 12
<PMID>: 38470509
<Content>: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by recessive  pathogenic variants affecting the survival of motor neuron (SMN1) gene (localized on 5q). In consequence, cells lack expression of the corresponding protein. This pathophysiological condition is clinically associated with motor neuron (MN) degeneration leading to severe muscular atrophy. Additionally, vulnerability of other cellular populations and tissues including skeletal muscle has been demonstrated. Although the therapeutic options for SMA have considerably changed, treatment responses may differ thus underlining the persistent need for validated biomarkers. To address this need and to identify novel marker proteins for SMA, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling on cerebrospinal fluid derived (CSF) from genetically proven SMA type 1-3 cases and afterwards performed ELISA studies on CSF and serum samples to validate the potential of a novel biomarker candidates in both body fluids. To further decipher the pathophysiological impact of this biomarker, immunofluorescence studies were carried out on spinal cord and skeletal muscle derived from a 5q-SMA mouse model. Proteomics revealed increase of LARGE1 in CSF derived from adult patients showing a clinical response upon treatment with nusinersen. Moreover, LARGE1 levels were validated in CSF samples of further SMA patients (type 1-3) by ELISA. These studies also unveiled a distinguishment between groups in improvement of motor skills: adult patients do present with lowered level per se at baseline visit while no elevation upon treatment in the pediatric cohort can be observed. ELISA-based studies of serum samples showed no changes in the pediatric cohort but unraveled elevated level in adult patients responding to future intervention with nusinersen, while non-responders did not show a significant increase. Additional immunofluorescence studies of LARGE1 in MN and skeletal muscle of a SMA type 3 mouse model revealed an increase of LARGE1 during disease progression. Our combined data unraveled LARGE1 as a protein dysregulated in serum and CSF of SMA-patients (and in MN and skeletal muscle of SMA mice) holding the potential to serve as a disease marker for SMA and enabling to differentiate between patients responding and non-responding to therapy with nusinersen.

### LARGE1 - Abstract 2: Clinical significance of LARGE1 in progression of liver cancer and the underlying  mechanism.
<Journal>: Gene
<Date>: 2021 May 5
<PMID>: 33588034
<Content>: Liver cancer is a malignant disease and causes thousands of death each year. The  prognosis is dismal for patients with metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to disclose the cause and mechanism underlying liver cancer. LARGE1 encodes a glycosyltransferase and was reported to promote progression in cancer. But its role in liver cancer is unknown. In this study, LARGE1 displayed upregulated expression in liver cancer cells. When LARGE1 was knocked down in SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells, the ability of cell proliferation and colony formation were decreased significantly. Cell migration and invasion were suppressed. The number of cells in G1 phase increased but decreased in S phase. Cell apoptosis was not affected. Tumor growth in vivo was also inhibited. Tumor volume was decreased from 1270 mm(3) to 721 mm(3) (p < 0.05) and tumor weight from 0.95 g to 0.63 g (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression of beta-catenin, TCF and Cyclin D1 was reduced when LARGE1 was knocked down but increased in LARGE1-overexpressed cells. LGK-974, a specific inhibitor in canonical Wnt signaling, inhibited cell proliferation even when LARGE1 was over-expressed. In tumor tissues, LARGE1 was increased by 4.8 folds compared to paratumoral tissues. And higher LARGE1 expression caused shorter survival. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that LARGE1 was associated with TNM stage (Ⅰ/Ⅱ vs III/IV, p = 0.005). Therefore, LARGE1 promotes progression and regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in liver cancer.

### LARGE1 - Abstract 3: Exogenous expression of the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 restores alpha-dystroglycan  matriglycan and laminin binding in rhabdomyosarcoma.
<Journal>: Skeletal muscle
<Date>: 2019 May 4
<PMID>: 31054580
<Content>: BACKGROUND: alpha-Dystroglycan is the highly glycosylated component of the  dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that binds with high-affinity to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins containing laminin-G-like (LG) domains via a unique heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-beta1,3-Xyl-alpha1,3-](n) called matriglycan. Changes in expression of components of the DGC or in the O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan result in muscular dystrophy but are also observed in certain cancers. In mice, the loss of either of two DGC proteins, dystrophin or alpha-sarcoglycan, is associated with a high incidence of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). In addition, glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan is aberrant in a small cohort of human patients with RMS. Since both the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and its function as an ECM receptor require over 18 post-translational processing enzymes, we hypothesized that understanding its role in the pathogenesis of RMS requires a complete analysis of the expression of dystroglycan-modifying enzymes and the characterization of alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in the context of RMS. METHODS: A series of cell lines and biopsy samples from human and mouse RMS were analyzed for the glycosylation status of alpha-dystroglycan and for expression of the genes encoding the responsible enzymes, in particular those required for the addition of matriglycan. Furthermore, the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 was ectopically expressed in RMS cells to determine its effects on matriglycan modifications and the ability of alpha-dystroglycan to function as a laminin receptor. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of a collection of primary RMS tumors show that although alpha-dystroglycan is consistently expressed and glycosylated in these tumors, alpha-dystroglycan lacks matriglycan and the ability to bind laminin. Similarly, in a series of cell lines derived from human and mouse RMS, alpha-dystroglycan lacks matriglycan modification and the ability to bind laminin. RNAseq data from RMS cell lines was analyzed for expression of the genes known to be involved in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation, which revealed that, for most cell lines, the lack of matriglycan can be attributed to the downregulation of the dystroglycan-modifying enzyme LARGE1. Ectopic expression of LARGE1 in these cell cultures restored matriglycan to levels comparable to those in muscle and restored high-affinity laminin binding to alpha-dystroglycan. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a lack of matriglycan on alpha-dystroglycan is a common feature in RMS due to the downregulation of LARGE1, and that ectopic expression of LARGE1 can restore matriglycan modifications and the ability of alpha-dystroglycan to function as an ECM receptor.

### LARGE1 - Abstract 4: A novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion expanding the molecular alterations associated with  the methylation class of neuroepithelial tumors with PATZ1 fusions.
<Journal>: Acta neuropathologica communications
<Date>: 2022 Feb 3
<PMID>: 35115049
<Content>: A novel DNA methylation class of tumor within the central nervous system, the  "neuroepithelial tumor (NET), PATZ1 fusion-positive" has recently been identified in the literature, characterized by EWSR1- and MN1-PATZ1 fusions. The cellular origin of this tumor type remains unknown, wavering between glioneuronal or mesenchymal (as round cell sarcomas with EWSR1-PATZ1 of the soft tissue). Because of the low number of reported cases, this tumor type will not be added to the 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Herein, we report one case of a CNS tumor classified by DNA methylation analysis as NET-PATZ1 but harboring a novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion which has until now never been described in soft tissue or the CNS. We compare its clinical, histopathological, immunophenotypical, and genetic features with those previously described in NET-PATZ1. Interestingly, the current case presented histopathological (astroblastoma-like features, glioneuronal phenotype), clinical (with a favorable course), genetic (1p loss), and epigenetic (DNA-methylation profiling) similarities to previously reported cases of NET-PATZ1. Our results added data suggesting that different histomolecular tumor subtypes seem to be included within the methylation class "NET, PATZ1 fusion-positive", including non PATZ1 fusions, and that further cases are needed to better characterize them.

# Gene: MYO18B (10 abstracts)
### MYO18B - Abstract 1: Correlation between histone acetylation and expression of the MYO18B gene in  human lung cancer cells.
<Journal>: Genes, chromosomes & cancer
<Date>: 2004 Jun
<PMID>: 15101048
<Content>: Recently, we isolated a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, MYO18B, which was  inactivated in approximately 50% of human lung cancers by deletion, mutation, and promoter methylation. However, more frequent reduction or loss of MYO18B expression and restoration of MYO18B expression by trichostatin A (TSA) treatment suggested the contribution of other mechanisms, especially histone deacetylation, for epigenetic inactivation of the MYO18B gene. In this study, we examined histone modification of the promoter region of the MYO18B gene in 8 human lung cancer cell lines by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In 6 of 7 cell lines with reduced or silenced MYO18B expression, the levels of histones H3 and H4 acetylation surrounding the MYO18B promoter region were lower than those in a cell line with MYO18B expression. By treatment with TSA, the levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation were increased in all 6 cell lines whose MYO18B expression was restored by TSA, whereas neither H3 nor H4 acetylation was increased in cells whose MYO18B expression was not restored by TSA. Significant correlations were observed between the levels of histone H3/H4 acetylation and MYO18B expression. These results suggest that acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 contributes to regulation of MYO18B expression in lung cancer cells and that histone deacetylation surrounding the promoter region plays an important role in MYO18B silencing and is involved in lung carcinogenesis.

### MYO18B - Abstract 2: MYO18B, a candidate tumor suppressor gene at chromosome 22q12.1, deleted,  mutated, and methylated in human lung cancer.
<Journal>: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
<Date>: 2002 Sep 17
<PMID>: 12209013
<Content>: Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22q has been detected in approximately 60%  of advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) as well as small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene on 22q that is involved in lung cancer progression. Here, we isolated a myosin family gene, MYO18B, located at chromosome 22q12.1 and found that it is frequently deleted, mutated, and hypermethylated in lung cancers. Somatic MYO18B mutations were detected in 19% (14/75) of lung cancer cell lines and 13% (6/46) of primary lung cancers of both SCLC and NSCLC types. MYO18B expression was reduced in 88% (30/34) of NSCLC and 47% (8/17) of SCLC cell lines. Its expression was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in 11 of 14 cell lines with reduced MYO18B expression, and the promoter CpG island of the MYO18B gene was methylated in 17% (8/47) of lung cancer cell lines and 35% (14/40) of primary lung cancers. Furthermore, restoration of MYO18B expression in lung carcinoma cells suppressed anchorage-independent growth. These results indicate that the MYO18B gene is a strong candidate for a novel tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation is involved in lung cancer progression.

### MYO18B - Abstract 3: MYO18B promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR  signaling pathway.
<Journal>: Diagnostic pathology
<Date>: 2018 Nov 3
<PMID>: 30390677
<Content>: BACKGROUND: MYO18B has been identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene in  several cancers. However, its specific roles in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well defined. METHODS: We firstly identified the expression and prognostic values of MYO18B in HCC using TCGA cohort and our clinical data. Then, MYO18B knockdown by RNA inference was implemented to investigate the effects of MYO18B on HCC cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine gene and protein expression levels. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were performed to examine cell proliferation capacity. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to evaluate the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. RESULTS: MYO18B was overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. MYO18B expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival. Knockdown of MYO18B significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, MYO18B knockdown could effectively suppress the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, mTOR and P70S6K, suggesting that MYO18B might promote HCC progression by targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: MYO18B promoted tumor growth and migration via the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. MYO18B might be a promising target for clinical intervention of HCC.

### MYO18B - Abstract 4: Further delineation of MYO18B-related autosomal recessive Klippel-Feil syndrome  with myopathy and facial dysmorphism.
<Journal>: American journal of medical genetics. Part A
<Date>: 2021 Feb
<PMID>: 33179433
<Content>: Klippel-Feil syndrome 4 (KFS4; MIM# 616549) is an autosomal recessive disorder  caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in MYO18B and comprises, in addition to Klippel-Feil anomaly (KFA), nemaline myopathy, facial dysmorphism, and short stature. We aim to outline the natural history of KFS4 and provide an updated description of its clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular findings. We comprehensively analyzed the medical records of 6 Saudi and 1 American patients (including 5 previously unpublished cases) with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of KFS4. All patients had myopathy of varying severity that followed a slowly progressive or non-progressive course, affecting primarily the proximal musculature of the lower limb although hand involvement with distal arthrogryposis and abnormal interphalangeal creases was also observed. KFA and characteristic dysmorphic features, including ptosis and bulbous nose, were observed in all but two patients. The causal MYO18B variants were a founder NM_032608.5:c.6905C>A; p.(Ser2302*) variant in the Saudi patients (P1-P6) and a novel MYO18B homozygous variant (c.6660_6670del;p.[Arg2220Serfs*74]) in the American Caucasian patient (P7). We report the phenotypic and genetic findings in seven patients with KFS4. We describe the natural history of this disease, confirm myopathy as a universal feature and describe its pattern and progression, and note interesting differences between the phenotypes observed in patients with KFA and those without.

### MYO18B - Abstract 5: A Zebrafish Model for a Human Myopathy Associated with Mutation of the  Unconventional Myosin MYO18B.
<Journal>: Genetics
<Date>: 2017 Feb
<PMID>: 27879346
<Content>: Myosin 18B is an unconventional myosin that has been implicated in tumor  progression in humans. In addition, loss-of-function mutations of the MYO18B gene have recently been identified in several patients exhibiting symptoms of nemaline myopathy. In mouse, mutation of Myo18B results in early developmental arrest associated with cardiomyopathy, precluding analysis of its effects on skeletal muscle development. The zebrafish, frozen (fro) mutant was identified as one of a group of immotile mutants in the 1996 Tubingen genetic screen. Mutant embryos display a loss of birefringency in their skeletal muscle, indicative of disrupted sarcomeric organization. Using meiotic mapping, we localized the fro locus to the previously unannotated zebrafish myo18b gene, the product of which shares close to 50% identity with its human ortholog. Transcription of myo18b is restricted to fast-twitch myocytes in the zebrafish embryo; consistent with this, fro mutant embryos exhibit defects specifically in their fast-twitch skeletal muscles. We show that sarcomeric assembly is blocked at an early stage in fro mutants, leading to the disorganized accumulation of actin, myosin, and alpha-actinin and a complete loss of myofibrillar organization in fast-twitch muscles.

### MYO18B - Abstract 6: HOMER2 binds MYO18B and enhances its activity to suppress anchorage independent  growth.
<Journal>: Biochemical and biophysical research communications
<Date>: 2007 May 18
<PMID>: 17386922
<Content>: MYO18B is a class XVIII myosin, cloned as a tumor suppressor gene candidate. To  investigate the mechanisms of MYO18B-dependent tumor suppression, MYO18B-interacting proteins were searched for by a yeast two-hybrid screen. HOMER2, a Homer/Ves1 family protein, was identified as a binding partner of MYO18B. These proteins co-localized in the regions of membrane protrusion and stress fiber, which are known as ones with filamentous actin-rich structures. Expression of HOMER2 enhanced the ability of MYO18B to suppress anchorage-independent growth. These results indicate that HOMER2 and MYO18B cooperate together in tumor suppression.

### MYO18B - Abstract 7: Restored expression of the MYO18B gene suppresses orthotopic growth and the  production of bloody pleural effusion by human malignant pleural mesothelioma cells in SCID mice.
<Journal>: Oncology research
<Date>: 2006
<PMID>: 17294804
<Content>: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is closely related to exposure to asbestos,  and a rapid increase in the number of MPM patients is therefore estimated to occur from 2010 to 2040 in Japan. Because MPM is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis of MPM patients is extremely poor. MYO18B, a novel member of the myosin family, is a tumor suppressor gene isolated from a homozygously deleted region at 22q12.1 in a lung cancer cell line. The inactivation of the MYO18B gene plays an important role in several malignant diseases. However, the role of MYO18B in the progression of MPM is still unknown. Six different human MPM cell lines were used in this study. Western blot revealed that none of the cell lines expressed a detectable level of MYO18B protein. One of the MPM cell lines, EHMES-10, was transfected with the MYO18B gene. We found that a restored expression of the MYO18B protein in EHMES-10 cells resulted in the inhibition of their anchorage-independent growth and motility in vitro. In addition, it also inhibited their ectopic (subcutaneous space) and orthotopic (thoracic cavity) growth in SCID mice, in association with an increased degree of cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it also suppressed the production of bloody pleural effusion after orthotopic injection. These findings suggest that the restored expression of MYO18B may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of locally advanced MPM in humans.

### MYO18B - Abstract 8: Human MYO18B, a novel unconventional myosin heavy chain expressed in striated  muscles moves into the myonuclei upon differentiation.
<Journal>: Journal of molecular biology
<Date>: 2003 Feb 7
<PMID>: 12547197
<Content>: We have characterized a novel unconventional myosin heavy chain, named MYO18B,  that appears to be expressed mainly in human cardiac and skeletal muscles and, at lower levels, in testis. MYO18B transcript is detected in all types of striated muscles but at much lower levels compared to class II sarcomeric myosins, and it is up regulated after in vitro differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that this myosin belongs to the recently identified class XVIII, however, unlike the other member of this class, it seems to be unique to Vertebrate since it contains two large amino acid domains of unknown function at the N and C-termini. Immunolocalization of MYO18B protein in skeletal muscle cells shows that this myosin heavy chain is located in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated myoblasts. After in vitro differentiation into myotubes, a fraction of this protein is accumulated in a subset of myonuclei. This nuclear localization was confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments on primary cardiomyocytes and adult muscle sections. In the cytoplasm MYO18B shows a punctate staining, both in cardiac and skeletal fibers. In some cases, cardiomyocytes show a partial sarcomeric pattern of MYO18B alternating that of alpha-actinin-2. In skeletal muscle the cytoplasmic MYO18B results much more evident in the fast type fibers.

### MYO18B - Abstract 9: Reduced expression of MYO18B, a candidate tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome arm  22q, in ovarian cancer.
<Journal>: International journal of cancer
<Date>: 2004 Oct 20
<PMID>: 15305387
<Content>: Allelic imbalance on chromosome arm 22q has been detected in 50-70% of ovarian  cancers, suggesting the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on this chromosome arm that is involved in ovarian carcinogenesis. Recently, we isolated a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, MYO18B, at 22q12.1, which is deleted, mutated and hypermethylated in approximately 50% of lung cancers. In our study, we analyzed genetic and epigenetic alterations of the MYO18B gene in ovarian cancers. Missense MYO18B mutations were detected in 1 of 4 (25%) ovarian cancer cell lines and in 1 of 17 (5.9%) primary ovarian cancers. MYO18B expression was reduced in all 4 ovarian cancer cell lines and in 12 of 17 (71%) of primary ovarian cancers. MYO18B expression was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A in 3 of 4 cell lines with reduced MYO18B expression, and hypermethylation of the promoter CpG island for MYO18B was observed in 2 of these 3 cell lines. Its hypermethylation was also observed in 2 of 15 (13%) primary ovarian cancers. Thus, it was indicated that MYO18B expression is reduced in a considerable fraction of ovarian cancers by several mechanisms, including hypermethylation, while the MYO18B gene is mutated in a small subset of ovarian cancers. The present results suggest that MYO18B alterations, including both epigenetic and genetic alterations, play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis.

### MYO18B - Abstract 10: MYO18B interacts with the proteasomal subunit Sug1 and is degraded by the  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
<Journal>: Biochemical and biophysical research communications
<Date>: 2006 Apr 14
<PMID>: 16499872
<Content>: MYO18B is a class XVIIIB unconventional myosin encoded by a candidate tumor  suppressor gene. To gain insights into the cellular function of this protein, we searched for MYO18B-interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Sug1, a 19S regulator subunit of the 26S proteasome, was identified as a binding partner of the C-terminal tail region of MYO18B. The association of MYO18B with Sug1 was further confirmed by GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, proteasome dysfunction by a proteasome inhibitor or siRNA-mediated knock-down of Sug1 caused the up-regulation of MYO18B protein and MYO18B was polyubiquitinated in vivo. Collectively, these results suggested that MYO18B is a substrate for proteasomal degradation.

# Gene: TAFA5 (2 abstracts)
### TAFA5 - Abstract 1: TAFA5 promotes proliferation and migration in gastric cancer.
<Journal>: Molecular medicine reports
<Date>: 2019 Nov
<PMID>: 31702029
<Content>: TAFA chemokine like family member 5 (TAFA5), a TAFA family member that encodes  small secreted proteins in the central nervous system, has been demonstrated to have increased expression in human malignancies. However, the expression and function of TAFA5 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In the present study, public datasets and human GC samples were used to determine the TAFA5 expression levels. The results revealed that TAFA5 was upregulated in GC when compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of TAFA5 in GC was associated with poor differentiation, and worse tumor, nodal and metastasis stages. In addition, high TAFA5 expression was correlated with unfavorable patient prognoses. In vitro experiments indicated that downregulation of TAFA5 inhibited the proliferation and migration of GC cell lines. Finally, the results from gene set enrichment analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that TAFA5 expression was significantly correlated with genes associated with epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, which was further confirmed by western blot analysis. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that TAFA5 had significant effects on GC progression, suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for GC therapy.

### TAFA5 - Abstract 2: FAM19A5/TAFA5, a novel neurokine, plays a crucial role in depressive-like and  spatial memory-related behaviors in mice.
<Journal>: Molecular psychiatry
<Date>: 2021 Jun
<PMID>: 32317715
<Content>: FAM19A5/TAFA5 is a member of the family with sequence similarity 19 with unknown  function in emotional and cognitive regulation. Here, we reported that FAM19A5 was highly expressed in the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain, especially in the hippocampus. Behaviorally, genetic deletion of Fam19a5 resulted in increased depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. These behavioral alterations were associated with the decreased expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, as well as significantly reduced glutamate release and neuronal activity in the hippocampus. Subsequently, these changes led to the decreased density of dendritic spines. In recent years, the roles of chronic stress participating in the development of depression have become increasingly clear, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. We found that the levels of FAM19A5 in plasma and hippocampus of chronic stress-treated mice were significantly decreased whereas overexpression of human FAM19A5 selectively in the hippocampus could attenuate chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Taken together, our results revealed for the first time that FAM19A5 plays a key role in the regulation of depression and spatial cognition in the hippocampus. Furthermore, our study provided a new mechanism for chronic stress-induced depression, and also provided a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and a new strategy for the treatment of depression.
